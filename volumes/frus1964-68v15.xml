                <head>Preface</head>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> of the United States series presents the
          official documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and significant
          diplomatic activity of the United States Government. The series documents the facts and
          events that contributed to the formulation of policies and includes evidence of supporting
          and alternative views to the policy positions ultimately adopted.</p>
                <p>The Historian of the Department of State is charged with the responsibility for the
          preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The staff of the
          Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, plans, researches, compiles, and edits
          the volumes in the series. This documentary editing proceeds in full accord with the
          generally accepted standards of historical scholarship. Official regulations codifying
          specific standards for the selection and editing of documents for the series were first
          promulgated by Secretary of State Frank B. Kellogg on March 26, 1925. These regulations,
          with minor modifications, guided the series through 1991.</p>
                <p>A new statutory charter for the preparation of the series was established by Public Law
          102–138, the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1992
          and 1993, which was signed by President <persName>George Bush</persName> on October 28,
          1991. Section 198 of P.L. 102–138 added a new Title IV to the Department of State's Basic
          Authorities Act of 1956 (22 USC 4351, et seq.).</p>
                <p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be a
          thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major United States foreign policy decisions
          and significant United States diplomatic activity. The volumes of the series should
          include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation of major foreign policy
          decisions and actions of the United States Government. The statute also confirms the
          editing principles established by Secretary Kellogg: the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
            Relations</hi> series is guided by the principles of historical objectivity and
          accuracy; records should not be altered or deletions made without indicating in the
          published text that a deletion has been made; the published record should omit no facts
          that were of major importance in reaching a decision; and nothing should be omitted for
          the purposes of concealing a defect in policy. The statute also requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be published not more than 30 years after
          the events recorded. The editor is convinced that this volume, which was compiled in
          1994–1996, meets all regulatory, statutory, and scholarly standards of selection and
          editing.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Structure and Scope of the Foreign Relations Series</p>
                <p>This volume is part of a subseries of volumes of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
            Relations</hi> series that documents the most important issues in the foreign policy of
            <pb n="IV" xml:id="pg_IV" facs="0004"/>the 5 years (1964–1968) of the administration of
            <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName>. The subseries presents in 34
          volumes a documentary record of major foreign policy decisions and actions of President
            <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s administration. This volume documents
          U.S. policy toward the Federal Republic of Germany and the Berlin question.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Principles of Document Selection for the Foreign Relations
          Series</p>
                <p>In preparing each volume of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series, the
          editors are guided by some general principles for the selection of documents. Each editor,
          in consultation with the General Editor and other senior editors, determines the
          particular issues and topics to be documented either in detail, in brief, or in
          summary.</p>
                <p>The following general selection criteria are used in preparing volumes in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. Individual compiler-editors vary these
          criteria in accordance with the particular issues and the available documentation. The
          editors also apply these selection criteria in accordance with their own interpretation of
          the generally accepted standards of scholarship. In selecting documentation for
          publication, the editors gave priority to unpublished classified records, rather than
          previously published records (which are accounted for in appropriate bibliographical
          notes).</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Selection Criteria (in general order of priority):</p>
                <p>1. Major foreign affairs commitments made on behalf of the United States to other
          governments, including those that define or identify the principal foreign affairs
          interests of the United States;</p>
                <p>2. Major foreign affairs issues, commitments, negotiations, and activities, whether or
          not major decisions were made, and including dissenting or alternative opinions to the
          process ultimately adopted;</p>
                <p>3. The decisions, discussions, actions, and considerations of the President, as the
          official constitutionally responsible for the direction of foreign policy;</p>
                <p>4. The discussions and actions of the National Security Council, the Cabinet, and special
          Presidential policy groups, including the policy options brought before these bodies or
          their individual members;</p>
                <p>5. The policy options adopted by or considered by the Secretary of State and the most
          important actions taken to implement Presidential decisions or policies;</p>
                <p>6. Diplomatic negotiations and conferences, official correspondence, and other exchanges
          between U.S. representatives and those of other governments that demonstrate the main
          lines of policy implementation on major issues;</p>
                <p>7. Important elements of information that attended Presidential decisions and policy
          recommendations of the Secretary of State;</p>
                <pb n="V" xml:id="pg_V" facs="0005"/>
                <p>8. Major foreign affairs decisions, negotiations, and commitments undertaken on behalf of
          the United States by government officials and representatives in other agencies in the
          foreign affairs community or other branches of government made without the involvement (or
          even knowledge) of the White House or the Department of State;</p>
                <p>9. The main policy lines of intelligence activities if they constituted major aspects of
          U.S. foreign policy toward a nation or region or if they provided key information in the
          formulation of major U.S. policies, including relevant National Intelligence Estimates and
          Special National Intelligence Estimates as may be declassified;</p>
                <p>10. The role of the Congress in the preparation and execution of particular foreign
          policies or foreign affairs actions;</p>
                <p>11. Economic aspects of foreign policy;</p>
                <p>12. The main policy lines of U.S. military and economic assistance as well as other types
          of assistance;</p>
                <p>13. The political-military recommendations, decisions, and activities of the military
          establishment and major regional military commands as they bear upon the formulation or
          execution of major U.S. foreign policies;</p>
                <p>14. Diplomatic appointments that reflect major policies or affect policy changes.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Sources for the Foreign Relations Series</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute requires that the published record
          in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series include all records needed to
          provide comprehensive documentation on major U.S. foreign policy decisions and significant
          U.S. diplomatic activity. It further requires that government agencies, departments, and
          other entities of the U.S. Government engaged in foreign policy formulation, execution, or
          support cooperate with the Department of State Historian by providing full and complete
          access to records pertinent to foreign policy decisions and actions and by providing
          copies of selected records. Many of the sources consulted in the preparation of this
          volume have been declassified and are available for review at the National Archives and
          Records Administration. The declassification review and opening for public review of all
          Department of State records no later than 30 years after the events is mandated by the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute. The Department of State and other record
          sources used in the volume are described in detail in the section on Sources below.</p>
                <p>Focus of Research and Principles of Selection for Foreign Relations, 1964–1968, Volume
          XV</p>
                <p>The editor of the volume sought to include documentation illuminating the foreign
          policymaking process of the U.S. Government, with <pb n="VI" xml:id="pg_VI" facs="0006"/>emphasis on the highest level at which policy on a particular subject was determined.
          The documents include memoranda and records of discussions that set forth policy issues
          and show decisions or actions taken. The emphasis is on the development of U.S. policy and
          on major aspects and repercussions of its execution rather than on the details of policy
          execution.</p>
                <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> made major foreign policy
          decisions himself with the advice of top administration officials. The editor sought to
          document, as far as possible, the President's decision-making. Although the record of
          policy formulation in the <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> administration is
          voluminous, many discussions between <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and
          his advisers were not recorded. The record of both President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s and Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>'s involvement in the policymaking process was assembled by the editor
          from a wide spectrum of files.</p>
                <p>The volume focuses on the German issues that primarily engaged high-level U.S.
          policymakers: 1) U.S. efforts to retain a privileged relationship with the Federal
          Republic of Germany's leadership; 2) the attempts of U.S. policymakers to provide
          carefully measured support for West German initiatives aimed at achieving national
          reunification, including its emerging Ostpolitik; 3) U.S. efforts to secure a larger
          offset payment by the Federal Republic of Germany to cover the costs of maintaining U.S.
          forces in Europe; 4) the desire of the United States to secure West German support for a
          Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty; 5) U.S.-French differences over policy toward Germany;
          and 6) the development of policy toward the Berlin question.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Editorial Methodology</p>
                <p>The documents are presented chronologically according to Washington time or, in the case
          of conferences, in the order of individual meetings. Memoranda of conversation are placed
          according to the time and date of the conversation, rather than the date the memorandum
          was drafted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
            Relations</hi> series follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by guidance from the
          General Editor and the chief technical editor. The source text is reproduced as exactly as
          possible, including marginalia or other notations, which are described in the footnotes.
          Texts are transcribed and printed according to accepted conventions for the publication of
          historical documents in the limitations of modern typography. A heading has been supplied
          by the editors for each document included in the volume. Spelling, capitalization, and
          punctuation are retained as found in the source text, except that obvious typographical
          errors are silently corrected. Other mistakes and omissions in the source text are
          corrected by bracketed insertions: a correction is set in italic type; an addition in
          roman type. Words or phrases underlined in the source text are printed in <pb n="VII" xml:id="pg_VII" facs="0007"/>italics. Abbreviations and contractions are preserved as
          found in the source text, and a list of abbreviations is included in the front matter of
          each volume.</p>
                <p>Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate omitted text that deals with an unrelated
          subject (in roman type) or that remains classified after declassification review (in
          italic type). The amount of material not declassified has been noted by indicating the
          number of lines or pages of source text that were omitted. Entire documents withheld for
          declassification purposes have been accounted for and are listed by headings, source
          notes, and number of pages not declassified in their chronological place. The amount of
          material omitted from this volume because it was unrelated to the subject of the volume,
          however, has not been delineated. All brackets that appear in the source text are so
          identified by footnotes.</p>
                <p>The first footnote to each document indicates the document's source, original
          classification, distribution, and drafting information. This note also provides the
          background of important documents and policies and indicates whether the President or his
          major policy advisers read the document. Every effort has been made to determine if a
          document has been previously published, and, if so, this information has been included in
          the source footnote.</p>
                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not printed in the
          volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources, provide references to
          important related documents printed in other volumes, describe key events, and provide
          summaries of and citations to public statements that supplement and elucidate the printed
          documents. Information derived from memoirs and other first-hand accounts has been used
          when appropriate to supplement or explicate the official record.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation</p>
                <p>The Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation, established under the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute, reviews records, advises, and makes
          recommendations concerning the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The
          Advisory Committee monitors the overall compilation and editorial process of the series
          and advises on all aspects of the preparation and declassification of the series. Although
          the Advisory Committee does not attempt to review the contents of individual volumes in
          the series, it does monitor the overall process and makes recommendations on particular
          problems that come to its attention.</p>
                <p>The Advisory Committee has not reviewed this volume.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Declassification Review</p>
                <p>The final declassification review of this volume, which began in 1996 and was completed
          in 1998, resulted in the decision to withhold <pb n="VIII" xml:id="pg_VIII" facs="0008"/>about 1.5 percent of the documentation selected. Three lengthy documents containing
          political analysis were denied in full. Despite these omissions, the documentation
          presented here provides what the editor is confident is an accurate account of U.S. policy
          toward the Federal Republic of Germany and the Berlin question during the 1964–1968
          period.</p>
                <p>The Information Response Branch of the Office of IRM Programs and Services, Bureau of
          Administration, Department of State, conducted the declassification review of the
          documents published in this volume. The review was conducted in accordance with the
          standards set forth in Executive Order 12958 on Classified National Security Information
          and applicable laws.</p>
                <p>Under Executive Order 12958, specific information may be exempt from automatic
          declassification after 25 years if its release could be expected to:</p>
                <p>1) reveal the identity of a confidential human source, or reveal information about the
          application of an intelligence source or method, or reveal the identity of a human
          intelligence source when the unauthorized disclosure of that source would clearly and
          demonstrably damage the national security interests of the United States;</p>
                <p>2) reveal information that would assist in the development or use of weapons of mass
          destruction;</p>
                <p>3) reveal information that would impair U.S. cryptologic systems or activities;</p>
                <p>4) reveal information that would impair the application of state of the art technology
          within the U.S. weapon system;</p>
                <p>5) reveal actual U.S. military war plans that remain in effect;</p>
                <p>6) reveal information that would seriously and demonstrably impair relations between the
          United States and a foreign government, or seriously and demonstrably undermine ongoing
          diplomatic activities of the United States;</p>
                <p>7) reveal information that would clearly and demonstrably impair the current ability of
          U.S. Government officials to protect the President, Vice President, and other officials
          for whom protection services, in the interest of national security, are authorized;</p>
                <p>8) reveal information that would seriously and demonstrably impair current national
          security emergency preparedness plans; or</p>
                <p>9) violate a statute, treaty, or international agreement.</p>
                <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information, subject only
          to the current requirements of national security as embodied in law and regulation.
          Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the appropriate geographic and

                <p>The editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series have complete access
          to all the retired records and papers of the Department of State: the central files of the
          Department; the special decentralized files (“lot files”) of the Department at
          the bureau, office, and division levels; the files of the Department's Executive
          Secretariat, which contain the records of international conferences and high-level
          official visits, correspondence with foreign leaders by the President and Secretary of
          State, and memoranda of conversations between the President and Secretary of State and
          foreign officials; and the files of overseas diplomatic posts. When this volume was being
          compiled, the Department of State records consulted were still under the custody of the
          Department, and the footnotes citing Department of State files suggest that the Department
          is the repository. By the time of publication, however, all the Department's indexed
          central files for these years had been permanently transferred to the National Archives
          and Records Administration (Archives II) at College Park, Maryland. Many of the
          Department's decentralized office (or lot) files covering this period, which the National
          Archives deems worthy of permanent retention, are in the process of being transferred from
          the Department's custody to Archives II.</p>
                <p>The editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series also have full access
          to the papers of President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and other White
          House foreign policy records. Presidential papers maintained and preserved at the
          Presidential libraries include some of the most significant foreign affairs-related
          documentation from the Department of State and other Federal agencies including the
          National Security Council, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of Defense, and
          the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>
                <p>In preparing this volume, the editor made extensive use of Presidential papers and other
          White House records at the <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName>
          Library. Numerous White House memoranda, including memoranda to the President, testify to
          President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s concern with issues relating to
          the Federal Republic of Germany, especially the maintenance of personal ties with
          successive German Chancellors. The bulk of the foreign policy records at the <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> Library are in the country files and other
          component parts of the National Security File.</p>
                <p>The Department of State arranged for access to the many audiotapes <pb n="XVI" xml:id="pg_XVI" facs="0016"/>of President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s telephone conversations that are held at the <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> Library. These audiotapes include substantial
          numbers of telephone conversations between President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>,
          Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, the President's
          Special Assistant for National Security Affairs <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">McGeorge
            Bundy</persName>, and key members of Congress. The editor of this volume selected for
          publication two audiotapes of President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s
          telephone conversations dealing with Germany. Transcripts were then prepared. Although the
          transcripts give the substance of the conversations, readers are urged to consult the
          recordings for a full appreciation of those dimensions that cannot be captured fully in a
          transcription, such as the speakers' inflections and emphases that may convey nuances of
          meaning.</p>
                <p>Second in importance only to the White House records at the <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> Library were the records of the Department of State. The
          Department's central files contain the cable traffic recording U.S. diplomatic relations
          with the Federal Republic of Germany, memoranda of diplomatic conversations, and memoranda
          proposing action or providing information. Some important documents are found only in the
          Department's lot files. The Conference Files maintained by the Executive Secretariat
          contain briefing materials as well as records of conversations. Documentation on
          initiatives that were not approved is often found only in desk or bureau files. The Rusk
          Files contain records of Secretary Rusk's telephone conversations.</p>
                <p>The Central Intelligence Agency provides access to Department of State historians to
          high-level intelligence documents from those records in the custody of that Agency and at
          the Presidential libraries. This access is arranged and facilitated by the History Staff
          of the Center for the Study of Intelligence, Central Intelligence Agency, pursuant to a
          May 1992 memorandum of understanding. Department of State and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> historians continue to work out the procedural and scholarly aspects of
          identifying the key portions of the intelligence record.</p>
                <p>The editor included a selection of intelligence estimates and analyses seen by high-level
          policymakers, especially those that were sent to President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>. Among the intelligence records reviewed for the volume were files
          of the Directors of Central Intelligence, especially <persName>John McCone</persName>,
            <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> intelligence reports and summaries, retired files of
          the Department of State's Bureau of Intelligence and Research containing National
          Intelligence Estimates, and the <gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss> Historical Files.</p>
                <p>Almost all of this documentation has been made available for use in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series thanks to the consent of the agencies mentioned, the
          assistance of their staffs, and especially the cooperation and support of the National
          Archives and Records Administration.</p>
                <p>The following list identifies the particular files and collections used in the
          preparation of this volume. The declassification and transfer to the National Archives of
          these records is in process. Many of the records are already available for public review
          at the National Archives. The declassification review of other records is going forward in
          accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 12958, under which all records over 25
          years old, except file series exemptions requested by agencies and approved by the
          President, should be reviewed for declassification by 2000.</p>

                <p>Since 1861, the Department of State's documentary series Foreign Relations of the United
          States has constituted the official record of the foreign policy and diplomacy of the
          United States. Historians in the Office of the Historian collect, arrange, and annotate
          the principal documents comprising the record of American foreign policy. The standards
          for the preparation of the series and the general deadlines for its publication are
          established by the Foreign Relations of the United States statute of October 28, 1991 (22
          USC 4351, et seq.). Volumes in the Foreign Relations series are published when all the
          necessary editing, declassification, and printing steps have been completed.</p>
                <p>The documents in this volume are drawn from the centralized indexed files of the
          Department of State and the decentralized Bureau, Office, and other lot files of the
          relevant Departmental units. The volume also includes records from the Department of
          Defense and the Central Intelligence Agency. In addition, the editor made extensive use of
          the Presidential and other papers at the <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B.

                <p>Almost all of the documents printed here were originally classified. The Information
          Response Branch of the Office of IRM Programs and Services, Bureau of Administration,
          Department of State, in concert with the appropriate offices in other agencies or

                    <hi rend="strong">Summary</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Between 1964 and 1968, the <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> administration
          was a participant in the process that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">George C.
            McGhee</persName> called the creation of a new Germany. In the field of foreign affairs,
          Germany adopted a more activist and more European policy and searched for a new
          relationship with the Soviet Union and the states of Eastern Europe that would lay the
          groundwork for eventual reunification. In supporting this new German policy, the United
          States reinforced some of its own major policy objectives, including improving relations
          with the Soviet Union, “bridge building” to the East, a reduction of tensions over Berlin,
          continued European integration, and the reorganization of Western defenses.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="strong">Reduction of Tensions Over Berlin and German Reunification</hi>
                </p>
                <p>The key to Germany's new activism in foreign affairs was the decline of East-West
          tensions over Berlin. The Christmas 1963 accord that permitted family visits across the
          divided city signaled a reduction in the level of confrontation. While pleased with this
          development, the United States and its allies remained very concerned about future Soviet
          and East German actions. (1, 4) Sensing an opportunity where its allies saw none, the
          government of Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Ludwig Erhard</persName> proposed
          in mid-January 1964 that the Western powers launch an initiative with the Soviets to lay
          the basis for eventual reunification of Germany. (2)</p>
                <p>Germany's proposal met with great skepticism on the part of its major Allies. (3, 5–7,
          9–10, 14) Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Dean Rusk</persName> commented
          that the proposal “did not have enough meat in it. It would risk “waking sleeping dogs”
          and stimulating the Soviets.” (13) Another major inhibiting factor from Washington's
          perspective was two incidents in which U.S. aircraft that strayed into East German air
          space were shot down. Each incident had the potential to ratchet up tensions between East
          and West. (8, 19, 27) Nevertheless, under insistent German prodding (11–19), the Allies
          sought to find a way to meet German desires, strengthen the proposal, and time it to
          correspond to a more evident Soviet readiness to talk. (26–30)</p>
                <p>U.S. desire to win German support for a number of important policy initiatives, including
          its international economic projects, influenced its readiness to accommodate the German
          Government. (15, 22, 24) As part of U.S. diplomacy toward Germany, President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> attempted to improve the already warm personal
          relations he enjoyed with Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>. In
          personal messages, the President kept the German leader informed of overall U.S. policy
          and U.S. dealings with the Soviet Union on German-related matters. (15, 32)</p>
                <p>The reunification initiative remained key to meeting German desires. The Allies, however,
          were still unable to agree on an approach. At the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
          Foreign Ministers meeting at The Hague in May 1964, the Allies disagreed on the timing of
          such an initiative but managed to reach accord on a public position. (37)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="strong">High-Level Meetings in Washington</hi>
                </p>
                <p>The onset of electoral maneuvering in Germany intensified pressures for a reunification
          initiative. In May, West Berlin Mayor Willy Brandt, the opposition Social Democratic Party
          leader, visited Washington. Brandt's visit was both a campaign kick-off and the
          opportunity to exchange views that U.S. leaders took very seriously. (39–41)</p>
                <p>Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> followed Brandt to Washington
          within a month. Again U.S. preparations for the meeting were intense. (42, 45) In meetings
          with the President and other senior U.S. officials, the German delegation discussed plans
          for new initiatives in Eastern Europe, reunification projects, trade, and Soviet
          positions. (46–55) In a meeting with Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, Erhard reviewed differences over the level of German “offset”
          payments designed to reduce the burden on the United States of stationing U.S. troops in
          the Federal Republic of Germany. (53)</p>
                <p>The Washington meetings strengthened German-U.S. cooperation. American officials
          continued their efforts to craft a policy that would support a German reunification
          initiative. (57) Senior officials discussed and endorsed German initiatives to improve
          relations with the Soviet Union. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName>
          and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> agreed that these moves
          reinforced the U.S. “bridge building” policy. (63, 65)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="strong">Emergence of Ostpolitik</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Willy Brandt</persName> was among those urging greater
          attention to improved German ties with the East. In late August 1964, he forwarded a
          memorandum outlining his ideas for an “Ostpolitik” initiative. (67) <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> gave a favorable estimate of the emergence of a
          more constructive German East European policy. (71) The Ambassador, however, remained
          concerned about possible flare-ups of tension over Berlin, urging the U.S. military to
          avoid actions that might fuel a confrontation. (68, 70, 92) He moved to restrain former
          Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Konrad Adenauer</persName>, another potential
          barrier to better relations with the Eastern states. (72)</p>
                <p>The December 1964 <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Foreign Ministers meeting at
          Paris provided another opportunity to review the state of German plans for a reunification
          initiative. (74–76) <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName> of the Policy
          Planning Council suggested a scenario for meeting German desires (81), while Ambassador
            <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> pressed Washington on the need for
          meeting Germany's request. (83) Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>
          outlined U.S. concerns for <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName>. (84) Continuing
          German pressure on the issue (79, 80, 85) produced a blunt January 1965 response from an
          irritated President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> who stated that he had
          done his best to meet German requirements and saw no justification for any German “crisis
          of confidence” in U.S. policy. (86)</p>
                <p>
                    <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName>, an experienced diplomat, soothed his
          superiors while moving the discussion forward toward a common ground between U.S. and
          German approaches to reunification. (87–89) In a February 1965 meeting with President
            <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>, German Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Heinrich Knappstein</persName> further smoothed out disagreements.

                </p>
                <p>Discussions of German policy took place against a background of deepening disagreements
          between the United States and France over a wide range of policy issues. French efforts to
          reduce both U.S. involvement in European affairs and its ties to Germany displeased
          Washington. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> bluntly told French
          leaders that the United States would continue its role as an “essential participant in all
          matters affecting German reunification and Berlin.” (11, 95, 96)</p>
                <p>U.S.-French disagreements over German policy were the cause of the Allies' failure to
          issue an agreed policy statement on German reunification in the Spring of 1965. (99,
          102–106) After the French blocked a coordinated statement, the Western states made
          separate declarations to mark the May 8 anniversary of the founding of the Federal
          Republic. (107, 109–110)</p>

            Washington</hi>
                </p>
                <p>In June 1965, with German elections approaching, Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> again visited Washington. Germany's ongoing problems with a Gaullist
          France dominated discussions. (112, 114–118)</p>
                <p>Shortly after the <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> visit, a new clash over
          West German rights in Berlin led to a policy review in Washington and discussions with
          Bonn about the best manner to confront East German harassment of West German officials.
          (119–123, 125–126) The rise of tension over Berlin, in turn, refocused attention on the
          nature of U.S. and Allied efforts to advance German reunification. (124–125, 130, 132,
          133) The Allies discussed German policy at the December 1965 Paris meeting of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Foreign Ministers. (134–136)</p>
                <p>Another visit by Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> to Washington
          in December 1965 gave U.S. officials the opportunity to try to expand German support for
          the <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> administration's top foreign policy
          priority, Vietnam. (138, 143)</p>
                <p>In 1966 <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Willy Brandt</persName> emerged as a more active
          proponent of a new policy approach to East Germany. As a first stage, he expanded and
          intensified his contacts with Soviet representatives in Berlin. (147) <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> administration policymakers were generally
          favorable to a policy that would reduce Cold War barriers between the two Germanies. The
          impact of these initiatives was discussed at <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>'s June
          1966 Brussels meeting. (148)</p>

                    <hi rend="strong">Deadlock on the Offset Issue</hi>
                </p>
                <p>After the Brussels meeting, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> visited
          Bonn for wide-ranging talks that confirmed agreement on most issues. The essentially
          smooth relationship between the <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and
            <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> governments ran into serious turbulence
          over the issue of offset payments. (149–150) Washington was then incensed when <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> in a subsequent press conference gave his
          explanation of Germany's position on this issue. (153) Both the President and the
          Chancellor acted to calm ruffled feathers (154, 155), and <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> offered an assessment of the sources of disagreement between the two
          allies. (156)</p>
                <p>The deadlock on offset between the two sides continued, and <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> expressed concern about its ultimate impact. (160–161) President
            <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> continued to press U.S. views. (162) In
          September, with his political future menaced by domestic developments, Chancellor
            <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> again traveled to the United States,
          seeking to play the “American card” in the form of a successful meeting with the
          President. (167–168, 170)</p>
                <p>
                    <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s September 25–29 visit to Washington
          failed to gain his objectives. The two nations remained divided on the offset question,
          and U.S. officials continued to seek a greater German involvement in support of the
          Vietnam war effort. Only discussions on German-Soviet rapprochement achieved a full
          accord. (172–180) In the end the two leaders turned to the drafting of a press communiqué
          to put the best face on their meeting. (179)</p>

                </p>
                <p>Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> fell in October 1966, and was
          succeeded by a government of “grand coalition” comprising the Christian Democratic
          Union/Christian Social Union and the Social Democrats. <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kurt
            Georg Kiesinger</persName> (<gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>) became Chancellor and
            <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Willy Brandt</persName> became Vice Chancellor and Foreign
          Minister.</p>
                <p>Even prior to assuming his new position, Brandt had gained the interest and appreciation
          of U.S. officials through his continuing discussions with Soviet representatives on ways
          to improve East-West relations. (183) <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName>'s
          initial meeting with Foreign Minister Brandt focused on policy planning and on differences
          that had arisen over elements of Berlin policy. (188) <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> analyzed the outlook for Ostpolitik in December 1966. (190) Brandt
          presented his views to the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Foreign Ministers meeting
          that same month. (191)</p>

                <p>The emergence of new leadership in Germany gave impetus to one of <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName>'s major policy goals, a Presidential visit to the
          Federal Republic. Erhard had repeatedly signaled his desire for such a visit, but
          President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>, while agreeable in principle,
          failed to schedule the trip. <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> pressed for a
          visit to solidify relations with the new German leaders, but the President declined to
          commit to a trip. (192) Meanwhile, Kiesinger held his meeting with French President
            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">Charles de Gaulle</persName>. Analyzing the results of the
          encounter, Rostow commented with satisfaction that “Bonn's heart still belongs to Daddy.”
          (195)</p>
                <p>Foreign Minister Brandt arrived in Washington in February 1967 for talks. In addition to
          East-West relations, U.S. desire to win German approval for a multilateral Nuclear
          Non-Proliferation Treaty (<gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>) dominated the agenda.
          (199)</p>
                <p>In March the <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> administration moved to
          develop more personal contacts with the German leaders. Vice President <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName> visited Bonn for talks. (206, 208) The
          long-awaited Presidential visit followed a few weeks later when President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> arrived for the funeral of <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Konrad Adenauer</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s talks with Kiesinger April 23–26 covered the entire range of
          bilateral and multilateral issues before the two states. They established a good personal
          relationship. (212–214)</p>
                <p>The settlement of differences over an offset agreement in the fall of 1967 reinforced the
          relationship. The United States had turned to former High Commissioner for Germany
            <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">John McCloy</persName> to secure an agreement. (223)
          Kiesinger meanwhile visited Washington for talks August 14–16 that included discussion of
          offset but centered on the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> issues. (224–228)</p>

                <p>During the first half of 1968, Ostpolitik, the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>,
          differences with France over policy toward Germany, and concerns about possible Soviet
          moves against Allied rights in Berlin dominated the <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> administration's agenda. (207–211, 213–218) German sensitivity about
          U.S. views of <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> policy reappeared, and <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> administration officials sought to reassure the
          Germans. (253, 255, 256) <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName>, in a final
          assessment, concluded that the relationship was working well. (258)</p>
                <p>In June new difficulties arose in Berlin, sparked by East German desire to limit West
          German access rights. (259–277) Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> met
          three times with senior Soviet representatives to impress them with U.S. determination to
          guarantee Allied rights in Berlin. (261, 270, 277) U.S. policy toward Germany and Berlin
          was refined at senior levels of the government, including the National Security Council.

                <p>Discussions within the Alliance over Berlin and German policy were well-advanced
          (278–282) when the Czech crisis exploded in August 1968. German and U.S. officials agreed
          on the need for a tough line with the Soviets not only to show disapproval for military
          intervention in Czechoslovakia but also to warn the Soviet Union about the dangers of
          trying to increase pressures on Berlin. (287–289, 291–295) As the <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> administration left office, Soviet policy on the
          German and Berlin issues remained a troubling issue.</p>

                    <p rend="center">(Official German translation)</p>
                    <p>Recognizing that continuance of the division of Germany will lead to continued tension
            and insecurity in Europe, the government of the Federal Republic of Germany deems it
            necessary to submit new proposals for the solution of the problem of Germany. It bases
            its proposals on the assumption</p>
                    <p>—that the safeguarding of peace and security is today more than ever a vital problem
            for all nations,</p>
                    <p>—that peace and security in Europe will remain in danger as long as the German nation
            is denied self-determination,</p>
                    <p>—that the right of self-determination constitutes a legal, political and moral
            principle which is indivisible and therefore must find application everywhere,</p>
                    <p>—that the people in all parts of Germany feel that they are members of one nation
            wanting to live in one state,</p>
                    <p>—that the Germans on the other side of the wall and of the demarcation line are unable
            to manifest their own will freely and without hindrance, and</p>
                    <p>—that the age of colonialism is coming to an end and should not be replaced by any new
            form of colonialism.</p>
                    <p>In taking this new initiative the Federal Government bears in mind that the Basic Law
            for the Federal Republic of Germany<note n="2" xml:id="d2fn2">For text of the Basic Law,
              approved May 8, 1949, see Documents on Germany, 1944–1985, pp. 221–258.</note> and the
            moral responsibility of free men make it incumbent on the people of free Germany to work
            also for the freedom of those of their fellow-citizens to whom such freedom is denied.
            The Federal Government therefore proposes a settlement of the German problem based on
            the following principles.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. Transitional settlement</p>
                    <p>The intricate nature of the German problem requires agreement on a transitional
            settlement which aims at restoring German unity in freedom. <pb n="3" xml:id="pg_3" facs="0033"/>Such transitional settlements are nothing new. Transitional settlements
            in 1955 and 1956 enabled a settlement of the Saar problem which conformed to the
            interests of all concerned.<note n="3" xml:id="d2fn3">For text of the agreement
              respecting the status of the Saar, signed by the Federal Republic of Germany and
              France, October 27, 1956, see ibid., p. 494.</note> Similar to the procedure adopted
            for the settlement of the Saar problem, an attempt should be made to agree upon fixed
            dates for the duration of a transitional period and for an ultimate referendum on the
            procedure of reunification in the whole of Germany.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Establishment of a Permanent Council of the Four Powers</p>
                    <p>Under international law particular responsibility for Germany as a whole has fallen to
            the Four Powers. The continued existence of that legal responsibility finds, as is
            known, its visible expression in political institutions and contacts of the Four Powers.
            In the interest of a lasting peace in Europe, a Permanent Council of the Four Powers
            should be set up for Germany on the basis of experience gathered by the Four Powers
            while working out a State Treaty for Austria. Amongst other duties and responsibilities
            such a Council would have to</p>
                    <p>(a) fix the time-schedule for the transitional period and the date for the ultimate
            referendum in the whole of Germany,</p>
                    <p>(b) work out a plan that would guarantee reunification and European security,</p>
                    <p>(c) prepare, in cooperation with German agencies, an electoral law for the holding of
            all-German elections which, for practical purposes, should be along the lines of the
            German electoral law of 1924,</p>
                    <p>(d) supervise the implementation of these and any additional arrangements,</p>
                    <p>(e) pending the conclusion of a peace treaty, settle any differences of opinion arising
            among the Four Powers during the implementation of such arrangements.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. Referendum</p>
                    <p>The plan worked out by the Four Powers for the implementation of reunification and the
            electoral law will be referred to the German people to vote upon. The referendum may
            take place in all of Germany as one single electoral district, or separately on both
            sides of the wall and the zonal border under international supervision, not excluding
            that of the United Nations. The following is stipulated for the preparation and
            implementation of the referendum:</p>
                    <p>—all political parties admitted in either part of Germany may become active in all
            parts of Germany,</p>
                    <p>—press, broadcasting and television services may become active in all parts of Germany
            without restriction,</p>
                    <pb n="4" xml:id="pg_4" facs="0034"/>
                    <p>—in no part of Germany must individuals or families be prejudiced because of their
            membership [in] a political party or organization or of an administration.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">4. Humanitarian commissions</p>
                    <p>For reasons of humanity and notwithstanding any political aspects, humanitarian
            commissions should be set up immediately under the auspices of the Four Powers. Such
            mixed commissions should be assigned the duty immediately to ease the lot of Germans
            suffering from the division. This includes in particular the facilitation of personal
            contacts:</p>
                    <p>—families must no longer remain separated,</p>
                    <p>—members of the same churches or the same communities must not be hindered in the free
            practising of their religion or in participating in ecclesiastic
            self-administration,</p>
                    <p>—everybody must have the right to visit and maintain the graves of his next-of-kin,</p>
                    <p>—free contacts must be guaranteed in the cultural and vocational spheres and in the
            domain of sports.</p>
                    <p>Anyone wanting reunification will first of all call for milder conditions for the
            people suffering from the division. Any truly humanitarian policy will refrain from
            securing political advantages in talks on humanitarian questions. The Federal Government
            will do its utmost to facilitate the coming into existence of such humanitarian
            commissions.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">5. Amnesty</p>
                    <p>A general political amnesty, in particular an amnesty for all those detained for
            attempted escape, for aiding refugees, or for offences or resistance against the
            political order in either part of Germany, is a dictate of humanity. When the time has
            come, the Federal Government will for its own sphere of jurisdiction propose to the
            legislative bodies that such an amnesty be proclaimed.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">6. Extension of economic relations inside Germany</p>
                    <p>Once a minimum of human rights is guaranteed for the whole of Germany, the Federal
            Government, being conscious of its responsibility towards all Germans, will be prepared
            to make concrete economic contributions. This includes the granting of credits in
            interzonal trade, the extension of clearing time-limits, and other measures.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">7. Friendship with East European nations</p>
                    <p>The Federal Government, which endeavours to strengthen the confidence between Germany
            and all other nations in the world, also seeks to establish good neighbourly and
            friendly relations between the German people as a whole and the peoples of East Europe.
            A peace conference, at which the problem of the German-Polish border will have to be
            clarified and a just decision on the German regions on the other side of <pb n="5" xml:id="pg_5" facs="0035"/>the Oder and Neisse freely agreed upon,<note n="4" xml:id="d2fn4">For text of the Potsdam Accords relating to the status of Germany's
              border with Poland, see ibid., p. 63.</note> should be preceded by an improvement of
            the human, economic and political relations between the German people and its
            neighbouring nations in the East. Improvement of those relations must be possible. There
            have been examples of this in the recent past, such as the reconciliation between the
            German people and its neighbours in the West, particularly the French people. Now that
            Franco-German friendship has become an established fact, it should be possible, by means
            of a binding renunciation of the use of force and through recognition of the right of
            self-determination and domicile for all nations, to place the relations between the
            German people and the East European nations, too, on a new foundation.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">8. European security</p>
                    <p>The Federal Government knows that there can be no constructive policy with regard to
            Germany without clarification of the existing European and Atlantic security problems.
            The restoration of German unity and the safeguarding of security for all countries and
            groups of countries concerned with the German problem are closely interrelated. The
            union of the Germans in secure freedom should not shift the balance nor impair the
            security of other European nations.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">9. Disarmament</p>
                    <p>In connexion with the settlement of the German problem the Federal Government is
            prepared to do anything conducive to reducing conflicting elements, to overcoming
            tensions and to achieving internationally controlled disarmament. The overcoming of
            tensions includes the elimination of their causes one of which—and not the smallest
            one—is the division of Germany.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">10. Peace</p>
                    <p>For Germany, reunification is not a means to strengthen her national power. After being
            reunified, Germany will use all her strength to render, within the family of nations, an
            increased contribution towards safeguarding peace and raising the prosperity of all
            nations.</p>

                    <p>The Germans finally tabled their heralded peace plan.<note n="2" xml:id="d3fn2">
                            <ref target="#d2">Document 2</ref>.</note> As you will see from a copy I have
            attached, it is really a “non-plan.” It deals with German reunification but has nothing
            in it of possible interest to the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>The understanding at yesterday's meeting was that the Ambassadorial Group would
            reassemble early next week to discuss the proposals. (Knappstein said he couldn't handle
            questions at this meeting.)</p>
                    <p>My suggestion to <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> and our Germans was
            that Knappstein should be asked at the next meeting how he would make this proposal more
            salable to the Soviets, and that a working group be given the job to convert this
            non-starter into a negotiable package.</p>
                    <p>On the U.S. side, we have been working with some ideas (including Adenauer's standstill
            proposal, the Pell and Mansfield plans),<note n="3" xml:id="d3fn3">For extracts of the
              relevant portions of Adenauer's May 5, 1962, standstill proposal, see American Foreign
              Policy: Current Documents, 1962, pp. 698–700. In December 1963, Senator Pell suggested
              that the Western powers exchange recognition of the German Democratic Republic for
              guarantees of free passage to Berlin. Senator Mansfield had, on a number of occasions,
              most recently in August 1962, suggested that recognition of the East German regime
              could lead to a settlement of the Berlin question.</note> and I think we probably can
            re-fashion this German widget into something more negotiable. However, there is a clear
            tactical advantage in keeping the project a German initiative—if only to keep the French
            involved and the Germans on board.</p>
                    <p>Unless major scenario changes are ordered by the 7th floor, this operation will get
            under way early next week—the object being to produce a useful plan in the shortest
            possible time.</p>
                    <p>If nothing else, this will insure that some of us will be working while you all are
            sunning yourselves in the far south.<note n="4" xml:id="d3fn4">A handwritten notation by

                    <p>1. Embassy is pouching to addressees on January 20 an airgram analyzing political
            significance of Berlin pass arrangement in West Germany.<note n="2" xml:id="d4fn2">Airgram A–1185 from Bonn, January 20. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss>
              23–10 <gloss target="#t_GER1">GER</gloss>)</note> Assessments of local reactions
            provided by Consulates have been taken into account. Following are main conclusions
            reached:</p>
                    <p>A. Public reaction—while West German press has tended to highlight dangers involved in
            Christmas pass protocol, public generally has been favorably impressed by humanitarian
            achievement and considers that pass arrangement was a gain for the Western side. There
            is awareness that caution is required in dealing with East Germans but idea of contacts
            with them is not rejected per se. Public identifies Brandt with pass arrangement and he
            appears to have gained somewhat in popularity as result.</p>
                    <p>B. Position of political parties—The <gloss target="#t_FDP1">FDP</gloss> is the most
            enthusiastic and unequivocal of three parties in its support for pass agreement and for
            continuation of such contacts. In spite of doubts in the party executive, the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> has also endorsed the arrangement and will support
            further efforts to reach agreement with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> along
            lines of Dec. 17 protocol. The <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_CSU1">CSU</gloss> is in basically defensive position since most of its
            leaders have serious reservations about pass negotiations and are fearful that <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>'s German policy has already been jeopardized. They are
            prevented from attacking agreement and present efforts to extend it because Erhard has
            concurred in them and public opinion favors them. <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_CSU1">CSU</gloss> can therefore be expected to go along
            with continuation Korber-Wendt talks but to oppose any elevation of level of contact or
            the establishment of further channels of negotiations with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, except under quadripartite auspices.</p>
                    <p>C. Government's policy—The immediate <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> objective is
            to maintain and extend such gains as the Western side achieved in the pass arrangement
            while minimizing the price paid. It will make every effort to counter any impression
            that <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> policy has changed and can be expected to
            reinforce the competence of the <gloss target="#t_IZT1">IZT</gloss> Treuhandstelle and
            to oppose higher level contacts with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> will cooperate with the Allies in maintaining a fairly
            stable situation in which both can handle <pb n="8" xml:id="pg_8" facs="0038"/>Berlin
            matters in accordance with their varying interpretations of the city's status. The
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> does not view Berlin pass arrangement as bringing
            reunification any closer but it does not rule out the possibility that an amelioration
            of conditions in Berlin and the Soviet Zone might at some point be achieved by dealings
            with East German representatives and the extension of West German credits. It will move
            extremely cautiously to avoid unwarranted jeopardy to its present German policy, but it
            will do what it can to encourage a political relaxation in East Germany.</p>
                    <p>2. Subsequent messages will be submitted on the implications of the pass issue for US
            policy and the motivation and tactics of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. The
            latter will first be coordinated with <gloss target="#t_USBER1">USBER</gloss>.<note n="3" xml:id="d4fn3">Not further identified.</note>

            return to Bonn. My reflections have understandably focused on the German problem, which
            remains the principal obstacle to any lasting Central European settlement.</p>
                    <p>It seems clear that the German proposal just tabled in the Ambassadorial Group is a
              non-starter,<note n="4" xml:id="d5fn4">
                            <ref target="#d2">Document 2</ref>. The Embassy provided its analysis of the proposal
              in telegram 2513 from Bonn, January 17. (Department of State, Central Files, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 32–4 <gloss target="#t_GER1">GER</gloss>)</note>
            intended essentially for domestic political <pb n="9" xml:id="pg_9" facs="0039"/>purposes. Negotiations with the Soviets on partial aspects of disarmament, or aimed at
            limited relaxation of tensions, are but way stations toward the goal we seek. I have,
            accordingly, been giving thought as to whether some really new approach to a settlement
            is not possible.</p>
                    <p>The odds of success of any overall approach to the basic conflict between the West and
            the Soviets are undoubtedly slight. However the reward could be correspondingly great. I
            would, therefore, like to offer for your consideration the following analysis and
            proposal. While admittedly a long shot, its possibilities are believed to be enhanced by
            the present conjunction of three independent but supporting circumstances:</p>
                    <p>(A) Present Soviet economic weakness;</p>
                    <p>(B) Pressure in the West to exploit the Soviet market;</p>
                    <p>(C) Possible German willingness to make financial sacrifices for reunification.</p>
                    <p>2. I will deal with each in turn:</p>
                    <p>(A) Soviet economic weakness: The <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> report on the
            state of the Soviet economy<note n="5" xml:id="d5fn5">Reference is to <gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss> 11–5–64, “Soviet Economic Problems and Outlook,”
              January 8, 1964, scheduled for publication in <ref target="frus1964-68v14">

                <gloss target="#t_NARA1">NARA</gloss>, RG 263, National Intelligence
              Estimates.</note> seems to indicate a far greater degree of structural weakness,
            particularly in agriculture, than we have heretofore suspected. The effect of this
            weakness on Soviet policy is obviously accentuated by their current difficulties with
            Communist China. We are in no position here fully to evaluate the significance of
            current Soviet economic difficulties. Moscow 2221 indicates, however, that the policy
            implications may be “profound.” Even a partial revision of Soviet economic philosophy
            could entail political changes—including revision of their doctrine on relations with
            the capitalist states. This could hardly take place overnight, but might over a period
            of a decade or more. I would suggest that a National Intelligence Estimate be prepared,
            with the assistance of Embassy Moscow, assessing the possibilities and probabilities of
            such a change and what we may realistically expect its effects to be, given the existing
            conflict between dogma and fact.<note n="6" xml:id="d5fn6">

                    </p>
                    <p>(B) Western pressure to “exploit” this weakness: The United Kingdom's determination to
            grant long-term credits to the Soviets is symptomatic of commercial restlessness and
            incipient pressure throughout Western Europe to exploit Soviet economic needs. As
            Ambassador Finletter has pointed out (Polto 118),<note n="7" xml:id="d5fn7">Not
              found.</note> the British action may signal the start of an uncoordinated credit race
            among the Western nations for an imagined trade plum. France has already indicated it
            will follow England's <pb n="10" xml:id="pg_10" facs="0040"/>lead. Chancellor Erhard has
            indicated to me that, were this to happen, he would find it very difficult to restrain
            German industry (Embtel 2383).<note n="8" xml:id="d5fn8">Dated January 8. (Department of
              State, Central Files, FIN 11–1 COMBLOC–<gloss target="#t_GER1">GER</gloss>)</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>(C) German payment for reunification: I consider the fact that Chancellor Erhard raised
            with the President in their private meeting his idea of granting economic assistance to
            the Soviets as a means towards reunification,<note n="9" xml:id="d5fn9">See <ref target="frus1961-63v15#d250">
                                <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1961–1963, vol. XV, Document
              250</ref>.</note> which he had expressed to us before very cautiously, as probably the
            one most significant feature of the Texas talks. The Chancellor obviously continues to
            be bemused with the hope that he can “buy” a solution to the German problem [garble]
            through some further economic “sacrifice” by the German people. He keeps returning to it
            despite the domestic political and budgetary difficulties it would involve, and an
            agreed policy with us against the extension of long-term credits to the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>3. Any initiative of the kind envisaged by Erhard could be frustrated from the outset
            if it seemed to be merely a large-scale German involvement in the credit race for
            commercial objectives. Any Western plan for economic assistance to the Soviets must, if
            it is to succeed, be related to the more commercially based desires of the British and
            French, so as to provide a basis for unity rather than competition. I would suggest,
            therefore, that we seriously examine how we can achieve, within the framework of the
            proposal made in this telegram, a unified and broadly based Western position on trade
            and credits to the Soviet Union, including a more positive position for the US than we
            have thus far taken.</p>
                    <p>4. Under the assumption that there is a possibility, over a period of years, to
            influence Soviet readjustment, and that a unified Western position in the economic
            sphere is possible (and I realize what considerable assumptions these are), I propose
            consideration of a plan along the following lines:</p>
                    <p>(A) A unified Western program of grants and credits to the Soviet Union and European
            satellites would be secretly agreed, which would take place over, say, a 10-year time
            period, if certain conditions were met. This program would start out modestly, but might
            reach $5 billion per annum, with a total up to, say, $40 billion. The focus of the plan
            would be on the furnishing of industrial plants for the production of fertilizers,
            synthetic materials and products for consumer use. The Europeans would, basically
            because of the greater incentive of the Germans, be expected to finance the bulk, say 80
            percent of the plan. We would agree to finance the remaining 20 percent. Of the European
            contribution, the German share might be as much as 60 percent, or about 50 percent of
            the total. <pb n="11" xml:id="pg_11" facs="0041"/>State Secretary Westrick has spoken in
            terms of a possible German contribution of this magnitude.</p>
                    <p>(B) Major changes in the status quo have usually seemed to hinge on someone's ability
            and willingness to pay the bill. In the case of the Marshall Plan it was our willingness
            to pay $17 billion. The possible German willingness to pay a large amount is the very
            core of this plan. Much as in the Marshall Plan days, the utilization of these funds
            could be worked out by agreement between the grantors and the recipients. Some mechanism
            similar to the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> might be established to provide the
            framework.</p>
                    <p>(C) The trick, of course, would be to obtain from the Soviets political benefits of a
            magnitude sufficient to justify such an initiative and assure its execution. Experience
            would indicate that the Soviets will not make any formal exchange of political for
            economic benefits. Instead of spelling out concrete desiderata in advance, therefore, I
            would think it preferable to talk initially in terms of a gradual easing of tensions in
            Central Europe, under circumstances which would be tolerable to both Western and Soviet
            security. This would have to include, at least implicitly, an understanding that German
            reunification would occur at some point, on terms acceptable to the West but with some
            concession having been made by the West. There would also have to be some assurance of
            progress on disarmament, since large-scale economic assistance would lessen pressure on
            the Soviets to disarm.</p>
                    <p>(D) This plan could be carried out by a series of reciprocal but unilateral actions,
            not necessarily directly related to each other. Each stage would have to be
            synchronized, to assure that the benefits to the East are in some way compensated by
            comparable benefits to the West. The expectation of German reunification would have to
            become increasingly explicit as the plan was implemented.</p>
                    <p>(E) Economic assistance can be halted at any time. Once the Soviets had made plans
            based on the expected assistance, however, there would be a strong incentive on their
            part to assure its fulfillment. The whole endeavor would be under the continuing control
            of both sides, and could be halted by either at any time if performance were
            unsatisfactory. The plan would not depend upon the element of trust on either side.</p>
                    <p>5. This plan is believed to offer major advantages in achieving a break-through in the
            East-West stalemate. The idea exploits the Soviets' most obvious weakness. It could also
            provide a vehicle by which, over a long period of time, the Germans would have an
            opportunity to demonstrate by their actions that the Soviets' traditional distrust of
            them is no longer well founded. The fact that Germans were in Russia helping to carry
            out the program, and plants for Russia were being built in Germany, would, in a sense,
            provide the Russians with some assurance of Germany's peaceful intentions. Finally, it
            might provide a framework for <pb n="12" xml:id="pg_12" facs="0042"/>Western unity on
            credit and trade policy towards the Soviet Union and satellites—a prospect we do not
            otherwise have. A potential liability could be converted into an asset.</p>
                    <p>6. I am aware too that there are serious disadvantages in a proposal along these lines.
            My telegram 1650 of last November points out, for example, that Erhard may not be able
            to develop support for his plan in the Federal Republic, as well as the adverse
            implications for German defense spending and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
            strategy. There are other questions as well. The German position is still inchoate. The
            Chancellor has been thinking largely in terms of achieving German reunification. It is
            not known how he would react to an organized Western effort in which this objective was
            less clearly defined and guaranteed. We do not know if the Germans would be prepared to
            pay anything like the amounts they have indicated.</p>
                    <p>7. I realize that it is not possible to make any immediate decision on this proposal as
            a whole. We can, however, undertake immediately the two studies I have proposed. I
            believe, moreover, that we could make two moves in low key:</p>
                    <p>(A) I could inquire of Chancellor Erhard whether he had further developed his thinking
            on assistance to the Soviets. Depending on his answer, I could inquire further whether
            he would be agreeable to a discreet United States approach in Moscow suggesting that, if
            the Soviet Union were prepared to consider what action it might take to remove the
            causes of tension in Central Europe, the Western powers, for their part, would be
            prepared to consider a possible major initiative in the trade and credit field;</p>
                    <p>(B) If Erhard were agreeable to this, and after consultations and agreement with the
            British, which should not be difficult, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> could make a discreet approach in Moscow, on a highly tentative
            basis, to test <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>'s reaction.</p>
                    <p>I would appreciate your comments, as well as Foy Kohler's in Moscow.</p>

            interest Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName>'s skillful
            development of Erhard's essentially commercial approach to the problem of German
            reunification. I wish I could agree that the idea were a plausible approach to a
            break-through in East-West relations, but in all honesty, I do not believe it has any
            chance of success. The following are my principal reasons:</p>
                    <p>1. Soviet acceptance of the idea would mean, in effect, bartering major long-range
            political objectives for relatively short-range economic gains. The Soviets have never
            been prepared to engage in this sort of deal with West; witness their rejection of
            Marshall Plan aid (with no political strings attached) at a time when their economic
            needs were much more pressing than they are now and, more importantly, at a time when
            their supremacy in the World Communist Movement was unchallenged. If they were not
            interested then in Western offers of economic assistance, objections now on policy
            grounds would be all the more compelling in the context of their vital competition with
            the ChiComs for leadership. There is little question in my mind that at this stage
            Soviets feel obligated to filter all foreign policy moves through the litmus of their
            quarrel with the Chinese. They are acutely sensitive to ChiCom charges of Soviet
            willingness to sacrifice the objectives of the World Communist Movement for selfish
            national reasons; they feel a compelling need, therefore, to handle their avowed policy
            of coexistence with delicacy and restraint to minimize their vulnerability to ChiCom
            attack. Certainly any such deal with West would be promptly rejected on the basis of
            this test alone.</p>
                    <p>2. Thus, while it is tempting to speculate that aid in meeting current economic
            difficulties might induce the Soviets to accept a radical reorientation of their
            political aims, I think we must dismiss this as a realistic possibility. Perhaps, I
            should assume some of the blame if this speculation has taken root. Embtel 2221,<note n="3" xml:id="d6fn3">See <ref target="#d5fn2">footnote 2, Document 5</ref>.</note>
            however, should not be read as reflecting a considered judgment by this Embassy that
            economic problems will force the Soviets to abandon their major political objectives; in
            this sense, use of “profound” in predicting effects on Soviet policy was perhaps
            ill-advised. The Soviet economic machine is clearly in bad shape. To permit time for
            necessary repairs, to enable Khrushchev to <pb n="14" xml:id="pg_14" facs="0044"/>make
            some progress toward fulfilling his commitments to his own people, and to facilitate the
            possibility of Western assistance, particularly in the form of credits, toward these
            ends, the Soviets will eschew any dangerous adventurism in foreign policy for the
            foreseeable future. But for Western policy makers to go beyond this in predicting the
            impact of current economic difficulties on Soviet policy is certainly neither prudent
            nor realistic.</p>
                    <p>3. Furthermore, <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> must feel fairly
            confident that a break in the Western credit policy is inevitable. Evidence of how far
            the British are prepared to go is available to him as well as to us. He is not likely to
            pay a political price for something he believes to be in the cards. But even without
            what must appear to him to be a fairly reliable prospect of Western help, the Soviets
            know—and we must recognize—that they can in the long run and by their efforts alone, put
            their economy in satisfactory shape. The process will be slower and the machine, when
            repaired, may be creaky and backward by Western standards, but it will probably meet
            Soviet requirements.</p>
                    <p>4. A final word on the German problem, itself. Naturally, I concur in the judgment that
            the key to any real break-through in East-West relations is a lasting Central European
            settlement. Unfortunately, since this depends on Soviet concurrence in a reasonable
            approach to reunification, such a settlement must remain a distant possibility and there
            is little we in the West can do to expedite its achievement. It depends in the final
            analysis either on Soviet willingness to write-off the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> as an economic and political liability or on Soviet confidence that a
            unified Germany will result in an extension rather than curtailment of Soviet influence.
            We in the West cannot force the Soviets to make this decision now; nor can we expect
            them to commit themselves to a policy which pre-judges the outcome. The most we can do,
            it seems to me, is to exploit all available opportunities for influencing the course of
            events and the development of what the Marxists would call “objective conditions” so
            that in the end the Soviets will be confronted with only one choice—permitting the
            German people to decide.</p>
                    <p>In sum, I am bearish now—despite the economic problems facing the Soviets—as I was in
            Bonn last fall on the Erhard-Adenauer approach. I am hopeful that the Soviet Union will
            in the long run become a less troublesome, more responsible performer on the world
            stage, and I think we can influence progress in this direction, or at least the pace
            thereof, by our own policies, including exchange programs, purposeful use of trade to
            obtain indirect political benefits, and restrictions on credit to compel Soviets to face
            up to hard decisions on resource allocations. (Embtel 1653, sent Bonn 114, of November
            14, 1963,<note n="4" xml:id="d6fn4">For text, see <ref target="frus1961-63v15#d241">
                                <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1961–1963, vol. XV, Document
              241</ref>.</note> touched on some of these points.) <pb n="15" xml:id="pg_15" facs="0045"/>At same time, it must be recognized that process of reorienting Soviet
            behavior probably will be more influenced by developments which neither they nor we can
            control, such as restiveness in Eastern European countries, growing conflict with China,
            and demands of Soviet people for a better life.</p>
                    <p>5. As footnotes on methodology envisaged in program outlined in Bonn's 457, I would say
            (A) all of our experience has demonstrated that it is both fruitless and dangerous to
            attempt do business with Soviets on basis of implicit and undefined understanding of
            actions they are supposed to take, and (B) it is unrealistic to conceive that a deal of
            size and import envisaged could be kept secret.</p>

                    <p>The Ambassador inquired how we thought the German proposal on Berlin should be handled
            in the Ambassadorial group. In the British view the German draft had too much of the
            flavor of an internal political document. In the first place it should be recast in a
            form suitable for presentation <pb n="16" xml:id="pg_16" facs="0046"/>to the Soviets.
            The Secretary agreed. He said that the matter was now more urgent because there were
            some indications that the Russians were working on a proposal of their own and it was
            important to get in ahead of them.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador suggested sharing the drafting task. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GDA1">Greenhill</persName> was seeing Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> this afternoon to discuss British views. The Secretary wondered

                            <ref target="#d5">Documents 5</ref> and <ref target="#d6">6</ref>.</note> Plan for
            settlement German problem outlined Bonn's 2571 has been given careful study here and
            will continue receive our serious consideration. Meanwhile, we have following
            comments:</p>
                    <p>1. As specified in para 4 Bonn's 2571, plan as outlined depends on validity two basic
            assumptions:</p>
                    <p>a) that there is possibility, over period of years, to influence readjustment of Soviet
            long-range political objectives and basic political philosophy through device of
            offering economic assistance to <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, and</p>
                    <p>b) that it would be possible develop unified Western position on trade and credits to
              <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> along lines and on scale outlined in plan.</p>
                    <p>2. We are impressed by arguments advanced in Moscow's 2302 to support conclusion that
            there is no realistic basis for believing Soviets can be induced to accept radical
            reorientation of their long-range political objectives in exchange for Western
            assistance in overcoming their current economic difficulties. This is same conclusion
            arrived at in SNIE 11–5–64 dated Jan 8, 1964 on “Soviet Economic Problems and
              Outlook,”<note n="3" xml:id="d9fn3">See <ref target="#d5fn5">footnote 5, Document
                5</ref>.</note> which, after expressing view that current economic pressures in
              <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> are likely be productive of foreign policy of
            “relative restraint,” goes on to state (para 22): “We do not, however, believe that the
            Soviets would make major concessions in exchange for expanded Western credits or reduced
            Western defense expenditures.”</p>
                    <p>3. On this basis, plan as outlined would seem afford no basis for hoping that result
            desired re German settlement could be achieved. Moreover, as seen from Washington, there
            are truly formidable difficulties in way of trying reach agreement at this time on
            unified Western program of grants and credits to <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>,
            especially on scale contemplated (total of $40 billion of which US contribution would be
            $8 billion). Even an attempt to seek agreement on such a program could bring about
            stimulation of credit race to point of greatly easing Soviet economic difficulties and
            thereby removing major restraining factor in Soviet foreign policy.</p>
                    <p>4. In view above considerations we do not believe Erhard should be encouraged at this
            point to solicit US approach to Soviets on behalf <pb n="18" xml:id="pg_18" facs="0048"/>scheme for major Western initiative in trade and credit field. At same time we should
            avoid any course of action tending discourage Germans from coming up with new ideas and
            there would be no objection to inquiring of Erhard, in low key and on non-committal
            basis, whether he had further developed his thinking on ways and means to settle German
              problem.<note n="4" xml:id="d9fn4">In telegram 2855 from Bonn, February 12, <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> offered further comment on the possibility of

              would pass on U.S. views to Erhard. (Department of State, Central Files, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 32–4 <gloss target="#t_GER1">GER</gloss>)</note>

                    <p>After the Secretary's dinner for the Prime Minister at Blair House, he outlined to the
            Prime Minister and to the Foreign Secretary the three-phase proposals on Berlin and
            Germany. He told them that he could not leave the paper<note n="2" xml:id="d10fn2">No
              copy of the paper was found.</note> with them because the proposals merely represented
            tentative ideas on a bolder approach to the problem, and could not be considered as a US
            Government position. The Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary expressed interest in
            the idea, but the Prime Minister <pb n="19" xml:id="pg_19" facs="0049"/>said he strongly
            doubted whether the German Government would ever be willing to move decisively on the
            major issues, such as the boundaries question and security, which would be the condition
            for any Soviet acceptance of proposals by the West.</p>
                    <p>There was some discussion of how it might be possible to talk to Schroeder about this
            kind of approach without having the Germans go through the roof. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName> said he thought his personal relations with
            Schroeder were good and getting better, and that he might be able to talk to him alone
            (and he emphasized that this meant without anyone else being present) when they met
            again in March for the next <gloss target="#t_WEU1">WEU</gloss> meeting. Another
            possibility might be for Schroeder to come to Geneva from his skiing vacation in
            Switzerland to see Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName> when the latter
            goes there in another ten days. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName> said
            he would think the matter over.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary both lamented the negative state of mind
            of the Germans with regard to observation posts and said they hoped that some way might
            be found to bring them around to a more positive attitude. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> commented that the Germans probably saw in the
            observation posts proposal the thin end of a wedge which might lead to a reduction of
            forces and other types of “thinning out” in Central Europe before an acceptable
            political solution had been negotiated with the Soviet Union. He added that, in his
            view, any direct or implicit linking of observation posts with “thinning out” would
            merely confirm German suspicions and increase their opposition.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said we should persevere in our search for a possible initiative on
            Germany. This should be done by the kind of discussion they were now having and should
            be very tightly held. These matters should not be dealt with in the Ambassadorial Group.
            The Secretary suggested that we go back over the last three years and take a look at all
            the ideas and suggestions which the Germans have floated at one time or another on the
            Berlin and Germany question, and which have not been subsequently followed up. He
            thought that proposals could be put together on such a basis, which would contain many
            of the elements in the package which he had just described to the Prime Minister and the
            Foreign Secretary.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName>, who had joined the group halfway
            through the talk, emphasized the desirability of examining every possibility of coming
            up with a peace initiative in the course of this year which would win widespread public
            support.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>On eve of his departure today for Paris, Chancellor Erhard requested me to call on him
            for a general review of current problems, in which he ranged for an hour and a half over
            his forthcoming visit with President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>,
            French recognition Communist China, <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> situation,
            Passierschein problem, and a number of miscellaneous subjects being reported by separate
            telegrams. I took the opportunity to raise a number of points from our side, as
            indicated in Part IV.</p>
                    <p>Meeting with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>.</p>
                    <p>1. The Chancellor said that his visit to Paris should be regarded as one of the regular
            meetings agreed to under the Franco-German Treaty “to maintain contacts.” He could
            assure me that no change of policy was involved on the part of the German Government (I
            assumed he meant particularly with respect to Communist China), nor any change in the
            loyalty and friendship of the German Government toward the United States. Dr. Westrick,
            who was present, added that the large number of the group accompanying the Chancellor
            did not signify anything with regard to the importance of the visit, but merely
            reflected the obligations under the treaty to consult at particular levels.</p>
                    <p>2. The Chancellor commented that I should not believe everything that the press was
            saying with regard to the visit. (Although I do not know precisely what he was referring
            to, it may have been the article in the international edition of <hi rend="italic">The New York Times</hi> Feb.
            12, to the effect that he was going to Paris in an atmosphere of “improved Franco-German
            relations” and of “increasing respect” for <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName>'s policies. The article also appears to presage a change in policy
            on the part of Germany towards Communist China.)</p>
                    <p>3. The Chancellor assured me that he would much prefer to be going to the U.S. than to
            France. The Germans were in agreement with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName>, he said, on the question of friendship between France and Germany
              <pb n="21" xml:id="pg_21" facs="0051"/>and in all-German and Berlin matters. Looking
            at it broadly, however, he attached a great deal more significance to his relations with
            the U.S. and United Kingdom. He expected that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName> would tell him in Paris that he seeks a Europe not controlled by the
            U.S. He would tell de Gaulle that he does not feel Germany to be controlled by the U.S.,
            but indeed protected by the American Alliance. Referring to the de Gaulle press
            conference of January 31,<note n="3" xml:id="d11fn3">For text of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>'s January 31 press conference, see Charles
                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>, Discours et Messages, vol. 4, pp.
              162–182.</note> the Chancellor voiced the opinion that de Gaulle had in fact said
            nothing new. The Chancellor had been shocked, however, at the hardness of de Gaulle's
            attacks against the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and the U.S., which he construed
            as being more anti-Anglo-Saxon in their intent than pro-French.</p>
                    <p>French recognition of Communist China.<note n="4" xml:id="d11fn4">France announced its
              intention to accord diplomatic recognition on January 14.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>1. On the subject of Communist China, the Chancellor said that he felt <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>'s recognition of Peking was a dangerous act,
            the consequences of which cannot be foreseen. (He also had misgivings about de Gaulle's
            prospective visits to Latin America and South-East Asia.<note n="5" xml:id="d11fn5">
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> visited Mexico March 16–19 and Latin
                    America September 21–October 15. His East Asian tour took place in August–September
              1966.</note> He wondered what <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>'s
            motives were, since he could not increase his economic assistance to these areas without
            overstraining the French economy. The Chancellor foresaw additional problems that would
            be created by these visits.)</p>
                    <p>2. In response to his question about the consequences of French recognition of
            Communist China, I gave him my own interpretation in terms of (A) its effect on the
            nations of Southeast Asia and U.S. efforts to check Communist subversion and aggression
            there, and (B) the disruptive effects in the North Atlantic Alliance as a result of such
            an important matter not being discussed in the Council. The Chancellor added “not even
            with the Germans under the Franco-German Treaty,”<note n="6" xml:id="d11fn6">For text of
              the Franco-German Treaty on Organization and Principles of Cooperation, signed at
              Paris on January 22, 1963, see Documents on Germany, 1944–1985, pp. 834–838.</note>
            and pointed out the adverse effect French recognition would have on the question of
            recognition of the so-called <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>3. He asked what effect, in my view, this act of recognition might have on
            Chinese-Russian relations. Disclaiming any expert opinion in such matters, I expressed
            the view that it could be interpreted by the Soviets as an effort on the part of France
            to exploit the Russian-Chinese split. This was something we had scrupulously avoided
            doing, since the Russian reaction to such a move might well be to take steps to repair
            the split. Erhard wondered whether it could not have the opposite effect, i.e. if
            Western recognition and economic aid were given to Communist China, <pb n="22" xml:id="pg_22" facs="0052"/>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> might consider this to be an attack on
            him and he might thereby be forced to talk to the West.</p>
                    <p>4. I gave the Chancellor the background leading up to the break in relations by the
            Government of the Republic of China with France on February 10, as given in Depcirtel
              1479.<note n="7" xml:id="d11fn7">Circular telegram 1479, February 17, reported that
              the Chinese Nationalists had decided to sever diplomatic relations with France

              Central Files, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 17 CHINAT)</note> The Chancellor
            expressed regret that the break had not been at French initiative. I pointed out that in
            the light of the démarche by the French Charge in Taipei, which the Charge himself had
            interpreted as meaning that France intended to sever its relations with Taipei, the
            French really had taken the initiative.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Passes to the East Sector of Berlin.</p>
                    <p>1. During a brief interruption in the conversation, when the Chancellor had been called
            away, State Secretary Westrick referred to the Berlin Passierschein situation. He said
            that the German Government had reached the decision that they did not wish to repeat the
            Christmas pass precedent. It was quite clear that the Communists were only trying to
            make political capital out of a renewal of the Christmas pass arrangements, and this the
            German Government wished to avoid. The East German radio had said that East German
            officials had actually performed consular type functions in West Berlin. The German
            Government was interested in a continuation of visiting arrangements only if conditions
            could be improved over those for the Christmas passes.</p>
                    <pb n="23" xml:id="pg_23" facs="0053"/>
                    <p>2. One possible improvement, Westrick said, lay in prohibiting East German officials
            from coming to West Berlin, by their granting the necessary authority to appropriate
            West Berlin officials. The fact that the East Germans resist this proves that what they
            desire is only a political result. The East Germans have proposed the creation of an
            office in West Berlin for the handling of hardship cases. The German Government has
            asked why passes in such cases cannot be granted by telegram. The Federal Government
            will not accept any new arrangements which will have the effect of advancing the “three
            state” theory, with the city of West Berlin as the third state.</p>
                    <p>3. Westrick reported a difference in views within the Senat with respect to future
            visiting arrangements. Senator Arndt had resigned, pre-sumably in expression of his own
            differences with the Governing Mayor. Senator Schiller also proposed to resign. (The
            British Ambassador informs me that Arndt has in fact resigned because of ill health, and
            Schiller is considering merely the carrying out of long-held plans.) The Chancellor had
            that day conveyed to Mayor Brandt the views of the German Government and asked him to
            come to Bonn next week to discuss the matter further. According to Westrick, Brandt
            himself may show a greater tendency than the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> to
            compromise on issues with the East German officials. The difficulty lay in keeping a
            human problem from becoming a political problem. Westrick admitted that the FRG decision
            may have an effect on other existing arrangements, such as interzonal trade.</p>
                    <p>4. The Chancellor, who rejoined us at this point, added that the German Government was
            encountering considerable adverse reaction about the Christmas pass policy.
            Representatives of other nations (unspecified) had asked why they could not have
            relations with East Germany, since the West Germans themselves had established relations
            with East German officials in connection with the Christmas passes. The Chancellor said
            that he had that day told Mayor Brandt and Wehner, the deputy leader of the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss>, that Germany would be exposed to national disaster if
            the political parties were not able to agree on the question of further exchanges in
            Berlin.</p>
                    <p>5. In thanking the Chancellor for informing me about the latest developments, I said
            that, as at the time of the pre-Christmas negotiations, we had no wish to intervene in
            this matter, since in its present context we did not consider that it endangered Allied
            interests. As the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and the Berlin Senat were fully
            aware of the risks involved, as well as the opportunities, we had confidence that any
            arrangements they made between them would provide adequate safeguards.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>Lord Harlech asked whether the Secretary had yet received a reply from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName> to his message.<note n="2" xml:id="d13fn2">
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>'s message regarding an approach to the
              German Foreign Minister was transmitted in telegram 5244 to Bonn, February 19. (Ibid.,
                <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 28 <gloss target="#t_GER1">GER</gloss> B)</note>
            The Secretary said that nothing had yet come in. He pointed out that any suggestion of
            an Anglo-Saxon combine on proposals for the reunification of Germany would be deadly.
            For this reason he wanted to be able to tell the truth when he said there had been no
            exchange of papers between the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and the US Government.
            He was not going to give the Ambassador any document but would limit himself to
            discussing ideas with him. Otherwise we would certainly lose the Germans and the
            French.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he was concerned about surfacing the present German proposal. It did
            not have enough meat in it. It would risk “waking the sleeping dogs” and stimulating the
            Soviets at a time when we don't really have anything much in our position.</p>
                    <p>He said it appeared that Foreign Minister Schroeder felt that it would not be enough
            for him to make a speech on German reunification and that he needed, politically, to put
            forward some specific proposals.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary then gave Lord Harlech an oral outline of the “dream package.” He said
            that the way to deal with the various elements of the proposals was on the basis of
            “building blocks,” which could be discussed individually, e.g., European security, mixed
            commissions, and access problems pending reunification. He emphasized there should not
            be the slightest hint to the Russians that we had anything specific in mind. He and Lord
            Harlech agreed on the foregoing, and that no offer should be made which might hint that
            our thinking lay in the direction of a reunified but neutralized Germany.</p>
                    <p>There was then some discussion of the possibility of a reduction of forces in Central
            Europe by “mutual example.” So far there had been no <pb n="25" xml:id="pg_25" facs="0055"/>evidence of any pullback of Soviet troops even though there had been some
            reductions on the Western side.</p>
                    <p>Lord Harlech asked about a possible timetable. The Secretary said we should go right
            ahead and talk over the issues one by one, as he had already suggested, and we might
            eventually reach the stage where we found that we had the elements of a package. He
            thought there was a possibility that the Soviets might be planning to take an
            initiative. Also there was the possibility that the Germans themselves might feel that
            they must move. It was agreed that there would be further discussion in the
            Ambassadorial Group. Lord Harlech commented that he thought that the Ambassadorial Group
            machinery might make the process unduly long, and that the time might come when we would
            find it desirable to move in Bonn. The Secretary said we should go ahead with discussion
            in the Ambassadorial meeting and then perhaps we might have a quadripartite Foreign
            Ministers meeting in May before the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting. Lord
            Harlech said that if there was a hope of engaging the Soviet Union in talks some time
            this year, it was more likely that the Soviet Union would respond to a proposal in the
            form of a general agenda rather than of a detailed plan on which they would feel they
            must take a position right away. The Secretary said that if it were manageable it might
            be best to set up a Deputy Foreign Ministers group which would have some latitude in
            determining the course of the discussions.</p>
                    <p>Lord Harlech pointed out that the Germans were disinclined to get into too much
            discussion with the Soviets on peripheral issues, because in proportion as these were
            disposed of, the problem of Germany and Berlin acquired increasingly the character of a
            final obstacle to general agreement. He said he thought that any group that was set up
            should deal with the whole German problem. The Secretary repeated that the Russians
            might well be preparing their own proposals on this subject. He said that the time might
            come when the “satellites” might be in a position to play a role. They had a direct
            interest in the German question and their point of view might not always coincide
            entirely with that of the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>After the conversation with the Secretary, Lord Harlech told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> that <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> was
            thinking of the question of timing in relation to the holding of elections in the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. The timing of the latter would be a factor in determining
            whether it would be too late to wait until May before coming forward with some proposals
            to the Soviets, or at least letting it be known that such proposals were in the
            wind.</p>

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName>, at his request, called on the
            Secretary at 3:30 p.m. on February 28 for a general tour d'horizon. One of the subjects

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> asked about our attitude
            toward the German peace plan. The Secretary said that he felt this plan should be

                    <p>The Secretary said that he felt the three Western powers should discuss the question of
            Berlin passes. It was important not to concede in easy stages that Bonn is responsible
            and competent on this issue. The Western powers have the ultimate responsibility for
            Berlin. Ambassador Alphand agreed and observed that the question of passes was becoming
            a domestic issue in Germany.</p>

                    <p>Dear Mr. Chancellor:</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> had told me of his recent
            meetings with you.<note n="2" xml:id="d15fn2">In telegram 2993 from Bonn, February 20,

            fullest confidence, support and trust, and your use of him as a channel of communication
            with me, I feel, is advantageous to both of us.</p>
                    <p>In this spirit, Mr. Chancellor, I have asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> to deliver to you this letter giving you my thinking on some of the
            problems currently concerning us here in Washington.</p>
                    <p>At the outset, may I say how much I appreciate your continuing personal efforts for
            achieving an ever-closer relationship between a more cohesive Europe and the United
            States. As you know from our talks last December, we in the United States are following
            with sympathetic interest the efforts for strengthening European unity, and it is our
            sincerest hope that there will be a close identity of views between us all as we move
            into the very important <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> Round.</p>
                    <p>Among the more urgent issues occupying our attention these last weeks are Cyprus,
            Viet-Nam and Cuba.</p>
                    <p>I personally was pleased with the prompt attention you gave the question of possible
            German participation in the proposed peace-keeping operation on the embattled island of
              Cyprus.<note n="4" xml:id="d15fn4">In his February 13 meeting with <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName>, reported in telegram 2885 from Bonn, February
              13, Erhard stated: “He himself would have accepted the original proposal” for the
              employment of German forces. The plan had subsequently been modified. (Department of
              State, Central Files, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 7 <gloss target="#t_GER1">GER</gloss> W)</note> Although our original peace plan has been set aside, we
            continue to believe, as we have from the outset, that in the first instance peace must
            be restored to the island. This is not only necessary for humanitarian reasons; it is an
            essential prerequisite for a political solution. The issue is now before the Security
            Council and we are hoping for constructive action there. Events, however, continue to
            move rapidly and I know we can count on your constructive support <pb n="28" xml:id="pg_28" facs="0058"/>in dealing with this grave problem which involves three of
            our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies.</p>
                    <p>The problem in Viet-Nam remains difficult. We are firmly committed to assist the
            Government and the people of South Viet-Nam in maintaining their independence and
            freedom against externally directed and supported subversion and aggression. We believe
            this struggle can be won and that the new Government of South Viet-Nam under General
            Nguyen Khanh is capable of bringing this about. Clearly the fight is uphill and the
            situation serious. And it is for these very reasons we consider proposals for
            neutralization unfortunate and even harmful. They can serve only to create doubts among
            the Vietnamese people about the determination of the Free World to help them repel the
            Communist aggressors. I hope therefore that you and your Government will find ways and
            means to demonstrate your support for the Government and people of the Republic of
            Viet-Nam in their struggle against Communist aggression.</p>
                    <p>In connection with Cuba, I want to express my personal gratitude for the cooperation we
            have been receiving from the Federal Republic in limiting Castro's access to those Free
            World commodities which are so important to his economy. Given the nature of this
            continuing and complex problem, we will be looking to you and your Government for
            further assistance in attempting to make clear to our other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> partners that increased trade and transportation ties with Castro's
            Cuba, as well as governmental guarantees for export and insurance credits for that
            regime, not only jeopardize our efforts to reduce the Cuban-Communist threat to Latin
            America; they also undercut our broader purpose of achieving an orderly and progressive
            development in Latin America.</p>
                    <p>In this connection, let me say how pleased we were to learn that the Federal Republic
            and France were considering enlarging their economic assistance to Latin America. This
            is a constructive gesture, and I hope we can so coordinate our programs that our
            combined contributions will make for a maximum effort there. In this connection, it has
            occurred to us that perhaps the Development Assistance Committee of the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> might provide a useful mechanism for this purpose.</p>
                    <p>As for aid to the developing nations, I was glad to learn of the Federal Republic's
            increased contributions during 1963. I hope this contribution can be expanded in 1964.
            It is increasingly clear that such help is urgently needed for stabilization and growth
            in the developing areas, which, in turn, affect the Free World's political and economic
            interests.</p>
                    <p>At Geneva, where the resumed Eighteen-Nation Disarmament Conference has been meeting
            since January, there has been little significant progress thus far. But I do not feel
            there is any reason for pessimism or despair. On the contrary, I hope and think it
            likely that during the next months the Soviet Union will find it in its own
            self-interest to negotiate <pb n="29" xml:id="pg_29" facs="0059"/>seriously on the basis
            of the proposals I set before the Conference on January 21. I firmly believe the
            proposals I made can lead to a reduction in tensions, and hope that the German
            Government will not only support our position but will also have additional proposals to
            suggest. In any event, we intend to continue to consult closely with you as we try to
            move forward in this very important area so vital to the security and political
            objectives of our countries. For there is no doubt in my mind, Mr. Chancellor, that, in
            the last analysis, a slowing down in the arms race is more likely to help us achieve a
            free and reunified Germany, than an uncontrolled arms competition which strengthens
            those elements in Eastern Europe determined to resist change and perpetuate the present
            division of your country.</p>
                    <p>Before closing, I should tell you also that I have had very much in mind our exchange
            of views at the Ranch on defense matters. I particularly appreciated your clear
            understanding of the importance to the United States—in adhering to its commitment to
            maintain six divisions in Germany as long as needed—of continued offset purchases of
            military equipment by the Federal Republic. This arrangement clearly is beneficial to
            both countries, and, without question, should continue as long as needed. It is a matter
            of major importance to both our Governments that offset arrangements produce German
            military orders and payments to the United States fully equal to the annual levels of
            United States dollar defense expenditures of benefit to the Federal Republic's balance
            of payments. I have been assured by my staff that discussions between our respective
            defense organizations for future military equipment procurement will be resumed during
            the next weeks. I also understand from Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> that he will be meeting in May with Minister von Hassel to
            consider the results of these discussions and conclude agreements which will provide for
            full offset in orders and payments for the periods of 1963–64 and 1965–66. In this
            connection, Mr. Chancellor, I would personally appreciate your continuing support in
            this endeavor which is so important for the military security and financial strength of
            the Atlantic Community.</p>
                    <p>Thank you again for your kindnesses to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName>. I very much want to remain in touch with you and hope you will
            feel free to use Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> for this
            purpose.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName> called to ask if he could
            have an informal talk with me about the German peace plan. He would have preferred our
            having a lunch together, but since I was not free for several days, he said he would
            like to come to my office and talk with me alone on a completely unofficial basis. To
            this I agreed.</p>
                    <p>He asked me what was my own view of the German proposals. I said that if they were to
            be plausible as a serious initiative on reunification, they would have to be much more
            specific, particularly in the field of European security. For example, what does Bonn
            mean by reunification on a basis of no change in the balance of power to the detriment
            of <pb n="31" xml:id="pg_31" facs="0061"/>either side? The Ambassador did not think it
            was desirable to attempt to spell this concept out in detail in the proposals because if
            one did, the Russians would put any concession offered in their pocket and brush the
            rest of the proposals aside. He said that the French had from the start taken the
            position that it was, in present circumstances, impossible to arrive at an acceptable
            practical formula whereby Germany could be reunified without a change to the detriment
            of one of the two sides. The Ambassador said that the proposals must be considered as
            constituting one single package, whose component elements could not be isolated or
            extracted from the rest of the package.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador went on to say that several factors had conspired to convince Bonn that
            proposals on German reunification should be made within the next few months.</p>
                    <p>First of all, five years had elapsed since the last round of talks with the Russians on
            reunification, and the general impression was gradually being created in the world that
            reunification was something which was no longer topical, or relevant to the present
            evolution in East-West relations.</p>
                    <p>Second, there had latterly been an increase in public pressures in Germany in favor of
            some initiative on the part of the government to bring reunification to the fore again.
            What was more interesting, he said, was that there was an unmistakable increase of
            interest in reunification on the part of the youth of university age, together with
            increasing criticism of the government for its passivity in this field.</p>
                    <p>Third, there was evidence that in the rest of the world, the impression was growing
            that unification was becoming progressively less important to the German government, and
            that it was therefore increasingly possible to recognize or do business with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> with impunity, witness: recent developments in Ceylon,
            Zanzibar, and increased activities and initiatives by the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> in the <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>'s.<note n="3" xml:id="d16fn3">On February 14, the German Democratic Republic and Ceylon signed a consular exchange
              agreement. East Germany recognized the revolutionary government of Zanzibar on January
              28 and exchanged diplomatic representatives in early February.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Fourthly, there was an increasing tendency, particularly since the Moscow Test Ban
              Treaty,<note n="4" xml:id="d16fn4">For text of the Test Ban Treaty, signed in Moscow
              on August 5, 1963, and entered into force for the United States on October 10, see 14
              UST 1313.</note> for East-West discussions and negotiations to be concerned with
            matters other than reunification, witness: commercial and cultural relations, the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> in Geneva, talks about observation posts and other
            measures in the general field of security and disarmament, rather than political
            solutions of the causes of tension between the Soviet Union and the West, of which the
            chief in Europe is the problem of Germany and Berlin. Bonn feels it is essential, for
            the foregoing reasons, <pb n="32" xml:id="pg_32" facs="0062"/>to put reunification back
            in the middle of the table so as to make it clear not only to the Soviet Union but to
            everyone that reunification of Germany remains, and will continue to remain a major
            Western goal.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador said he had recently been called by Reinkemeyer (In Charge of Soviet
            Affairs in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Bonn), who had reflected some impatience
            with the slowness of discussion in the Ambassadorial Group, and had pressed to know when
            the next step would be taken. The Ambassador told him that the British and the French
            were awaiting instructions and that it was hoped to meet again early next week.
            Reinkemeyer had said that it was Bonn's definite hope that four-power agreement could be
            reached before the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting in early May.</p>
                    <p>I told the Ambassador that I was familiar with his talk with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> yesterday. I wondered whether it was desirable
            to put forward proposals unless they were likely to appear convincing to public opinion
            as a sincere attempt to move forward toward a basis of negotiation with the Russians.
            There was also the question whether, if proposals were made now, the Russians might take
            the opportunity to uncork some counter proposals of their own which could stir things up
            in an unhelpful manner.</p>
                    <p>I asked whether the Federal Government was thinking of proposals in terms of their
            appeal to the Soviet government, or whether it wanted to make some gesture which would
            focus world attention on German reunification, and which would serve to refute any
            charge of inactivity in this field on the part of the Federal Government. The Ambassador
            said his instructions made it clear that the degree of appeal the proposals might have
            for the Soviet Union is, in the view of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, of
            secondary importance. The primary objective is to counteract the present trend, to which
            he had already referred, of talking with the Russians about everything other than German
            reunification.</p>
                    <p>I asked whether Bonn had given any consideration to some kind of a manifesto or
            declaration on reunification which could be submitted to the four powers and publicized
            suitably, and which would serve the political purpose his government had in mind without
            incurring the possible dangers of putting forward an inadequate proposal which might
            complicate things for Germany and the West in general. I emphasized that I was not
            suggesting this and that I was speaking only for myself. The Ambassador said he did not
            know whether any such idea had been considered.</p>
                    <p>Toward the end of our talk the Ambassador came back to his central point of the need
            “to do something about reunification.” He said we had doubtless noticed that in the
            present German proposals Berlin plays a minor role. He said this was because the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> does not want to give prominence to a possible access
            agreement for fear that the Russians <pb n="33" xml:id="pg_33" facs="0063"/>would again
            do what they did in Geneva in 1959, i.e.: concentrate on Berlin to the exclusion of the
            central issue of reunification.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion the Ambassador said he appreciated this opportunity of discussing the
            situation with me and he repeated that he considered our conversation as private and
            unofficial.</p>

                    <p>3170. Subject: <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> reunification plan.</p>
                    <p>1. As has been reported separately both Krapf and Carstens have urged during the past
            week that we move ahead energetically in considering the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> reunification plan now before the Ambassadorial Group in Washington.<note n="2" xml:id="d17fn2">The Embassy reported the conversation with Krapf in telegram
              3025 from Bonn, February 25. (Ibid.) No record of the conversation with Carstens was
              found.</note> Both have quite frankly referred to the government's internal political
            need to show initiative in this field. This fits in with other reports which lead me to
            conclude that the FonOff, with some reason, fears that unless it can point to progress
            in connection with the plan, it will come under attack by the more conservative elements
            in the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_CSU1">CSU</gloss>
            (Guttenberg for example), the always experiment minded <gloss target="#t_FDP1">FDP</gloss>, and the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>2. With this in the background, I feel it would be wise to give the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> some evidence of forward progress in reaching an
            agreement based on its proposal without much delay. Otherwise we can hardly expect it to
            accommodate us in our objective of reaching certain agreements with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> which, while desirable from an over-all Western point
            of view, are not likely to contribute directly to a solution of the German problem. A
            good case can also be made that the West should, in any event, keep up to date a basic
            negotiating position on reunification, whether or not there is any likelihood of its
            being accepted by the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>3. I recognize, as do the Germans, that anything within the general framework of the
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> plan will not be attractive to the Soviets as a
            negotiating document. In commenting on the plan earlier (Embtel 2513)<note n="3" xml:id="d17fn3">Dated January 19. (Ibid.)</note> we <pb n="34" xml:id="pg_34" facs="0064"/>pointed out certain disadvantages to its official endorsement by the
            Allies or its presentation to the Soviets by them. As things are now developing in the
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, however, I am inclined to feel that in the
            interest of progress in other areas of negotiation with the Soviets, and of our
            bilateral relations with the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, it will be difficult
            for us to withhold official support from some such plan indefinitely.</p>
                    <p>4. Elements of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> plan, from our point of view,
            provide an essentially sound basis for an Allied agreed plan. We have, in Embtel 2513,
            made various suggestions on possible modification and we understand that others are
            presently under discussion in Washington. We have been given to understand by the
            Foreign Office, moreover, that there is at least a limited flexibility in the
            relationship of the various parts of the proposal to the whole (para 3, Embtel
              2465).<note n="4" xml:id="d17fn4">Dated January 14. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 28 <gloss target="#t_GER1">GER</gloss> B)</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>5. One feature of the plan which might have attraction for the Communists is its
            reference to the possible extension of assistance to East Germany (para 6 of the
            proposal). Recent statements by <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> leaders would
            indicate the possibility of considering this together with the establishment of
            humanitarian commissions. We have commented in some detail on other positive aspects of
            the plan in the Embassy's A–587.<note n="5" xml:id="d17fn5">Dated October 4, 1963.
              (Ibid., SOC 14 E GERM)</note> The establishment of the humanitarian commissions
            described in para 4 of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> proposal could eventually
            have favorable results from the all-German point of view, although the Soviets will
            probably reject the commission concept even if isolated from the rest of the plan since
            the commissions are described as working “by direction of the four powers.” We cannot
            know for certain that they will be rejected, however, until the Soviets are tested, and,
            as the Secretary recently commented, it is not up to us to do the Soviets' negotiating
            for them. In any event, the putting forward of this plan, backed by the West, would put
            the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> in a position of having taken an initiative in
            this area which would be helpful in view of the current efforts of the East German
            Communists to utilize the appeal of increased contacts for their own purposes.</p>
                    <p>6. I now feel, therefore, that it will be in our best interest to join with the other
            Allies and the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> in developing some such plan, as
            appropriately amended through consultation, and if the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> insists, in associating ourselves in some way with its presentation to
            the Russians. This latter could take the form of an <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
            public initiative, which the three Allies could state was with their concurrence, or a
            tripartite note to the Soviets transmitting the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
            proposal as modified which the Allies would endorse. At the same time, we should make
            clear to the Germans our expectation that, as Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> agreed with President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> in Texas, they would cooperate with us in seeking other areas of
            possible <pb n="35" xml:id="pg_35" facs="0065"/>agreement with the Soviets. This subject
            will be discussed further in a subsequent Embtel.<note n="6" xml:id="d17fn6">In telegram

                    <p>Lord Harlech said that he had received by letter Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName>'s views on what the Secretary had said on the above subject when
            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName> was in Washington.<note n="2" xml:id="d18fn2">See <ref target="#d10">Document 10</ref>.</note>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName> had hoped to see Foreign Minister
            Schroeder in Switzerland but had not and does not see any prospect that he will see
            Schroeder before the <gloss target="#t_WEU1">WEU</gloss> meeting at Brussels on April
            16–17. Moreover, on reflection, Butler does not care for the role of putting to
            Schroe-der such a far-reaching proposal for negotiations with the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>Butler agrees to all that the Secretary had said in their Washington meeting and is
            prepared to back whatever the United States is prepared to do. But for two reasons
            Butler thinks that it is up to the United States to decide if it is prepared to take the
            initiative that the Secretary had outlined: the Germans depend more on the United States
            than on the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, and the United Kingdom has not been too
            successful with its relationship <pb n="36" xml:id="pg_36" facs="0066"/>with the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> lately. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> is trying
            hard and does not want to prejudice their efforts.</p>
                    <p>The British believe therefore that we should continue the work in the Ambassadorial
            Group and see where we get to. Concerning timing the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
            believes that the Soviets do not feel any pressure to do something but that the Germans,
            for domestic political reasons, do want to take an initiative on reunification. The
            British think that it would be unfortunate to take an initiative that would be
            half-baked. They hope that the Washington Ambassadorial Group can proceed quickly enough
            and that the discussion there can be conducted so as to turn the present document to
            something worthwhile, either as a diplomatic proposal to the Soviets or as a unilateral
            statement which the Germans could make and to which the Three Powers could appropriately
            refer.</p>
                    <p>In particular about the outline of the proposal which the Secretary had sketched at
            their meeting in Washington, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName> believes
            that the reduction of forces in the second phase would have to be wider than just
            Germany. He thought the European security arrangements should be based on the 1959
              proposals.<note n="3" xml:id="d18fn3">For texts of the 1959 proposals exchanged by the
              Soviet Union and Western Allies on European security, see American Foreign Policy:
              Current Documents, 1959, pp. 558–601, 612–613, 618–639, and 655–664.</note> He also
            thought it necessary to avoid a neutral Germany at all costs. As to the
            long-term-credits point, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName> wondered
            whether these were to come from the West in general or from the United States. The
            Secretary said that they would come most particularly from the Federal Republic. He
            recalled that Erhard had hinted that the Federal Republic would be willing to extend
            such credits although he had said nothing lately about this.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked whether the Foreign Secretary or the Prime Minister felt that the
            prospect of elections in the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would stimulate a desire
            for an initiative. He said that as far as we are concerned there is not much steam just
            for an initiative. Lord Harlech said that likewise there would not seem to be much steam
            for it in the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary thought that <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> would be
            very skeptical of a Four-Power Council proposal made just before elections in the
            several countries. Lord Harlech said that, from a foreign policy point of view, the
              <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would like to move, not so much because the Soviets
            are in a mood to reach major agreements, but there is advantage for the West to take an
            initiative. It is unwise to leave the present situation alone for a long time and let
            the Soviets get the credit for being the only ones interested in taking an initiative.
            For the Western Powers the sine qua non is something serious to discuss with the
            Soviets. A Four-Power meeting with the Soviets is not an end in itself.</p>
                    <pb n="37" xml:id="pg_37" facs="0067"/>
                    <p>Lord Harlech said that the situation in Bonn does not look hopeful for getting an
            elaboration of the German plan. He wondered whether the Secretary or a personal emissary
            might take the matter up directly with Schroeder. If he would say this package is a
            non-starter as a proposal, we could all look at the thing again.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> pointed out that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> is very sensitive to the charge of inertia on the subject
            of reunification. There is dissatisfaction particularly among the youth and press that
            there has been no progress on the subject in nearly five years. But the Government feels
            that discussion on disarmament and other issues than reunification tends to shunt
            reunification to the side and to make it appear to be something not of actual concern.
            The Secretary asked whether we should go back to the Germans, saying that this is their
            paper, that it mentions security and balance, and that now they must come up with ideas
            on what they mean. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> said that the
            Germans are afraid to put forward separately specific concessions that they might
            otherwise be prepared to make as part of a package. They fear the Soviets would put the
            concessions in their pocket and then refuse to talk about anything else.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> wondered whether it is really
            necessary that proposals be put forward. If what the Germans want is to put
            reunification at the center of the stage and as the goal of the West, they might publish
            a manifesto, to which the Western Powers might subscribe. Lord Harlech said it depends
            on one's objective. Earlier on in the fall the situation in Germany and Berlin was
            quiet. Always before we had understood that one could not make proposals or even have
            talks in periods of tension. Here was a quiet moment which therefore was a good time to
            put forward proposals. He still thinks it is so, but it does not appear that the Germans
            are willing to go for anything. He wondered if the Secretary could have a blunt talk
            with them. The Secretary observed that he might have a talk with Schroeder as a
            follow-up to the Erhard talk at the <gloss target="#t_LBJ1">LBJ</gloss> ranch and said
            that he would give more thought to Lord Harlech's suggestion.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that he had suggested to Schroeder a long time ago that the
            initiative that the Germans have in mind might take the form of a major policy speech by
              <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> or Schroeder to which we could make an
            appropriate response. But Schroeder had made it plain that that was not enough. The
            Secretary said he had cautioned Schroeder that the more the Germans talked of
            reunification the more the likelihood that they would face the question of reunification
            of what, thus raising the question of the Oder-Neisse line.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> recalled that the Germans always
            revert to the Potsdam Agreement under which the disposition of the Eastern territories
            is to be left to the final peace conference. Lord Harlech said that this card that the
            Germans hope to play is getting steadily weaker. The Secretary observed that, as far as
            the Russians are concerned, it is not a card at all any more.</p>
                    <pb n="38" xml:id="pg_38" facs="0068"/>
                    <p>After it was noted that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName> had
            not been able to give much of a background to the German thinking behind their
            initiative the Secretary wondered if we could get Carstens to come over and give more
            elucidation of what the Germans have in mind. Lord Harlech observed that Carstens is
            quite rigid and doubted that we would get much from him on Erhard or Schroeder's view on
            how far the Germans might go.</p>
                    <p>Lord Harlech thought that in as much as the British, French and Americans now have
            positions on the German proposal the discussion in the Ambassadorial Group might get
            down to another round of questions. The Secretary asked if the French had their
            instructions and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PGW1">Penberthy</persName> outlined them
            briefly as they had been given to him. It appeared to the Secretary that, if the French
            should make a presentation along the lines of the instructions just set forth and if the
              <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and US followed the views that we had expressed to
            each other, the discussions in the Ambassadorial Group would not be fruitful until the
            Germans could come up with something better.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked whether the Germans had asked us to slow down in coming to
            agreements in other areas because of their desire to come to some agreement on
            reunification. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> said no, but pointed out
            that the Germans are very depressed about Zanzibar and Ceylon. It looks to them as
            though the Hallstein Doctrine<note n="4" xml:id="d18fn4">Reference is to the 1955
              statement by Foreign Minister Hallstein that Germany would not establish or maintain
              diplomatic relations with any state, except the Soviet Union, that recognized the
              German Democratic Republic.</note> were weakening. The Germans are feeling politically
            vulnerable. Lord Harlech observed that the Germans have certainly showed no enthusiasm
            for OPs or nondissemination at Geneva but they have not said they are holding back, in
            order to get reunfication back to the center of the stage. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> noted that they have not said it but it is implicit
            in their attitude.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that he thought we had better then go ahead with the Ambassadorial
            Group discussions and in the meantime he would be thinking over the suggestions Lord
            Harlech had made about blunt talk with the Germans.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary noted that Brandt and Erhard had agreed on the pass business and wondered
            what this meant. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> said they had had a
            meeting and had issued a communiqué which papered over their differences. The fact,
            however, is that there are elements in Bonn which see the prospects of increased
            contacts in a different light from Brandt. Brandt's February 28 TV program<note n="5" xml:id="d18fn5">In his address, Brandt called for West German authorities to reach
              basic agreement on policy regarding its approach to issues like the Berlin passes. The
              Mission commented on the impact of Brandt's statement in telegram 1123 from Berlin,
              February 29. (Department of State, Central Files, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss>
              33–10)</note> had angered people entertaining this view.</p>
                    <pb n="39" xml:id="pg_39" facs="0069"/>
                    <p>The Secretary then asked about the flurry that had occurred in Parliament when
              <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> got home relative to the use of British
            forces under the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Lord Harlech said that this had been
            distorted out of proportion but that it had all blown over now. The Secretary noted that
            he had been embarrassed in his press conference about this, since we had been
            encouraging small countries like Sweden to put their military under <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> control.</p>

            incident which occurred this morning. The President wants you to know that he is deeply

            the recent T–39 incident. He further wants to know why we violate East German air space

                    <p>On the sound assumption that the RB–66 will not be our last airplane incident, George
              <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName>'s proposal for reaching some
            understanding with the Soviets on “landing signals” might not be a bad idea (Bonn's
            3311, attached).<note n="2" xml:id="d20fn2">Not printed.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>We, of course, would have to check this out with the Pentagon and the Department to
            make sure that we are not biting off a lot more than we intended. It is also clear that
            we cannot rush into this kind of thing so long as the RB–66 case is around. For that
            matter, I don't really think we can do much more about the US–<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> Air Agreement<note n="3" xml:id="d20fn3">For text of the air transport
              agreement, initialed at Moscow on August 21, 1961, signed at Washington and entered
              into force on November 4, 1966, see 17 UST 1909.</note> while the RB–66 men remain in
            Soviet hands.<note n="4" xml:id="d20fn4">A marginal handwritten notation by <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">McGeorge Bundy</persName> reads: “I agree strongly and this point
              should be made to Sovs.”</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>But, on the assumption that the RB–66 case will be cleared up, and that we will be
            going through with the Air Agreement, it would seem to make sense to talk with the
            Soviets about landing signals, unless there are substantial objections. (I will test
            this with Tommy this afternoon.)</p>
                    <p>Incidentally, from my reading of the RB–66 case, it seems fairly clear that the Soviets
            still have the problem in hand and have not turned it over to the East Germans. I base
            this on the fact that the injured airman is being treated at a Soviet hospital rather
            than an East German institution. This makes me suspect that the Soviets may be waiting a
            respectable period before proposing that our “spies” be exchanged for theirs—the Ivanov
            whom they wanted to trade for Barghoorn last November. This clearly may not be the best
            route for us, but it may be the most practicable one.</p>
                    <p>In this connection, I think it is most important that we keep the pressures on the
            Soviets—in a non-hysterical way—to return the RB–66 men.<note n="5" xml:id="d20fn5">One

                    <p>The Secretary said he wanted to talk to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> about the RB–66 fliers, since this could be troublesome.<note n="2" xml:id="d21fn2">For text of notes exchanged between the United States and Soviet
              Union concerning the incident, see American Foreign Policy: Current Documents, 1964,

            is no denial of this, and we have already expressed our regret. How it got where it did
            is still a deep mystery. We have sent senior officers to make a full investigation, and
            have checked everything out as far as we could, short of actually talking with the
            crew.</p>
                    <p>The plane was on a mission from Touls to just short of the North Sea. At 1358 the plane
            reported it was over its destination and was turning. At 1400, two minutes later, it was
            attacked. When it reported, therefore, it was already 150 miles off its course without
            knowing it. How the plane managed to make a 90 degree turn and not know it was lost we
            cannot explain.</p>
                    <pb n="42" xml:id="pg_42" facs="0072"/>
                    <p>The Secretary said that the first point he wanted to make, therefore, was a solemn
            statement, for the U.S. Government, that the plane was not engaged in any mission in
            East Germany. Apart from our policy, which would preclude this, we have looked into the
            briefing and flight plan for this specific flight. We have the impression that the
            Soviet Government is in the process of deciding what to do. It is therefore important
            that <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> know that the plane was off
            course, that we regret this, and that we have expressed our regrets.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that the second point he wanted to make was that he thought that the
            Soviet military had acted too fast in shooting down the plane. When Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> commented they were merely following orders, the
            Secretary replied that in that case the orders called for them to act too fast. He said
            there is quite a gap between Soviet orders and ours. We give signals, and help the plane
            turn back. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said the Soviets
            do the same. The Secretary replied that they had not in this case. Unlike the T–39 case,
            we had some communication with the RB–66, and if they had been aware of any signals, we
            would have heard from them.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> commented that someone had
            told him in connection with the T–39 case that there had been no warning, and then had
            to say he was wrong two days later. Perhaps when the US speaks with the fliers in this
            case, they will also find they were wrong.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that there have been intrusions in both directions, and suggested
            that at some stage we ought perhaps to talk about procedures. Perhaps we would find, he
            added, that the Soviet procedures are better.</p>
                    <p>As a third point, the Secretary noted that US medical officers have seen one of the
            fliers. He said that we appreciate the fact that he is getting good medical care, but do
            think the Soviets ought to give the fliers back promptly. If it were the other way
            around, we would have no problem in dealing with it as accidental. It is important that
            the Soviets not try to create an incident that is not there, but treat it as an
            accident, for it would eat into other matters, and it should not be allowed to do that.
            If the fliers are returned, there should not be any matter of prestige, since this would
            be in the same category as helping people in distress at sea. The Secretary said he was
            certain the Soviet military people could confirm what he had said about the plane being
            off course. He strongly urged <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> to pass to
              <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> his earnest hope that they release the fliers and get the case
            over with, since it is not worth the irritations it would create.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he would inform
              <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>. He added that he had no new

                    <p>I called on the President on March 23. Since the President was slightly indisposed
                            following his return to Washington from a speech in Atlantic City,<note n="2" xml:id="d22fn2">For text, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States:
              Lyndon B. Johnson, 1964</hi>, Book I, pp. 408–412.</note> I saw him in his private quarters
            and made my visit brief.</p>
                    <p>I gave the President an overall summary of the current state of our relations with
            Germany, making the following points:</p>
                    <p>1. Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> had constantly reassured
            me, and in my judgment had also so indicated by his actions, that he placed primary
            emphasis on Germany's relations with the United States. In this connection he had
            reiterated to me frequently his great confidence in the President and his desire to work
            very closely with him at all times. In particular, he had greatly appreciated the recent
            letter which the President had transmitted to him through me.<note n="3" xml:id="d22fn3">
                            <ref target="#d15">Document 15</ref>.</note> He had commented on that occasion that he
            was in full agreement with the letter, and that there was no question it raised which he
            and the President could not work out together.</p>
                    <p>2. I indicated to the President that in my judgment there were at the present time no
            important bilateral problems between us and Germany. <pb n="44" xml:id="pg_44" facs="0074"/>There is the continuing need to reassure Germany of our interest in their
            fundamental objective of reunification; to consult with them fully on East-West
            negotiations, in disarmament and other matters; and to convince them of our continued
            faithfulness to our commitment to maintain the equivalent of six divisions under <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> command in Europe as long as they are required. There
            were, however, no serious questions being raised in Germany at the present time on these
            grounds.</p>
                    <p>3. I advised the President that in my judgment the most important aspect of our
            relations with Germany at the present time lay in enlisting German support and
            coordinating our common efforts with respect to certain important common objectives.
            These included:</p>
                    <p>a. The <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, which the Germans strongly support;</p>
                    <p>b. The <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> Round, the success of which the
            Germans support and to which Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>
            is personally committed;</p>
                    <p>c. The European unity movement within the framework of Atlantic partnership. Although
            little forward progress can be made until after the British elections, we both seek to
            avoid domination by any one power or group of powers, and at least to leave the door
            open for ultimate British entry.</p>
                    <p>I observed to the President that in all of these matters we and the Germans saw eye to
            eye. The principal task lay in coordinating our policies and tactics. The only real
            divergence in views between us concerned certain aspects of agricultural policy as
            related to the <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> Round.</p>
                    <p>The President followed what I said with apparent interest, asking questions on
            occasion. He appeared to be in general agreement with the analysis I had given and the
            conclusions I had reached.</p>
                    <p>The President asked that upon my return I relay his personal greetings to Chancellor
              <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>, and that I convey to him his great
            confidence in him and his desire to coordinate closely with him all matters of common
            interest to our two countries. I should tell him that he hoped the Chancellor would
            continue to convey through me his thoughts on particular issues as they arise. He would
            on his part continue to communicate with the Chancellor on appropriate occasions.</p>

                    <p>Dear David:</p>
                    <p>In your letter of March 26<note n="2" xml:id="d23fn2">Not printed. (Ibid.)</note> you
            asked how our ideas are shaping up with regard to the German reunification plan and
            whether I have given any more thought to the question of letting Schroeder know in a
            private talk sometime before the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Ministerial
            meeting, or through a personal emissary, how we feel about his proposal.</p>
                    <p>I do not expect to have an opportunity to talk to Schroeder between now and the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Ministerial meetings. However, when George <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> was here, I asked him to let Schroeder know, in
            low-key fashion, that we simply do not feel that the German proposals are good enough.
            As a result of the recent Ambassadorial Group meetings I think the Germans now
            understand that for an initiative to be acceptable to us they will have to inject more
            substance into it than they already have. <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName>'s talk will also serve to make our attitude clear. As far as I know
            he has not yet talked with Schroeder.</p>
                    <p>As Bill <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> told Denis <persName corresp="#p_GDA1">Greenhill</persName>,<note n="3" xml:id="d23fn3">No record of this
              conversation was found.</note> I am considering writing a letter to Schroeder but
            believe it would be best to await the outcome of the next Ambassadorial Group meeting
            before deciding. At that time, we should have a better idea of how far the Germans will
            be prepared to go on the question of European security.</p>
                    <p>Please tell Rab <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName> for me that I appreciate
            his willingness to make the necessary arrangements for a four power talk at the time of
            the meetings in The Hague. Depending upon developments in the Ambassadorial Group, it
            will probably be useful to have a good discussion on the German initiative.</p>
                    <p>With warm regards,</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary stated that so far the Communist delegates at the Geneva talks<note n="2" xml:id="d24fn2">Reference is to the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development
              held at Geneva March 23–June 16.</note> have engaged in less mischief than might have
            been expected. The Soviet Minister's speech, in fact, was quite mild.</p>
                    <p>The Minister agreed, but said he remains cautious about the future—many problems are
            yet to be faced. As a consequence of the discussions he has had during the past few days
            he has come to understand the United States position on stabilizing world commodity
            prices, etc. He appreciates our “reserved position” on these matters, and will take a
            similar line with his colleagues in Bonn.</p>
                    <p>The Minister continued that he also tends to agree with the United States position
            regarding trade preferences for the <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>'s, but it must
            be recognized that certain preferences, such as those provided to a number of new
            nations by the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>, are required. He has received the
            impression in Washington that the United States considers that the <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> Round will reduce the significance of these
            preferences.</p>
                    <p>What we must guard against, the Minister warned, is the wrecking of the whole
            international trading system, including the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>, by
            the <pb n="47" xml:id="pg_47" facs="0077"/>decisions of the Geneva conference. It is
            gratifying to learn that no real difference of opinion exists among the US, <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and even the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> on
            matters of substance, as well as institutional issues, in connection with <gloss target="#t_UNCTAD1">UNCTAD</gloss>.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Kennedy Round</p>
                    <p>The Minister briefly outlined some of the matters he had discussed with Governor
              <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> during the previous hour,<note n="3" xml:id="d24fn3">These talks were summarized in circular telegram 1908, April 13.
              (Department of State, Central Files, INCO GRAINS <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>)
              Christian Herter was the U.S. Special Representative for Trade Negotiations.</note>
            and said he is of the opinion that American offcials are overemphasizing the technical
            difficulties connected with the disparities issue. He believes he got this point across
            to Governor Herter, and hopes that the Americans can understand why Austria, Switzerland
            and Denmark must be given special treatment because of their close geographic proximity
            and traditional economic relationships with Germany and France.</p>
                    <p>The Minister's ensuing remarks on the subject of the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> negotiations rambled somewhat and their meaning was always not entirely
            clear. He said that, especially when it comes to agriculture, we must not think in terms
            of tariffs alone—subsidies must be taken fully into account even though it is difficult
            to obtain full information about them. In every country he has visited he asked about
            the subsidies provided to that nation's agricultural sector, and in every country he has
            found that this is top secret information. He has figures which indicate that in some
            countries subsidies constitute 25 percent of the price of farm products. But the truth
            is that no one knows what subsidies the other partners are giving. One country gives
            subsidies to lower prices, another gives subsidies to raise prices. The Federal Republic
            ties its subsidies to production, other countries do not. This situation is not only
            confusing, it causes enormous waste.</p>
                    <p>Establishment of common agricultural prices in the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>,
            therefore, will take considerable time. Governor Herter, the Minister added, agrees with
            him that this is a subject which should be debated extensively. The wheat price cannot
            be settled until the subsidies problem has been solved. If a wheat price is agreed upon
            first, it will not be possible to bring pressures to bear to harmonize subsidies.</p>
                    <p>When, the Minister asked the Under Secretary, do we really have to decide upon grains
            prices? Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> indicated we should try
            to settle the price problem quickly, but he also agreed that we cannot entirely separate
            the price issue from other matters that must be negotiated. The Chancellor goes along
            with the latter point—that is, all these matters should be negotiated together during
            the course of the <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> Round.</p>
                    <pb n="48" xml:id="pg_48" facs="0078"/>
                    <p>The Under Secretary asked whether the Federal Republic wouldn't find it easier from the
            political standpoint to come to a decision on grains prices during the next month or
            two, rather than some time later which would be closer to elections.</p>
                    <p>The Minister said opinions differ on this question in the Federal Republic, but the
            Cabinet generally agrees that the time to fix grains prices will be when the gap between
            German and French prices has been reduced. Under present circumstances, subsidies of
              <gloss target="#t_DM1">DM</gloss> 2,000 would have to be paid per farm. This is
            impossible. Poor workers would have to contribute to the incomes of rich farmers. The
            workers would certainly demand equal subsidies.</p>
                    <p>If all these matters are negotiated as part of the <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> Round, the Minister continued, there is no immediate need to
            settle such complex issues as price and subsidy-price relationships immediately.
            Furthermore, there is much more to the <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName>
            Round than agriculture. We should not spoil our chances to accomplish something “in the
            big picture” simply because we have problems with agriculture.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary pointed out we have a definite interest in the grains price
            problem, but we have not made their fixing a hard-and-fast precondition for beginning
            the negotiations. He asked Mr. Greenwald for his comments on this subject.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Greenwald agreed with the Under Secretary, and added that, of course, if price
            unification can be worked out at a proper level now, even if implementation must be
            delayed, that would represent the best solution. We are not “holding out” for such a
            decision, however.</p>
                    <p>The Minister said he agrees with this position, but again stated that agreement on
            prices will not be easy because no one knows enough about the varied, hidden and
            difficult-to-calculate subsidies that are involved in current prices. To what extent,
            for example, does the United States wheat price represent subsidy payments? Without this
            information and similar data on subsidies paid in each of the European countries, how
            can we relate various countries' prices?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Greenwald acknowledged that it is difficult to make these calculations, and added
            that this is one problem we have with the Mansholt plan.<note n="4" xml:id="d24fn4">Reference is to the plan for a European agricultural free trade zone that became the
              basis for the Common Agricultural Policy of the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>.</note> The Under Secretary remarked that it is not a matter of keeping
            the data on US subsidies secret, but calculating them is very complicated.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">East-West Trade</p>
                    <p>The Minister referred to what appears to him to be a rethinking exercise in progress in
            the United States on the subject of trade with the Communist countries. It is generally
            considered likely, he said, that the <pb n="49" xml:id="pg_49" facs="0079"/>United
            States will change its policies in this regard. It is speculated, for example, that the
            United States will extend credits to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> up to
            Bern Union limits.<note n="5" xml:id="d24fn5">Apparent reference to the European
              Payments Union.</note> This is somewhat puzzling to him, in as much as Americans
            continue to tell officials of the Federal Republic that West German trade with the Bloc
            is so large that no thought should be given to increasing it. The Under Secretary should
            not overlook West Germany's geographic position and its traditional trade ties with the
            East.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary stated that we do have our policy on trade with the Bloc under
            review, though it should be kept in mind that our actions in this field are not entirely
            governed by administrative decision, but are in many respects affected by law. We do not
            foresee any radical changes in our trade with the Bloc.</p>
                    <p>We do feel, the Under Secretary continued, that we should distinguish between the
              <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the Eastern European countries. There may be
            considerable advantage in increasing trade with the latter, even if credits would be
            involved. Such credits, he believed, should fall within the Bern Union rules; i.e., five
            years, except for larger ships and aircraft where seven years' credit may be extended.
            The Under Secretary explained the provisions of the <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> Act,<note n="6" xml:id="d24fn6">For text of the Johnson Debt
              Default Act, signed on April 13, 1934, see 48 Stat. 547. The Act was amended on July
              31, 1945, to exempt foreign governments who were members of the International Monetary
              Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development from some of its
              provisions. (59 Stat. 516)</note> and pointed out that government-guaranteed credits
            cannot be provided to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> because that country is
            in default on settlement of its lend-lease obligations. This is not a problem with the
            Eastern European countries.</p>
                    <p>While the Attorney General ruled that normal 18 month credits could be provided to the
              <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in the case of the wheat deal, we do not believe
            that we would have even this flexibility if industrial plants were involved. Perhaps we
            could defer payment until a plant were installed, but we could not go beyond this
            limit.</p>
                    <p>As far as trade in strategic goods is concerned, we continue to adhere to a policy of
            strict compliance with <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> and other prohibitions.
            Problems arise, however, with items which are not on the strategic list but involve
            sophisticated technology. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> frequently only
            wants to obtain prototype models of such equipment which it then copies. They do not
            want our production, they want our technology.</p>
                    <p>It is this category of goods—non-strategic items of sophisticated technology—that
            requires the greatest study. While no final conclusions have been drawn, we feel that we
            probably will have to continue to decide each case individually on its merits. This
            isn't any easy policy to administer, but it is probably a necessary one.</p>
                    <pb n="50" xml:id="pg_50" facs="0080"/>
                    <p>Another problem involved in establishing internal policy guidelines for trade with the
            Bloc results from the absence of common Western policies. For example, we recently
            considered a proposal to build a refinery near Moscow—an installation which would turn
            out products to flow through the Friendship Pipeline.<note n="7" xml:id="d24fn7">Reference is to the pipeline linking the Soviet Union to Eastern European states. The
              sections to East Germany and Poland opened in 1963.</note> We probably will not
            approve this sale, though we know that in all probability one of the Western European
            countries which does not look upon this matter quite as we do will make the sale. What
            purpose is served then, we ask ourselves, by our decision?</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary then described the various obstacles standing in the way of any
            large-scale increase in our trade with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>: the
            Soviets' limited financial reserves, our lack of interest in the items the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has for sale, our established sources of supply for
            most raw materials, the nature of the Soviet trading system which makes bilateral
            exchanges of goods with other countries necessary, our laws which prevent us from
            extending credits to <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, and the Soviet demand for
              <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> treatment.</p>
                    <p>We strongly support the resolution before <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> on
            limiting credits to the Bloc, the Under Secretary went on. He mentioned that we have
            heard a number of stories of negotiations between the British and Bloc countries for as
            much as 12 and 15 year credit terms. We regard such arrangements as unwise.</p>
                    <p>The Minister said that the Federal Government would not guarantee any credits for the
              <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. What would we be guaranteeing, he asked, and
            answered that it would be a guarantee given to West German traders by the Federal
            Government against Soviet aggression directed toward Germany.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary then explained how from a strategic viewpoint it is to the West's
            advantage to see the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> forced to reallocate
            resources from military to non-military uses. We should not make it possible for the
              <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to avoid such reallocations.</p>
                    <p>We look at Eastern Europe somewhat differently, the Under Secretary pointed out. It is
            to our advantage to encourage a movement by these countries from total dependence upon
            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. In this connection, we have looked with favor
            on the actions of the Federal Republic to establish trade missions in many of the
            Eastern European countries. We are a little disturbed, however, over the Federal
            Government's attitude toward Yugoslavia. It would be in our mutual interest to see
            Yugoslavia move further toward the West.</p>
                    <p>The Minister said he generally shares the Under Secretary's opinion about Eastern
            Europe. Opportunities for improving commercial and <pb n="51" xml:id="pg_51" facs="0081"/>other relations with those countries are not great, though. It will be necessary to
            proceed slowly.</p>
                    <p>The Minister then briefly recounted the Pipe Episode,<note n="8" xml:id="d24fn8">The
              Soviets were unable to manufacture pipe of sufficient diameter for the pipeline. Over
                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> objections, Italy sold the Soviets
              pipeline.</note> and concluded by saying that he has taken a very hard line in the
            German Cabinet as far as credits for the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> are
            concerned. If the United States now proceeds to extend five or six year credits to the
              <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, his position will have been made extremely
            difficult.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary said he fully appreciates the Minister's position, and explained
            again why it would be impossible for the US to extend such credits to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Foreign Aid</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary remarked that foreign aid is not his direct responsibility, but he
            has been informed that the Federal Republic's bilateral development lending commitment
            authority was cut to <gloss target="#t_DM1">DM</gloss> 750 million this year and our
            Embassy in Bonn has been advised that no more than a like amount is contemplated for
            1965. The Under Secretary referred to the Federal Republic's strong financial reserve
            position and high level of economic activity, and said that it would seem the Federal
            Republic could finance a considerably larger foreign assistance program.</p>
                    <p>The Minister replied that foreign aid is also the direct responsibility of another
            official in the Federal Republic, but he does participate in the budget discussions of
            the Cabinet. He called <gloss target="#t_DM1">DM</gloss> 60.3 billion “a magic figure”
            at present for the overall budget. For business cycle reasons it is impossible to raise
            that figure now, and, because of a great many internal problems, funds cannot be
            switched among accounts in the budget.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, for 1965 he does not believe the Federal Republic will hold to only
              <gloss target="#t_DM1">DM</gloss> 750 million. There is a budget meeting scheduled for
            next week, and the figure being mentioned for “foreign aid” is <gloss target="#t_DM1">DM</gloss> 1 billion. (The Minister was not clear whether <gloss target="#t_DM1">DM</gloss> 1 billion represents an overall foreign aid allotment, lending commitment
            authority or something else.)</p>
                    <p>The Minister concluded by saying one thing that has been made clear to him as a result
            of his talks in Washington is that the proposals of the <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>'s for achieving large-scale capital transfers by means of rigged prices
            or other devices in the international trade field are illusory. Capital transfers for
            development in excess of the real earning power of the underdeveloped countries will
            have to be made largely through foreign aid channels for some time to come. The Federal
            Republic intends to do its part in this field.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">1965 Munich Exhibition</p>
                    <p>As the meeting was breaking up, the Minister mentioned the 1965 Munich Transportation
            and Communications Exhibition, and asked the Under Secretary to do what he can to assure
            official US participation.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary replied that he is not familiar with the details regarding our
            possible participation—other agencies are primarily concerned with fairs and
            exhibitions—but he will look into the matter.</p>

                    <p>3692. I met last evening (April 10) with Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> for an hour and a half at my request. It was the first opportunity
            for a meeting since my return from the States and his return from an 18 day vacation at
            the Tegernsee.</p>
                    <p>I told the Chancellor of my meeting with President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>
                        <note n="2" xml:id="d25fn2">See <ref target="#d22">Document 22</ref>.</note> and
            conveyed to him the warm greetings the President had sent. I told him the President
            looked forward very much to receiving the Chancellor on June 12 following his acceptance
            of a degree at Harvard. I expressed to him the President's appreciation for having sent
            on to him from time to time, through me, his confidential views on the international
            situation as it had developed. He hoped that the Chancellor would continue to keep him
            advised. He would in turn communicate periodically with him.</p>
                    <p>I expressed the President's particular appreciation for the solid German support of the
              <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, and hoped he had noted in this connection the Sec
            of State's strong reference to the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> in his speech of
            April 7.<note n="3" xml:id="d25fn3">For text, see Department of State Bulletin, April
              27, 1964, pp. 650–655.</note> The President also appreciated the Chancellor's support
            on the <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> Round and looked forward to
            discussing the prospects for success with him in his meeting on June 12, when the
            negotiations in Geneva will have revealed more clearly what some of the obstacles might
            be.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor expressed appreciation for the message I conveyed and said he looked
            forward very much to seeing the President in Washington. <pb n="53" xml:id="pg_53" facs="0083"/>He thereupon raised several questions on a very confidential basis.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. Possible Erhard visit to Russia.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor asked whether or not the possibility of his visiting Russia had been in
            the press prior to my meeting with the President and whether or not this had been
            discussed. I said that it had not, however, the German Government had before that time
            advised us of the suggestion made in the note conveyed to the Chancellor by Ambassador
            Smirnow on March 11 for bilateral German-Soviet discussions.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor said that he would consider a visit to Russia only if there was a good
            chance that something useful could be achieved. The fact that Mr. Adzhubei, <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>'s son-law, had during his recent visit to
              Paris<note n="4" xml:id="d25fn4"> Adzhubei visited France for 2 weeks beginning on
              March 25.</note> made a favorable comment with respect to the Chancellor indicated to
            him that the question of his visit was being discussed in Soviet circles. Alternatively,
            the Chancellor suggested that he was considering the possibility of inviting <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> to visit Germany.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Possible invitation to Nasser to visit Germany.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor said he would like to float, in utmost confidence, another idea that he
            had had, namely, of inviting Nasser to visit Germany. He commented on the forthcoming
            non-aligned conference<note n="5" xml:id="d25fn5">The conference was held in Cairo
              November 28–December 5.</note> (at which it is anticipated that a determined attempt
            will be made by the Bloc to get various neutral nations to recognize the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>). He confirmed that his interest stemmed largely from
            Nasser's strong position in this group as it might be related to the recognition issue.
            In discussing the possibility of Germany having a constructive influence on Nasser, the
            Chancellor commented that the Germans had never fought the Arabs and had, he believed, a
            considerable reservoir of good will in the Arab states.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor said the Israeli Prime Minister, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>, had also suggested the possibility of a visit to Germany, however,
            this was not possible since Germany and Israel do not recognize each other. He had,
            however, met with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> privately and
            secretly at various times and <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> was pressing
            for a meeting during his visit to the States, which it might be difficult for him to
            avoid. If he decided to invite Nasser, he would therefore like to get his invitation off
            before his visit to the States. The Chancellor said he thought he could, in the light of
            what the German Government had done for Israel, get by with the Nasser visit without too
            much strain on German-Israeli relations. He commented that if Nasser visited here it
            would probably be expensive for the Germans, however, this did not seem to trouble him.
            I suggested that he should consider the attitudes of the other Arab states who might be
            at odds with Nasser. He <pb n="54" xml:id="pg_54" facs="0084"/>said all of this was
            being given careful study by the Foreign Office, however, he would welcome our own
            reaction.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. Economic aid to the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor raised again, on his own initiative, the question of possible large
            scale economic aid to the Soviets. He said that he hoped we would continue to follow the
            scene closely and would tell him if and when we saw some opportunity for Germany to
            achieve important political gains on the all-German problem in return for economic aid.
            When I queried him as to whether the recent German commitment to provide an additional
            400,000 tons of fertilizer to the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> under interzonal
            trade represented a beginning of what he had in mind, he shrugged this off as being more
            or less inconsequential. I advised him that up until now we had not been able, after
            careful analysis, to discern in the present situation an opportunity for such a move.
            However, we would continue to follow it closely.</p>
                    <p>Comment: We will in a separate following telegram<note n="6" xml:id="d25fn6">Telegram

            a visit by the Chancellor to Moscow or by <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> to Bonn. There is no evidence, of course, of a firm Soviet
            invitation, however, Erhard appears to believe one would be available. We have in our

                    <p>We are unable to assess here the full consequences of an invitation to Nasser.
            Obviously, the Chancellor conceives of it largely as a continuation of the Hallstein
            Doctrine. It is possible, however, that he may see it as an opportunity to provide an

            convinced that the German proposals were inadequate for an initiative to the Soviet
            Union by the three Western powers. He said that Bonn was not prepared to add anything to
            the proposals either on Berlin or in the field of European security. On the former, Bonn
            was afraid that the Soviets would concentrate on Berlin and relegate reunification of
            Germany to the background, as had been the case in Geneva in 1959. On the latter, Bonn
            was not prepared to commit itself to any specific security measures at this stage. The
            result was that the proposals would be hopelessly thin in so far as the Russians were
            concerned, and unconvincing to Western public opinion. He said he was going to recommend
            to Bonn that the German initiative take the form of a manifesto on German reunification,
            which the Western powers could support, but which would not constitute an actual
            proposal for negotiation.</p>

                    <p>Dear Mr. Chairman:</p>
                    <p>I welcome your letter of April 2, 1964,<note n="2" xml:id="d27fn2">The letter is
              scheduled for publication in <ref target="frus1964-68v14">

            because of the spirit in which it was written. It is certainly incumbent upon both of us
            to do anything we can to strengthen our relations and to prevent incidents which could
            adversely affect those relations.</p>
                    <p>I found your letter particularly interesting because it seems to me it so clearly
            illustrates the ease with which misunderstandings can arise. You referred to the
            incidents on the autobahn which occurred last October.<note n="3" xml:id="d27fn3">East
              German authorities stopped and delayed U.S. truck convoys heading to Berlin on
              November 1 and 5, 1963. For texts of the U.S. and Soviet statements regarding East
              German actions, see American Foreign Policy: Current Documents, 1963, pp.
              548–555.</note> Our investigation showed that in the six months preceding these
            incidents, eighteen convoys with a configuration similar to those that were stopped were
            processed through your checkpoints without dismounting and without difficulty, except in
            the case of two which were delayed for short periods of time. It was, therefore, most
            natural for us to consider that it was your side that had changed procedures. But I am
            happy that this matter has now been resolved, and trust that there will be no further
            difficulties.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the airplane incidents, I can quite well understand your concern that
            within a short period of time two American airplanes crossed the demarcation line. There
            is little I can say about the incident involving a training plane, since the crew were
            killed and we are unable to ascertain what actually happened. I am disturbed that in
            both cases, however, there does not appear to have been justification for the rapidity
            with which there was a resort to force by Soviet planes. The American planes should not
            have been there, but I believe that this fast and violent reaction is quite unjustified.
            Avoidable acts of force which can bring death in peacetime do not contribute to an
            improvement of our relations. All of our pilots have long had rigid instructions that if
            by error they found themselves in Eastern Germany, they should promptly obey signals to
            land.</p>
                    <p>The RB–66 was on a training flight from Toul Rosieres in France and was scheduled to
            pass over Hahn, Dortmund and Nordholz in Germany at high level, to descend to low
            altitude over Hamburg for a photographic <pb n="57" xml:id="pg_57" facs="0087"/>exercise, and to return to high altitude on the return trip to its base. It is normal
            for planes on missions of this kind to test the cameras en route to see that they are in
            working order, but to use them only for the assigned mission. A thorough investigation
            has shown that the compass was faulty and that through a series of errors, adequate
            further checks of position were not made. Our Air Force has had procedures to prevent
            incidents of this kind, and when our radar station detected an unknown plane proceeding
            toward East Germany, the plane was ordered to turn back. The instructor navigator states
            he heard this instruction but says he thought that he was over Nordholz at the time and
            that the signal did not apply to him. Appropriate steps are being taken to deal with
            those responsible for the errors made.</p>
                    <p>From the debriefing of the crew, we can find no basis for the conclusion that “the crew
            knew exactly where it was.” I was particularly interested in your statement that you had
            received information, according to which the American command in Europe intended to
            continue reconnaissance flights over Eastern Germany. I should be glad to have any
            additional information bearing on this statement. From our own most thorough
            investigation, I am convinced that any suspicion that this violation was a deliberate
            provocation is unfounded. I recognize that this is an astonishing series of errors, and
            upon my instructions the American military authorities have established the most
            rigorous procedures possible in order to prevent any repetition of such an incident.</p>
                    <p>I think it most important that we deal with each other frankly in matters of this kind.
            I shall be glad to cooperate with you in reducing tension in this most sensitive area of
            the world. In this connection, may I tell you that I have been disturbed that the East
            German press has for some time been carrying on a campaign of accusations of alleged
            violations of traffic regulations by our military vehicles in East Berlin. After most
            careful investigation, it appears that, with rare exceptions relating to quite
            accidental episodes, these allegations have no basis in fact. I was, therefore,
            disturbed when your military authorities protested to ours on the basis of these
            allegations. For my part, I have given renewed instructions that our military vehicles
            take every precaution to avoid any incident in the future, and I hope that your own
            authorities will carefully investigate and establish, to your own satisfaction, whether
            or not East German allegations of this kind are well-founded.</p>

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> handed the Secretary a
            report of a conversation between Foreign Secretary Butler and Foreign Minister Schroeder
            on the above subject.<note n="2" xml:id="d28fn2">Not found.</note> After reading the
            report the Secretary asked whether Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName>'s memorandum of April 21 on this same subject2 would need any
            revision. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> thought not and
            said that, as he had pointed out in his memo, there are two conflicting objectives in
            the present circumstances. One of these is to attempt to bring about bona fide
            negotiations on the Berlin and German problems through use of the German paper. He said
            he thought it absurd <pb n="59" xml:id="pg_59" facs="0089"/>to think we could surface
            the German paper as a negotiating proposal without blowing the Soviets out of the water.
            To do so would raise holy hell in East Germany for the Soviets would have to come back
            with an East German paper at the least, and might even feel forced to take some action,
            perhaps even to sign a separate peace treaty. It is a question of either wanting
            negotiations, in which case the way to get them would be not to surface the paper, or of
            not wanting negotiations, in which case you could go ahead with the initiative in as
            innocuous a way as possible. But you couldn't have it both ways.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that, in other words, we might get back to where we were in the
            summer of 1961 without there being any point to it. He wondered if it were really true
            that there is an erosion of the position on reunification by not doing anything about
            it. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> thought that it is true that, as
            Schroeder had said in his talk with Butler, if we don't talk about reunification it
            would just melt away like ice.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> said that the status in the
            Ambassadorial Group of the German initiative is that we have asked the Germans to list
            in the European security section elements from the 1959 plan rather than just mention
            that plan. He said he took it from the Schroeder/Butler conversation that the answer was
            going to be that the Germans would not do so. Minister Lilienfeld had said only a week
            ago that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> prefers a German paper, but, again,
            from the Schroeder/Butler conversation, it seems that Schroeder wants an Allied paper.
            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> expressed his apprehension
            that we should get tied to an Allied paper at the present time through the current
            exercise. He said he had agreed that at the working level we would consider a <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> draft for an Allied paper based on an amalgam of the German
            paper and the Principles Paper.<note n="3" xml:id="d28fn3">For text of this U.S. paper,
              which was prepared in March 1962 and handed to Soviet Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> at Geneva, see <ref target="frus1961-63v15#d20">
                                <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1961–1963, vol. XV, Document
              20</ref>.</note> But he had made it clear that there could be no US/<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> paper.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked what is next. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> replied that Lord Harlech was scheduled to see the Secretary
            tomorrow, April 22, and that <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName> was coming in
            on Monday, April 27. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> said
            that if the Germans press for action now, we could have an Ambassadorial Group meeting
            in order to hear the German answers to the questions we had put to them at the last
            meeting.</p>
                    <p>Referring again to the Schroeder/Butler conversation, the Secretary noted that
            Schroeder had pooh-poohed the idea that the 1965 elections had anything to do with the
            German initiative and asked whether Schroeder had been dissimulating with Butler on the
            amount of pressure in Germany for an initiative. He noted that we had been led to
            believe for the past several months that there was considerable pressure, particularly
            among the youth. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> thought that Schroeder
            had not been utterly <pb n="60" xml:id="pg_60" facs="0090"/>candid with Butler, for all
            the indications are that there is a considerable amount of pressure for some movement on
            reunification. The Secretary then asked whether there wasn't more to an Erhard visit
            with <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> than Schroeder had indicated
            there might be to Butler. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> thought that
            there was, because the FRG seems to be very concerned about the possibility that Brandt
            might get to see <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> first. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> thought that if Erhard could get <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> to come to West Germany it would be a big plus
            for Erhard. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRC1">Creel</persName> added that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> thinks Brandt got a leg up from his invitation to visit
              <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> in East Berlin even though the visit
            had not come off. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> thought it would be
            very difficult for <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> to go to the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> in light of his constant reference to revanchists, etc.,
            there.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> then asked whether the
            Secretary had seen the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> response to the Soviet <gloss target="#t_TASS1">TASS</gloss> statement,<note n="4" xml:id="d28fn4">For text of the
                <gloss target="#t_TASS1">TASS</gloss> statement, see Current Digest of the Soviet

              Europa Archiv, 1964, vol. 2, pp. 251–258.</note> pointing out that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> statement was very strong and well written. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRC1">Creel</persName> noted that the Soviets had followed the <gloss target="#t_TASS1">TASS</gloss> statement up in a relatively mild manner and in fact
            had, through Smirnov in Bonn, hinted at the possibility of bilateral talks.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> said that he was bothered by the fact
            that Schroeder was not bothered by putting forward proposals to the Soviets that could
            not possibly be accepted as a basis for negotiations. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRC1">Creel</persName> observed that Schroeder recognizes that the present paper is no
            basis for negotiation but nevertheless feels he must take a step that would be viewed as
            progress or at least motion on the subject of reunification.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> wondered whether we couldn't
            help the Germans out by having <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> make a statement on
            reunification which nevertheless could be attributed to the Germans. He pointed out that
            the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> paper does include the idea of a Four-Power
            Council and feared that if the Soviets rejected the German paper, or any initiative
            based on it, then the Four-Power Council idea would be virtually killed, since it would
            be much harder for the Soviets to accept it once they had rejected it in a paper in
            which it is the principal point of substance.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked whether the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> is really
            determined to keep open the question of the Oder-Neisse territories. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> noted that certain Germans, for example, Carlo
              Schmid,<note n="5" xml:id="d28fn5">
                            <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> Vice President of the Bundestag.</note> as late as
            four or five years ago, had talked about recovering the Oder-Neisse territories but that
            they do not do so any longer. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRC1">Creel</persName> pointed
            out that, regardless of what individual politicians think, this subject will not be
            frankly discussed before the 1965 elections. The Secretary said that the more the <pb n="61" xml:id="pg_61" facs="0091"/>Germans talked about the Oder-Neisse line in the
            context of reunification, the more they push into the open the question of reunification
            of what. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> agreed that the way the
            Oder-Neisse territory was dealt with in the German initiative was one of its major
            defects and said that this point plus a lack of forthcomingness on European security
            were really the points that made the German paper not a proper basis for
            negotiation.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> then elaborated his idea that perhaps
            the German paper could be turned into a unilateral German manifesto. It would be a
            solemn governmental statement drafted so as not to require the Soviets to respond as to
            an invitation to negotiation. The Three Powers could then associate themselves with this
            German statement. When he had floated this idea informally with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName>, the latter had said he thought the manifesto
            idea offered the best solution. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> thought
            that Knappstein probably had been reprimanded in Bonn for voicing such an heretical
            idea. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRC1">Creel</persName> pointed out that, even if the
            German initiative were converted into a manifesto, we would nevertheless probably have
            to indicate our willingness to participate in the Four-Power Council.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> suggested that in the
            Secretary's conversations with Harlech and Butler he should say that we do not see that
            we will be able to bring about negotiations with the Soviets by means of pursuing the
            initiative suggested by the Germans. Proposals for negotiations are just not appropriate
            now. The Secretary said he assumed that the French would be of like mind, and Ambassador
              <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> replied that the French would probably
            object to things in the paper on European security and nondissemination. The Secretary
            remarked that Couve continues to be receptive to the nondissemination but does not think
            the Soviets will be receptive because of the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that, if the problem is really one internal to the Federal Republic,
            the solution to our problem may be a speech by Schroe-der or Erhard. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> pointed out that Schroeder had already made such a
            speech at Munich. Schroeder had gone deeply into the question of reunification and its
            meaning for Germans. The Secretary asked whether we were supposed to react to that
            speech, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRC1">Creel</persName> pointed out that in the
            letter from him to Schroeder on <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>-Yugoslav relations
            we had added a sentence commenting favorably about the speech.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> asked if it was true that
            Schroeder seemed to be backing away from the initiative idea. He thought he had seen an
            intelligence report to the effect that the Germans don't think an initiative is such a
            good wicket to be on now. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> thought he
            had seen such a report. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRC1">Creel</persName> pointed out
            that something on this point might emerge from the German Chiefs of Missions meeting now
            going on in the Bonn Foreign Office. The Secretary said that it seems to him that the
            Federal <pb n="62" xml:id="pg_62" facs="0092"/>Republic wants us not to have any truck
            with the Soviets except on reunification, even though they, the Germans, might have any
            connections with the Soviets they want. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> said that so far as the initiative is concerned the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> wants to develop a package from which no part can be
            removed by the Soviets and pocketed. They are particularly sensitive to the inclusion of
            anything on access for this reason. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName>
            recalled that Schroeder had, however, said to Butler that difficulties about the
            International Access Authority are not insurmountable. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> pointed out that certain portions of the German
            paper, that is those on Heimatrecht, had been removed at our request.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> suggested that perhaps the Secretary
            could see Schroeder in Miami. He thought that while Schroeder had not been willing to
            see Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> or himself, Schroeder
            might be willing to see the Secretary. The Secretary said that he gathered that
            Schroeder does not expect anything to happen on this subject before The Hague meeting.
            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> pointed out, however, that
            Schroeder, according to <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName>'s report of their
            conversation, was giving a slightly different impression. He thought we should see
            Knappstein as soon as he gets back this weekend. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> added that he thought it would be desirable for us to see Knappstein
            before the Secretary sees Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName> and thought
            we should see Knappstein Saturday morning. The Secretary wondered whether we shouldn't
            have a tripartite talk with the French and British before leveling with the Germans.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> thought that Schroeder had
            missed the point in saying that we cannot do anything because it is quiet now in Berlin.
            The reasons why we are not now in a position to make progress on reunification by a
            diplomatic proposal are that the Soviets are having troubles on the one hand and the US
            and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> are having elections on the other. The Secretary
            asked whether there is any reason why the Federal Republic cannot wait until after the
            elections to launch their initiative. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName>
            in response expressed the view that the Germans are very sensitive to this action now.
            They feel they have lost ground in their stance on relations with East Germany both in
            the case of Ceylon and Zanzibar. They continue to feel that Yugoslavia is moving with
            the nonaligned countries to get them to recognize East Germany. They feel that there is
            a political deterioration in the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> in relation to its
              <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> policy that can only be stopped by a move on
            reunification.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> to elaborate on
            what he had in mind by a manifesto. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName>
            said that the principal thing was that it would be a statement by the Federal German
            Government in which it would be clear that no action is being taken, so that the Soviets
            would not feel compelled to take counteraction.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked that he be provided with a full text of Schroe-der's speech.</p>
                    <pb n="63" xml:id="pg_63" facs="0093"/>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> reverted to the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> declaration suggestion he had made earlier. Mr.
              <persName corresp="#p_CRC1">Creel</persName> pointed out that for the Germans this
            would probably not be acceptable, since a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
            declaration would presumably not mention a Four-Power Council, which is the key
            provision of the German paper.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> said that the thing to say
            to the British, as he had done himself already to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GDA1">Greenhill</persName>, is that if you want a Four-Power Council you should do
            something to get it in a separate, unpublished approach to the Soviets. You should not
            try to get it by using a paper that the Soviets would feel compelled to shoot down. The
            Secretary said that that was what the French had been saying for some time. He said he
            would see what Harlech has to say and indicated that he thought that this German
            initiative question would be the main basis at The Hague Quadripartite meeting. He
            wondered whether we should draft and put forward some language for the European security
            section. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> advised against
            doing so, since the Germans would only be frightened and only harm could come from
            it.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary noted with some resignation that he had been trying to get Berlin and
            Germany off the front pages for over three years and now that we had succeeded the
            Germans seem to want to put it back. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName>
            said that that was the position in a nutshell. He said he was worried that a serious
            negotiation proposal at a time when we know the Soviets are not receptive to one can
            only be dangerous. For this reason he thought that the Germans should confine their
            initiative to the level of a manifesto, as he had outlined.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> continued, saying that he does not
            like drifting toward being associated with unworthy proposals for fear of saying no to
            the Germans. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> thought that
            what the Germans are really doing was gauging our intentions with respect to
            reunification. He noted that the French and British have made it clear that they do not
            want it. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that he felt that unless
            something really useful could come from the present exercise we should not be afraid to
            say “no” to the Germans. We should stick to what we think is the right course. He
            thought there was no reason for us, with such serious consequences possible, to help the
            Germans in domestic matters.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked whether we had ever said anything concrete about what we wanted by
            way of disposition of the Oder-Neisse Territories. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> felt that our position was more implicit in what we had said than by
            precise statements. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRC1">Creel</persName> said it was much
            clearer, in statements made by our government at Potsdam, that we would recognize the
            Soviet and Polish claims to the former East Prussian territory than what we had in mind
            for the territory immediately east of the Oder-Neisse rivers. He undertook to report
            further on what is a matter of rec-ord <pb n="64" xml:id="pg_64" facs="0094"/>reflecting
            the American viewpoint of the disposition of this territory.<note n="6" xml:id="d28fn6">An unsigned April 23 memorandum attached to the source text reads: “RHD sent the

                        <item>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GDA1">Greenhill</persName>, Minister</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>Lord Harlech opened the discussion by saying that there were five alternatives under
            consideration: 1) for the Allies to propose creation of a Four Power Council and then
            let the Germans publish their paper; 2) for the Germans to publish their paper and the
            Three Powers to support it; 3) for the Germans to advance their proposal to the Four
            Powers; 4) for the US, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and France to advance a
            tripartite paper to the Soviets; and 5) to do nothing. It looked doubtful that it would
            be possible to reach agreement on a tripartite paper which looked like a serious
            negotiating proposal. The British had not been encouraged in this regard by the
            Butler/Schroeder talks in Brussels. One possibility, therefore, was to let the Germans
            publish their paper and for the Three Western Powers to support it publicly. If,
            however, we want at this time to get into discussions <pb n="65" xml:id="pg_65" facs="0095"/>with the Soviets on Germany, we might let the Germans publish and then
            the US get together with the Soviets and suggest that they get their bilateral talks
            going again. The purpose of these talks would be to bring discussions back around to the
            questions raised in the US Principles Paper.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> said that German Minister
            Lilienfeld had just been in to tell him about a talk with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName>, who is in Bonn.<note n="2" xml:id="d29fn2">A
              memorandum of the April 22 conversation is ibid.</note>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName> reportedly said that Bonn has now
            decided that it would like a Three Power initiative. This had upset the German Embassy,
            which had come around to the point of view that a German proposal would be best. When
            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> asked Lilienfeld if he
            thought the French would go along with this, Lilienfeld did not reply. Ambassador
              <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> went on to say that with regard to the
            British proposal for us to follow up on a German paper, he thought this would not work,
            because the Soviets would have to refuse to talk under these circumstances.</p>
                    <p>Lord Harlech said he had come to the conclusion we would have to let the Germans run
            into a brick wall in order to let them learn what they are dealing with.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> said he told Lilienfeld we
            could understand the German desire to take an initiative on German unity but that he
            felt this was inconsistent with a desire for negotiations with the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>Lord Harlech said the Germans were in a dilemma. They were not prepared to make
            negotiable proposals but at the same time were not prepared to talk on peripheral
            issues. They either had to make a meaningful move on German unity or make one of the
            kind they now have in mind and run into a stone wall.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> said he thought the best
            thing would be to let them surface their proposal as a German declaration or as a note
            to the Four Powers. We would then have to expect the Soviets to blast off and allow some
            time to pass before we made any new proposals for negotiations.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary remarked that he was not quite sure what the Germans were after. He had
            noted that they didn't want us to come to Miami to talk to Schroeder.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> said he thought Schroeder was caught
            between his role as Foreign Minister and domestic pressures on him.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> had the
            impression that domestic issues weighed heavily with Schroeder,<note n="3" xml:id="d29fn3">
                            <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> reported on domestic considerations
              weighing on Schroeder in telegram 3263 from Bonn, March 12. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 32–1 <gloss target="#t_GER1">GER</gloss>)</note>
            despite what Schroe-der <pb n="66" xml:id="pg_66" facs="0096"/>said to Butler to the
            contrary in Brussels. The Secretary asked if we knew who was working on this problem in
            the Foreign Office in Bonn. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName>
            said he was sure Carstens was involved and noted that their leading Soviet expert,
            Reinkemeyer, had recently died.</p>
                    <p>Lord Harlech said he thought the best thing now to do was to suggest that the Germans
            get in touch with the French.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he had discussed this question briefly with Couve in Manila,<note n="4" xml:id="d29fn4">During the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> meeting April
              13–15. A memorandum of conversation is ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 32–4
                <gloss target="#t_GER1">GER</gloss>.</note> who said the German idea was not a good
            one but didn't quite know how to say no. The Secretary added that he has been trying for
            several years to get Berlin and Germany off the front pages. In a certain sense we have
            been successful and have what might be called a modus vivendi regarding Berlin. Now the
            Germans want to put it back on.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> remarked that a modus vivendi on
            Berlin was all right with the Germans but not a modus vivendi on Germany. They didn't
            want a repetition of 1959, when Germany was discussed for about a day and then the rest
            of the conference was devoted to Berlin.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said if we put the heat on the Soviets now on Germany and they respond in
            the way they have to, we may find ourselves in the ironic position of trying to get
            ourselves back to the situation in which we now find ourselves, where things are quiet
            on Berlin and Germany.</p>
                    <p>Lord Harlech said it's hard to go further until we know more about the new German
            position and the French reaction. He had the impression that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> feels that now is not a good time to make a move
            on Germany.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> replied that he felt this
            strongly because of the situation in which the Soviets find themselves. The East Germans
            are pressing the Soviets for action on Germany and Berlin and an initiative on our part
            might only play into their hands. He added that he thought we should now try to move
            things back toward a German paper, which we make favorable noises about and which the
            Soviets recognize as propaganda.</p>
                    <p>Lord Harlech said he thought Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName>'s
            preoccupation in talking with the Secretary would be to try to make something out of the
            proposal for a German initiative and to get negotiations going with the Soviets such as
            regarding a Four Power Council. The Secretary noted that this would take a major change
            in the French attitude. Lord Harlech agreed.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> noted that the French are at
            present on board on a German proposal but won't remain there if the discussion shifts to
            a Three Power paper.</p>
                    <pb n="67" xml:id="pg_67" facs="0097"/>
                    <p>The Secretary asked if the Germans had tried to inject into their trade discussions
            with other East European countries the question of German unity. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> replied that we didn't really know. The Secretary
            noted that the Germans didn't want us to deal with East European countries without
            pressing the case for German unification, although they apparently do.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he considered the absence of European security provisions in the
            German paper a fatal flaw. If someone, such as the Germans, wants to speak his piece
            without discussion of European security, the question is how to do this with the least
            harm.</p>
                    <p>Lord Harlech said unless we could get a tripartite paper which goes far beyond the
            present German paper, he thought the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would prefer a
            German paper. The situation would now have to be re-evaluated, however, in light of the
            new German position. He thought that <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName> would
            still prefer to let the Germans publish their proposals and have the US get in touch
            with the Soviets bilaterally about a Four Power Council to discuss the questions covered
            in the Principles Paper.<note n="5" xml:id="d29fn5">See <ref target="#d28fn4">footnote
                4, Document 28</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked why Schroeder had declined to see anyone in Miami. Ambassador
              <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> replied he thought he was probably
            tagged as a black devil in the Ambassadorial Group for raising so many questions about
            the German paper. He thought, however, that Schroeder was probably still thrashing
            around and not yet prepared to talk to anyone.</p>
                    <p>Lord Harlech asked when Schroeder would get back to Bonn. The Secretary said he thought
            he wouldn't get back until just before the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
              meeting.<note n="6" xml:id="d29fn6">April 24–May 15.</note> Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> added that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName> would return to Washington next Wednesday. The Secretary
            remarked that it appeared that no one on the German side was terribly steamed up about
            their initiative.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GDA1">Greenhill</persName> said that the Ambassadorial Group
            could finish up a German paper pretty quickly now.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he thought the Foreign Ministers should discuss at The Hague the
            question—if the Soviets are quiet in Europe because they have their hands full, is it a
            good time to press them?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> remarked that the Germans are not
            under the impression that the Soviets are going to be forthcoming. They are preparing
            for action on German unity because they feel that the Hallstein doctrine is slipping and
            because they are under public pressure to do something.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said we have been eroding the Soviet position on a separate peace treaty
            and settlement of the Berlin question on that basis and <pb n="68" xml:id="pg_68" facs="0098"/>were much better off than we were in 1961. He recognized that little had
            been accomplished in this time on German unification, but not much had been accomplished
            on it before either. He then asked Lord Harlech if Butler believes discussions at this
            time with the Soviets would be useful. Lord Harlech replied he thought that Butler did.
            The Foreign Office has always taken the line that if there is no pressure on Berlin, it
            is a good time to discuss with the Soviets a possible modus vivendi. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> remarked that we now have a de facto modus vivendi.
            The question was, would talking to the Soviets make it more solid?</p>
                    <p>The Secretary remarked to Lord Harlech that he was sorry we had no particular bright
            ideas at this point. Lord Harlech agreed that the situation was a bit murky.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>Without over-dramatizing any particular piece of information, it seems increasingly
            clear that Schroeder is not as much in control of Germany's foreign policy as we
            expected or he hoped he would be after Adenauer's exit. In fact, under continuous attack
            from the right (Adenauer, Strauss, Krone, et al), distrusted by segments of his own
            party, lacking <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s full support, having no
            personal political following, and losing foreign policy initiatives to Willy Brandt,
            Schroeder's performance for the past months has been halting, ragged and unimpressive.
            He seems less confident, more intimidated and increasingly concerned about his political
            future than during the last days of the Adenauer government or even the <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> visit to Texas.</p>
                    <pb n="69" xml:id="pg_69" facs="0099"/>
                    <p>Going from the general to the specific—Schroeder went off skiing when the pass issue
            reached a critical point; he seemed perplexed and a little annoyed by the Secretary's
            expression of concern at Germany's relations with Yugoslavia; he turned down a
            suggestion that <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> discuss with him—during a Miami stop-over next
            week—the knotty German reunification plan; and now according to <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> (see attached)<note n="2" xml:id="d30fn2">Telegram 3824 from Bonn, April 22, not printed.</note> he insists that this plan,
            despite its problems, be submitted to the Soviets as a Western opus “for German internal
            political reasons” and expects four-power agreement on this when the Foreign Ministers
            meet at The Hague in mid-May.</p>
                    <p>The German proposal in its present form is not only uninteresting and unsatisfactory;
            as a Western initiative, it would be the wrong kind of proposal, in the wrong form, at
            the wrong time. It has nothing of interest to the Soviets and there is nothing to
            indicate that the Soviets would be receptive to such a gesture. Its potential mileage is
            absolutely zero. And despite this, Bonn has been unyielding in insisting that the plan
            had to remain substantially intact as now constituted.</p>
                    <p>We cannot push the reunification plan aside so long as the Germans insist upon it.
            However, despite Schroeder's apparent reluctance to handle this as a German creation
            with allied endorsement—that in effect says this is a worthy cause which we are prepared
            to consider sympathetically—this in fact seems to me the only way we can deal with it.
            As an allied proposal, it makes almost no sense. As a German product, we could pass it
            off as a Bonn initiative, sympathetically supported by the allies, which the Soviets, in
            turn, could treat for what it was worth.</p>
                    <p>In any event, this is an issue to which we are going to have to face up in the next
            weeks and some decisions will be necessary.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LG3">Von Lilienfeld</persName> came in at his request. He
            distributed a message dated April 24, 1964 from Foreign Minister Schroeder to Secretary
              <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> stating that the Federal Republic has come
            to the conclusion that an approach to the Soviets on the German question should be a
            collective step by the Three Powers and not a German initiative supported by the Three
            Powers. (The Foreign Minister's message in translation is attached.)<note n="2" xml:id="d31fn2">The message, dated April 24, is not printed.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LG3">Von Lilienfeld</persName> commented that the Foreign
            Minister had come to this conclusion only after considerable discussion within the
            German Government. The Foreign Minister had decided that it would be preferable to have
            full identification of the Federal Republic's allies with any peace initiative. The
            Foreign Minister had been concerned that the press might misconstrue a unilateral German
            initiative as lacking allied support. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LG3">Von
              Lilienfeld</persName> added that Foreign Minister Schroeder hopes that the
            Ambassadorial Group can develop a satisfactory paper, perhaps within six to eight weeks.
            The Foreign Minister will want to talk to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> about this at The Hague.</p>
                    <p>Regarding the content of an allied initiative, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LG3">Von
              Lilienfeld</persName> said the Germans realize that more will have to be put into the
            paper than would be included in a purely German initiative.</p>
                    <p>According to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LG3">Von Lilienfeld</persName>, Foreign Minister
            Schroeder was also mindful of the US elections. The Foreign Minister felt, however, that
            an allied initiative could be explained to the press as a restatement of the US attitude
            on the German question and not as a sensational new initiative. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LG3">Von Lilienfeld</persName> added that the Foreign Minister thinks the
            French <pb n="71" xml:id="pg_71" facs="0101"/>will come along, once the importance to
            the Federal Republic of this initiative is made clear and when the French appreciate
            that the US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> fully support it.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said that if the allies make a
            proposal along these lines to the Soviets, the Soviets might come back and say they have
            already made clear their position that there should be a peace settlement on the basis
            that there are two Germanies. The Soviets might then propose that both the allied
            proposal and the Soviet position be discussed. The Secretary asked whether the Federal
            Republic would be willing to see discussions with the Soviets conducted on that basis.
            He said the same problem would apply to the French. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LG3">Von
              Lilienfeld</persName> said he did not know the answer to this question.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary commented that a number of far-reaching questions are involved, such as
            European security; it is essential to have clear positions on these matters. Mr.
              <persName corresp="#p_LG3">Von Lilienfeld</persName> suggested that it might be useful
            to work out the various points that should be included in an allied initiative and
            devise language to cover them.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> commented that further
            consideration of the German proposal will in any case smoke out positions on the
            Oder-Neisse line.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary concluded that he would be talking to <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
            Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName> about this general
            subject in the next few days and that he would look forward to seeing Foreign Minister
            Schroeder at The Hague.</p>

            The Secretary then gave him the following five points:</p>
                    <p>1. What is our primary objective to be—to bring about negotiations with the Soviets or
            to keep attention focused on German unification?</p>
                    <p>2. If it is to bring about negotiations, are the Germans (and French) prepared to make
            important additions to the German draft?</p>
                    <p>3. When would the Federal Government propose that a tripartite proposal for
            negotiations be made to the Soviets?</p>
                    <p>4. How are the Soviets likely to respond to a tripartite proposal and how would the
            Federal Government propose that we meet this response?</p>
                    <p>5. Electoral problems—U.S., <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and Germany.</p>
                    <p>This was followed by a general discussion of how the initiative should be handled and
            its prospects, covering the same ground gone over the previous day.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName> said he would leave to us the
            question of Erhard going to Moscow. The Secretary said we would not want to make too
            much of a point of this with Schroeder. We wouldn't want the Germans to think we were
            pressing.</p>

                    <p>On April 18, 1964, President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> granted an
            interview to the German magazine, Quick. The interview together with a photo spread on
            the President was published in the May 3 edition (pages 8–12, 138–142). The President's
            comment that he had told Chancellor Erhard to put himself in the Soviets' shoes when
            dealing with West German-Soviet relations generated considerable press commentary in
            Germany. The President responded to a reporter's question regarding the remark at his
            May 6 press conference. For text of the <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>

                    <p>Commenting on the controversy, Bundy wrote President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>: “There is nothing wrong with the statement as a statement,
            particularly here in Washington. In Germany it carries a little different connotation
            and is bound to have some boomeranging effect, particularly with Germany's almost
            paranoic concern about the ramifications of our contacts with the Soviets.” (Memorandum

                    <p>Dear Mr. Chancellor:</p>

            material for military purposes,<note n="2" xml:id="d34fn2">Seven communications

I am
            most anxious that my correspondence with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> remain entirely confidential, but Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>
                        <pb n="74" xml:id="pg_74" facs="0104"/>raised matters directly concerning your country
            and I want you to know in the strictest confidence what he has said and what I have said
            in reply.</p>
                    <p>In a letter to me in the middle of April, after a discussion of our separate decisions
            to cut back in the production of fissionable material, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> turned to the subject of our troops in Europe, in the following
            passage:</p>
                    <p>“This is not a disarmament measure. However the very fact that we have succeeded in
            undertaking certain practical steps as a matter of mutual example—I have in mind both
            the present agreement and mutual reduction of military budgets—shows that this approach
            can also be applied beneficially in a number of other instances.</p>
                    <p>“Why, for example, do we not attempt to agree in the same manner on the reduction of
            foreign troops on others' territories? I am familiar with the declarations to the effect
            that the U.S.A. intends to withdraw from Western Germany 7,500 soldiers and officers
            transferred there additionally in 1961. We welcome this step of yours. If you would be
            prepared to go farther and proceed to the reduction of those American troops which are
            permanently stationed on the territory of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, then
            I can say right now: we in that case will also be prepared to reduce our troops
            stationed on the territory of the German Democratic Republic with the provision,
            naturally, that the reduction of your troops would not be compensated by the further
            increase in the number of the armed forces of the Federal Republic of Germany itself. It
            is no secret that recently the West German Bundeswehr is swelling quickly. Your Minister
            of Defense declared recently that the number of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
            troops in Europe already exceeds the number of troops of the countries of the Warsaw
            Pact and we understand that this on the whole is directly connected with the rapid
            growth of the West German Army. All this we must naturally take into consideration.</p>
                    <p>“I would be happy to know your views on this score.”</p>
                    <p>From time to time in other messages, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> had commented on similar matters in a more general way and I
            had made no comment in my replies, but the rather specific character of the remarks I
            have just quoted led me to make the following comment in my answering message:</p>
                    <p>“You refer to the problem of the reduction of troop levels, especially in Germany. I am
            sorry to have to tell you that I do not think this subject is one on which we can expect
            to make progress by private discussion between us at this time. The American forces in
            Germany are there for entirely defensive purposes, and their presence is a matter of
            great importance for the people and government of West Germany. For there to be any
            substantial additional reduction in the level of the U.S. forces in Germany there would
            have to be changes in the situation which would make it possible for the Germans and
            others in Western Europe to feel <pb n="75" xml:id="pg_75" facs="0105"/>secure in other
            ways. In the meanwhile, I hope we can continue to cooperate in reducing the level of
            tension in Central Europe.</p>
                    <p>“The problem of the future of Germany is a most important one, and nothing could be
            better for the peace of the world than a real settlement. We on our side remain ready
            for such a settlement, which could serve the legitimate interests of the German people
            as well as the other peoples involved, including your own.”</p>
                    <p>I have had no further comment from the Chairman on this matter, and I assume that he
            will understand from what I have said that the United States is not interested in making
            arrangements about Germany that do not take full account of the interests of the German
            people, and of the Federal Republic in particular. It remains true, as you know from our
            talks in Texas,<note n="3" xml:id="d34fn3">December 28–29, 1963. For documentation, see

            want you to know exactly what the Chairman recently suggested and how I have dealt with
            it.</p>
                    <p>If you have any views to express on these matters, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> will report them to me most privately. Let me
            merely repeat in closing that the privacy of these exchanges with Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> is a matter of the greatest importance to me,
            and that I therefore hope that this message may be treated as a matter entirely between
            the two of us.</p>

            my meeting with him today, raised with me a question which he said was of great
            importance. He hoped that I would convey his views to the President before Secretary
              <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> departed for the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Ministerial Meeting in The Hague.<note n="3" xml:id="d35fn3">May
              10–14.</note> It concerned the German reunification proposal now before the
            Ambassadorial Group.</p>
                    <p>As a result of rumors to the effect that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
            proposal had not been well received by the other three and that they had suggested that
            the proposal be presented by the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> on its own, he had
            experienced increasing pressures from within his party which he found difficult to hold
            down. If there is no agreement on the basis of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
            proposal, or if it is not put forward jointly but the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> is forced to present it alone, it would appear to all that ground had
            been lost in the solution of the German question. This posed not only a general problem
            but an acute internal German political problem. If it should be suspected that it was
            the US which had blocked agreement on a proposal which France would have accepted, he
            would find it extremely difficult to control the pro-French group, which was small but
            very powerful.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor expressed his firm conviction that the presentation to the Soviets of a
            suitable agreed proposal by the three powers in conjunction with the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> would not bring about a deterioration of US or Western
            relations with the Soviets. He pointed out that the Russians continued to put forward
            their proposals on all German and Berlin matters and that there was no reason why the
            West should not do the same. He favored the policy of seeking limited understandings
            with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> as he and the President had agreed in
            Texas. Indeed, the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> had just made it possible for the
            Bolshoi Ballet to appear in the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and West Berlin and
            it would probably accept an exchange of West and East German newspapers. However, the
            German people would not understand it if efforts to seek agreement were limited to
            peripheral issues, since they would conclude that the reunification issue had been
            forgotten.</p>
                    <pb n="77" xml:id="pg_77" facs="0107"/>
                    <p>The Chancellor understood there was little likelihood that anything put forward at this
            time would be negotiable with the Soviets. It was necessary, however, from both a
            psychological and political point of view, to put forward something concrete. The
            Chancellor urged strongly that the President discuss this matter with the Secretary
            before the latter's departure for The Hague. He urged further that every effort be made
            to reach Quadripartite agreement on a proposal which could be presented to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> by the three powers in association with the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>I replied that at the last Ministerial Meeting we had readily agreed to consider an
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> proposal. Since that time the German draft had
            been discussed, and in some instances modified, in the Ambassadorial Group. Other
            differences in view were still under discussion. We understood the German preference for
            a plan which the three powers could sponsor in association with the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. The question of whether the three powers should make the
            proposal to the Soviets or whether the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> should put it
            forward alone depended principally on whether a quadripartitely agreed proposal could be
            achieved. It was not a question of whether we all support reunification. I recounted
            efforts to this end made by the <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName>
            administration shortly after it first came into office when a crisis arose over
            Berlin.</p>
                    <p>The main problem about the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> proposal as it now stood
            and as it might be modified, was not whether it was negotiable with the Soviets but
            whether it constituted a credible Western position. It would be counter-productive if a
            position were put forward which represented a retrogression from previous positions or
            was so patently unrealistic as to have the appearance of a purely propaganda exercise.
            We were earnestly seeking a reasonable proposal in the Ambassadorial Group. If such a
            proposal could be formulated, I was sure we would be willing to associate ourselves with
            it. I would, however, convey the Chancellor's concern to the President immediately so
            that it could be taken into account by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> in his discussions with FonMin Schroeder and his British and French
            colleagues in The Hague.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> The fact that the Chancellor has raised this question as
            a matter of urgency, with the suggestion that his comments be passed directly to the
            President, indicates the importance he attaches to it. He has apparently come under
            increasing pressure from the Adenauer-Krone-Strauss-Guttenberg group on this issue. It
            may well be that the French, who we understand are really more lukewarm on the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> proposal than we, are hinting to this group that it is
            the US which is blocking the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> plan. I am not sure
            that Erhard, or even Schroeder, fully appreciate the repercussions their proposal might
            have. They do, however, feel strongly that the present situation calls for some new
            Western initiative on reunification for which they would like, because of internal
            political considerations, to obtain credit. The Germans have clearly gained the <pb n="78" xml:id="pg_78" facs="0108"/>impression from the Ambassadorial meetings and from
            other information which has reached them that the Americans are not enthusiastic about a
            new initiative. They seem to feel that our approach is overly influenced by the possible
            effect which such an initiative might have on our relations with the Soviets, including
            our ability to negotiate additional bilateral agreements. The Chancellor emphasized
            twice that what he proposed would not, in his judgment, exacerbate our relations with
            Moscow.</p>
                    <p>This is not a critical issue from the standpoint of the Chancellor's overall position,
            which, following the Baden-Wuerttemberg election, is now stronger than ever. It could,
            however, determine whether Schroeder can in the future merely survive as Foreign
            Minister—and possibly only until the 1965 elections—or whether he can play an important
            role, commensurate with his ability, in the making of German foreign policy.</p>
                    <p>I recommend strongly that this matter be discussed by the Secretary and the President
            prior to the Secretary's departure and that insofar as possible we take a positive
            position in discussions on this question at The Hague. As the Dept is aware, the Embassy
            in Embtel 3953 submitted a suggestion for an alternative approach in the event agreement
            along the lines proposed by the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> is not feasible.
            This would have the effect of deflecting the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
            proposal into the creation of a four-power standing committee on the German problem. I
            am submitting by separate telegram a summary of views expressed recently by
            Kuhlmann-Stumm and Majonica, foreign policy leaders in the <gloss target="#t_FDP1">FDP</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> respectively, which would
            indicate the acceptability of such an approach in <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
            political circles (see Embtel 4099).</p>
                    <p>I believe there is a temporary malaise in our relationship with the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, some of the aspects of which are being dealt with in a
            subsequent telegram. While I do not believe this is serious, I feel it justifies a
            little greater effort now than we might otherwise make along the lines proposed by the
            Chancellor in order to provide convincing evidence that we have not lost sight of the
            German reunification objective in our efforts to achieve more limited agreements with
            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>

                    <p>My dear Mr. President:</p>
                    <p>I would like to thank you sincerely for your letter which Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> transmitted to me on the 6th of March.<note n="2" xml:id="d36fn2">
                            <ref target="#d15">Document 15</ref>.</note> Your thoughts have been very interesting
            to me and I would like to assure you that it is my sincere desire to remain in permanent
            close contact with you.</p>
                    <p>I noted with particular satisfaction the large extent to which our opinions coincide
            with regard to the relations between a united Europe and the United States of America.
            The points of view of the United States and the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>
            concerning some important aspects of the <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName>
            Round have already been harmonised. I am glad about that and believe that the
            difficulties still to be expected, particularly in the field of agriculture, can be
            overcome in the course of negotiations concerning specific proposals and objectives.</p>
                    <p>The solution of the Cyprus question appears to me to be extremely important for the
            unity of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. As the original peace plan could not be
            put into the effect we have contributed financially to the peace-keeping action of the
            United Nations. It appears also to me that the re-establishment of peace on the island
            is an essential precondition for a political solution which is to be prepared for the
            United Nations by the Finnish mediator. We are, however, aware of the difficult task of
            the mediator. My government follows with great concern in particular the efforts of the
            Soviet government to exploit the discord among our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
            Allies over the Cyprus question and to draw Cyprus into their sphere of influence. I
            think it is necessary to keep in mind this threatening aspect in any political
            settlement and to bring it to the attention of our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
            Allies directly concerned.</p>
                    <p>I fully share your view that in the present situation South Vietnam cannot be abandoned
            by the West. Neither do I see in a plan for neutralization an appropriate solution to
            the problem, for nobody can ignore the danger that such a neutralization could open the
            way towards a future seizure of power by the Communists. In that case Thailand and
            Malaysia would be threatened directly and thus forced to politically reorientate
            themselves. A severe undermining of the Western position in the whole of East Asia would
            result. Therefore, we shall support within our given possibilities the United States in
            their efforts to maintain South Vietnam <pb n="80" xml:id="pg_80" facs="0110"/>as a
            bulwark of the Free World in South East Asia. We shall continue our assistance for South
            Vietnam in the political, economic and cultural fields.</p>
                    <p>As you well know, the Federal Government is prepared to support strongly the efforts of
            the United States which aim at lessening the Cuban-Communist threat to Latin America.
            Neither among the Cuban population nor in the other parts of Latin America should under
            any circumstances as a result of action by the Western countries the impression be
            created that Castroism is profitable. Within the scope of our legal possibilities we
            shall continue therefore in our endeavors to keep trade with Cuba on the lowest level.
            In particular, we shall continue to refuse government guarantees for exports to
            Cuba.</p>
                    <p>The support of the developing countries is also in my view necessary for the creation
            of stable conditions in these countries; this is in the best interest of the Free World.
            The aid to developing countries will therefore be a very important task for a long time
            to come. Our future budget plans will significantly reflect our efforts in this field.
            Intensified efforts in the field of public relations endeavor with increasing success to
            win over the German people for this attitude. I am, however, certain that I can count on
            your understanding that our respective annual efforts will have to be in proportion to
            our economic growth and in particular to our other obligations as, for instance, our
            defense needs and our obligations in the field of social payments.</p>
                    <p>Equally I follow the disarmament conference in Geneva with interest and hope; I regret
            that, in spite of your constructive proposals<note n="3" xml:id="d36fn3">For text of the
              U.S. proposals of January 21 and February 13, see American Foreign Policy: Current
              Documents, 1964, pp. 1012–1028.</note> no substantial progress has been achieved since
            January. I am glad, however, that it was possible to find among the Allies a common
            basis with regard to the project of the ground observation posts, and thus to provide a
            constructive contribution to the Geneva talks. This was brought about thanks to the
            close consultations with our friends and their preparedness to examine and take into
            consideration our proposals and our concerns. Regarding the freezing of strategic
            nuclear carrier weapons—which for the time being is probably the most important and far
            reaching armaments control proposal—consultations are taking place at present, which in
            my view should be as extensive as possible to thoroughly explore all aspects of the
            problem, as e.g., the difficult question of inspection. I share your hope that a slowing
            down of the arms race rather than an escalating arms race will contribute towards
            overcoming the partition of the German people.</p>
                    <p>I have appreciated it very much that the American representatives in the Washington
            Ambassadorial Group endeavor to support and to <pb n="81" xml:id="pg_81" facs="0111"/>further quadripartite deliberations concerning a Western initiative for the
            reunification of Germany. I think that the preparation of such a document is
            particularly important since it is imperative that we are prepared at all times to take
            steps vis a vis the Soviet Union in the question of Germany. Such a policy is also of
            importance because it could counteract the still existing assumption of Moscow that on
            the Western side a generally passive basic trend prevails with regard to the German
            question. This false assessment could anew cause Soviet misinterpretations and it could
            again lead towards an aggressive policy of the Soviet bloc in the question of Germany
            and Berlin.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, it should not be overlooked that the German public expects the West to
            take steps in the question of Germany. This the more so as almost five years have gone
            by since the West has last undertaken an initiative namely with the last Western peace
            plan of 1959.</p>
                    <p>I am in agreement with you that the stationing of American Armed Forces in Germany in
            unreduced strength continues to be imperative for the common defense of the alliance.
            The question of the balance of payments, resulting from the military expenditures of
            your country in the Federal Republic of Germany is also of greatest importance for my
            government. The agreements concerning the years 1961 and 1962 having been fulfilled to
            their full extent I have no doubt that satisfying arrangements can be reached in the
            discussion between Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and Herrn von
            Hassel. You may be assured, Mr. President, that I shall support all endeavors to achieve
            constructive results.</p>
                    <p>A few days ago Mr. Shriver called on me and gave me your kind letter of the 22nd of
              April.<note n="4" xml:id="d36fn4">A copy of the President's message suggesting

                    <p>Following the dinner, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName> said that he
            considered this meeting a follow-up to the one held in Paris last December<note n="2" xml:id="d37fn2">See <ref target="frus1961-63v15#d245">
                                <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1961–1963, vol. XV, Document
              245</ref>.</note> and the work done by the Ambassadorial Group in Washington. He said
            he would like to hear first from Schroeder, particularly whether Schroeder thought the
            initiative should be a declaration or designed to bring about negotiations.</p>
                    <p>After expressing gratitude for the work of the Ambassadorial Group, Schroeder said he
            would like to see the three Western powers take a step vis-à-vis the Soviet Union. This
            should contain the basis for negotiations. For the Federal Republic to take a step at
            this time would be too theoretical. Schroeder emphasized that he did not have in mind
            propaganda or merely quieting certain quarters back home. The Germans felt that the
            struggle with the Soviet Union would continue and that ground would be lost if the
            position on Germany were not made clear. He did not agree with those who said that a
            step at this time would <pb n="83" xml:id="pg_83" facs="0113"/>lead to deterioration in
            relations with the Soviets. Although he was not optimistic about a positive Soviet
            response, he thought that the idea of a Four Power group might interest the Soviets. In
            any event, the step would not cause a negative Soviet reaction. He proposed, therefore,
            that the work of the Ambassadorial Group be condensed in form and content and presented
            to the Soviets by the three Western powers either jointly or in a parallel manner.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName> asked Schroeder if when he spoke of the
            Four Power council he thought that it would take up the question of German unification
            at the outset. Schroeder noted that the German paper was rather comprehensive regarding
            the tasks assigned to the council. The Secretary remarked that the Four Power council
            would only meet if the Soviets accepted the over-all proposal.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName> asked Schroeder what he thought were the
            chances for negotiations on the basis of the German plan. Schroeder replied that he
            thought there probably would be no full acceptance, but at least the unity of the West
            would have been demonstrated.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName> asked Schroeder if he thought a
            tripartite initiative would have any effect on the effort of the Federal Republic to
            improve its relations with the satellites. Schroeder replied that he thought the two
            policies were quite compatible.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName> then raised the question of European
            security. Schroeder emphasized that it would be a mistake to make any concessions now in
            view of the uncertainty regarding whether the Soviets would engage in negotiations.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve de Murville</persName> remarked that he understood
            that Schroeder wanted to keep the reunification question alive. He noted that the German
            proposal had been discussed in Washington at length. General agreement had been reached
            on the German paper. The question of how the German paper would be endorsed, however,
            was not really discussed. Now Mr. Schroeder had new thoughts. He wanted the three powers
            to take an initiative. He asked Mr. Schroeder to give his thoughts on this change in
            procedure.</p>
                    <p>Schroeder replied that Couve's statement proceeded from a wrong assumption. There had
            not been a change in the German views. The German Government had always been flexible on
            procedure. What it mainly wanted was an agreement on ideas. Finally, after considering
            the various alternatives, the German Government had decided on a tripartite initiative.
            He did not preclude some changes in the German paper, provided they did not touch the
            substance. Couve remarked that Schroeder then wanted the Three to propose negotiations
            on Germany.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary then asked Schroeder why the Germans felt that unification had moved into
            the background. Schroeder replied that there is a feeling in Germany that as the West
            reaches agreements with the Soviets it <pb n="84" xml:id="pg_84" facs="0114"/>may come
            to the conclusion that only the Germans block further agreement. This was the line taken
            by <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> last year in New York. The West,
            therefore, should put its position on Germany forward. He felt that if it didn't, there
            would be serious consequences.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that we would like to meet the German needs. He felt there was no
            problem on substance. He noted, however, that there was no common basis at present for
            negotiations with the Soviets. The Secretary reminded the others that he had spent a
            great deal of time in the past few years trying to find a basis for negotiations with
            the Soviets on Berlin and Germany, but without success. Now he thought the Soviet
            position may have worsened, partly because of the Federal Republic's policy toward
            Eastern Europe and its success in isolating East Germany. He noted that Ulbricht was
            complaining about liberalization in Prague and the trade treaty between the Federal
            Republic and the Eastern European countries. The Secretary added that he understood that
            Malinovsky during his recent visit to East Germany, had told Ulbricht that he should
            forego for now a separate peace treaty. The Secretary said that he had no difficulty
            with the idea of a declaration which made the position clear on Germany. He noted that
            he and other American officials had regularly made the attitude of the U.S. on German
            unification clear in speeches. The Secretary emphasized that we are under no illusions
            about any so-called détente with the Soviet Union. He asked Schroeder if the Germans
            felt that we should not talk on any subject with the Soviets unless it were linked to
            German unification. The Secretary also noted that if we made a proposal for negotiations
            or a lengthy declaration we will be asked questions about security and such problems as
            territorial boundaries on which at present we do not have agreed answers. He concluded
            by saying that he thought the present German paper contained too much to be a
            declaration and too little to be a basis for negotiations.</p>
                    <p>Schroeder noted that many formal offers have been made to the Soviet Union on Germany,
            beginning in 1954.<note n="3" xml:id="d37fn3">For texts of Soviet proposals for a German
              peace treaty, February 1, 1954, for the neutralization of Germany and for a treaty of

              1944–1985, pp. 411–416.</note> He did not think that the Germans wanted to link all
            problems to unification. The Germans had not objected to American wheat sales to the
            Soviet Union<note n="4" xml:id="d37fn4">For text of the announcement of the U.S.-Soviet
              agreement, October 9, 1963, see American Foreign Policy: Current Documents, 1963, pp.

            (The Secretary remarked that Europe had traded ten times as much as the United States
            with the Soviet Union without asking any concessions.) Schroeder added that the trade
            agreements with Eastern European countries were not linked with unification because this
            must come from the Soviets. Schroe-der <pb n="85" xml:id="pg_85" facs="0115"/>emphasized
            that there should be no concrete proposals on security before negotiations took place.
            The question of territories, on the other hand, could be discussed in the Four Power
            council. We should make it clear, however, that these discussions should be based on the
            right of self-determination. Schroeder concluded by asking: if the others were prepared
            to accept the German paper as a basis for a declaration why were they not prepared to
            submit it to the Soviets as a basis for negotiations?</p>
                    <p>The Secretary remarked that if we join in a proposal and get a “no,” he thought the
            American people would look upon this as a defeat at the hands of the Soviets. Schroeder
            said he didn't want to question the Secretary's estimate of the American reaction, but
            that he doubted that many Americans would consider a “no” a defeat, in view of the large
            number of “no's” the Soviet Union had already given the United States.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName> said that the British Government liked the
            idea of a Four Power council. He would like to see consideration given to making a
            proposal for a Four Power council privately to the Soviets. He would also like to have
            separate study given at the same time to a briefer declaration.</p>
                    <p>Couve said that his only worry regarding the German paper concerned security, on which
            the German paper is vague. He thought this should be discussed a little further. He said
            that he would make no secret of the French attitude on this question. If Germany were
            reunified, something would be needed regarding European security, and this should not be
            linked to the neutralization of Germany. Couve said he understood Schroeder's situation.
            Couve emphasized that he wanted by all means to avoid any impression that there was
            disagreement following this meeting.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary then proposed that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName>, Lord Hood, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName>
            and M. <persName corresp="#p_LCE1">Lucet</persName> meet the following day and continue
            the discussion. Schroeder said he thought this was a good idea and perhaps these four
            could submit some proposals to the Foreign Ministers.</p>
                    <p>Schroeder said he would also like to say something tonight as well as something in the
              <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> communiqué.<note n="5" xml:id="d37fn5">For text
              of the communiqué, released on May 15, see Department of Stare Bulletin, June 1, 1964,

            regarding the meeting for press officers:</p>

            peaceful solution to the problem of Germany will have to be found on the basis of the
            right of self-determination.</p>
                    <p>“They agreed that each opportunity should be seized to bring the German people's wish

                    <p>“The Ministers wish to give further thought to the different possibilities and to

                    <p>4223. I do not wish to raise any question with respect to the wisdom of the Dept's
            policy, up to this point, of not supporting the German reunification proposals made to
            the Ambassadorial Group. I fully understand that broader considerations are involved
            including our current relations with the Soviets. The fact is, however, that before the
            recent <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Ministerial Meeting at The Hague ForMin
            Schroeder made a strong appeal to us (Embtel 3824)<note n="2" xml:id="d38fn2">Telegram
              3824 from Bonn, April 22, reported Schroeder's comments on German reunification

            appeal to the President (Embtel 4100).<note n="3" xml:id="d38fn3">

                    </p>
                    <p>I will see the Chancellor on May 22 to convey to him orally the message accompanying
            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName>'s letter to me of May 4,<note n="4" xml:id="d38fn4">Not found.</note> just received yesterday. It would be very
            helpful if I could present to him at that time, also orally, a message from the
            President giving the rationale behind our negative reaction to the German proposals,
            and, if possible, advising what our attitude will be during the reconsideration of these
            proposals in the Ambassadorial Group, as agreed upon by the four Foreign Ministers at
            The Hague.</p>
                    <pb n="87" xml:id="pg_87" facs="0117"/>
                    <p>I believe that we must keep in mind that we have hit the Germans very hard in recent
            weeks, at the highest levels, for a number of relatively important things we want them
            to do, i.e. the offset implementing agreement, and assistance to South Vietnam, to which
            they responded favorably, as well as the subject raised here May 6 by Komer and
              Sloan,<note n="5" xml:id="d38fn5">No documentation on this meeting was found.</note>
            to which they may not. There has, as a result, been a perceptible reaction here in the
            last few days, both on the part of officials and the press, to our recent requests. I
            would hope, therefore, that the Presidential message would, in addition, express
            appreciation for the offset agreement and the strong German support to our policy in
            South Vietnam contained in the <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>-von

            efforts to respond to <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s request for a
            medical unit.</p>
                    <p>I believe we should, moreover, delay for the time being any further new requests of the
            Germans involving any substantial contributions or sacrifices on their part. It is for
            this reason that I do not believe a visit by <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>
            Director Bell to press for additional development aid, although normally quite a
            desirable thing, would be so at this time. This is particularly true in view of the fact
            that next year's budget is now so frozen that we could not realistically expect it to be
            changed.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>The German election campaign for 1965 is already under way and Mayor Brandt's visit
            here on Monday, just as <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s in June, is an
            important element in that campaign.</p>
                    <p>
                        <pb n="88" xml:id="pg_88" facs="0118"/>Brandt is bright, easy, and affable, but is very
            leaky. You can count on the substance of your private conversations with him reaching
            the German press in relatively short order. And since he is running hard against
              <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> for the Chancellorship, he is not
            above using the substance of his talks with you for firing broadsides against Erhard.
            Therefore what we say to him must be the things that will not bounce back on us while he
            leaks them.</p>
                    <p>The two principal controversial issues between Brandt and <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> now are (1) the question of passes which would permit West
            Berliners to visit East Berlin (at the present time, West Germans can visit East Germany
            but West Berliners cannot enter East Berlin), and (2) tactics in the German struggle for
            reunification.</p>
                    <p>In connection with the passes, <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> has
            admitted frankly he is bothered by Brandt's exploitation of the issue and has made it
            clear he will not permit the Mayor to continue to exploit it for the benefit of the
            Socialists. In dealing with this problem you might remind the Mayor of your statement on
            the 15th anniversary of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> in which you said, “We did
            not make the Iron Curtain. We did not build the Wall. Gaps in the Curtain are welcome,
            and so are holes in the Wall, whenever they are not hedged by traps.”<note n="3" xml:id="d39fn3">For text of the April 3 speech, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of
              the United States: Lyndon B. Johnson, 1964</hi>, Book I, pp. 433–436.</note> The point that
            Brandt should take away with him is that although we feel every effort should be made to
            “humanize” the Wall, the means for accomplishing this should be worked out jointly by
            Bonn and Berlin, in consultation with the Western Allies, who continue to bear
            responsibility for the security of Berlin.</p>
                    <p>There is essentially the same kind of problem in dealing with reunification. The
              <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> government is now wrestling with an
            unsatisfactory plan for which allied endorsement is being sought, while the Socialists
            are looking on in amused silence. Your own position on reunification was made quite
            clear both during your meetings with <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> at
            the Ranch and in your <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> anniversary speech in which
            you said, “We continue to believe that the peace of all Europe requires the
            reunification of the German people in freedom.” The point that should be made with
            Brandt here is that the United States is prepared to support any sensible proposal which
            truly advances and does not undermine the cause of reunification, and will work closely
            with its British, French and German allies to this end. This will probably be used by
            Brandt to show that we are for realism on these matters—but so we are, and it doesn't
            hurt to have it known.</p>
                    <p>Brandt's advance agent, his press secretary <persName corresp="#p_BE5">Egon
              Bahr</persName>, has indicated that the Mayor also intends to ask you specifically
            what the Germans should do to meet the Soviets part way to allay legitimate concerns
            about <pb n="89" xml:id="pg_89" facs="0119"/>Germany and facilitate the achievement of a
            détente. To encourage him without giving him, too, ammunition with which to bludgeon the
            Bonn Government, you might cite as an example of what the U.S. Government has in mind
            the recent German effort to establish useful and constructive working relationships with
            Eastern Europe (trade missions in Poland, Hungary, Rumania and Czechoslovakia). This is
            a helpful move in the right direction. It is our hope that the Germans will continue to
            take every reasonable step to reassure the Eastern Europeans of Germany's peaceful
            intentions and carefully consider all reasonable proposals to this end which do not
            threaten the freedom and security of West Germany and West Berlin.</p>

                    <p>The Secretary opened the discussion by noting that it was important, as we deal with
            Berlin and German questions in the next few years, <pb n="90" xml:id="pg_90" facs="0120"/>not to allow them to become a partisan issue either in the U.S. or in Germany. If they
            become partisan issues in Germany there will be an attempt to draw the U.S. in. The
            result would only help the Soviets. The Secretary asked Mayor Brandt what the prospects
            on this were in Germany. Mayor Brandt replied that he was not sure how the situation
            would develop. At present the coalition in Bonn on foreign policy is different than that
            on domestic questions. He pointed out that he had no influence on developments within
            the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> or the <gloss target="#t_CSU1">CSU</gloss>.
            There were some difficulties there, but he didn't know how far they would go. The
            Secretary recalled that at a dinner several years ago in Bonn he had referred to
            bipartisanship. This had produced amused reactions on the part of some of the Germans
            present and he was not quite sure what this meant. Mayor Brandt said he thought it was
            important to link the question of German unification to decisions on other long-run
            problems. It would be undesirable if the impression were created that they were not
            linked. He noted that the Test Ban Treaty had not yet been approved by the Bundestag.
            Mayor Brandt added that he had spoken to Schroeder just before he went to The Hague. He
            thought they had an understanding that there must be a common front.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he was very interested in the change taking place in relations
            between the Federal Republic and Eastern Europe. The effect was to isolate <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>. He heard from time to time talk from Germany
            that any move toward a détente would be bad unless it were linked with the German
            problem. He wondered if there were an effort to apply a double standard. For example,
            some Germans had objected to the U.S. selling wheat to the Soviet Union when the U.S.
            trade with the Soviets is only a fraction of European trade. Mayor Brandt said he
            thought those who follow such things closely understand that the German question cannot
            be inserted at every point. In his travels around Germany he had found considerable
            support, particularly among young people, for Atlantic unity, peace between Germany and
            its neighbors to the East, and partial solutions along the lines of the Christmas pass
            agreement.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he would like to say directly to Mayor Brandt that the U.S. is not
            negotiating with the Soviets on European problems behind the back of the Germans. His
            last talk with the Soviets on Germany had been in Moscow at the time of the signature of
            the Test Ban Agreement.<note n="2" xml:id="d40fn2">See <ref target="frus1961-63v15#d204">
                                <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1961–1963, vol. XV, Document
              204</ref>.</note> He had emphasized the importance of allowing the Germans the right
            of self-determination. However, he got nowhere. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> seemed preoccupied with other problems and maintained that no
            one in the West was really interested in German reunification. Mayor Brandt commented
            that if we should move from peripheral questions we should consult the German
            Government.</p>
                    <pb n="91" xml:id="pg_91" facs="0121"/>
                    <p>The Secretary said he got the impression that the Soviets were preoccupied with the
            Chinese and internal problems and were not interested at the present time in serious
            discussions with the West. This does not mean we may not want to take some initiative
            because we can never tell when this might be desirable. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> was blaming the British and American elections for our
            inability to get ahead but this may be an excuse.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName> said he would like to
            comment on the question of linkage between unification and relaxation of tensions. The
            Federal Republic was not opposed to measures which were world-wide in nature, such as
            the Test Ban Agreement, or bilateral agreements between the U.S. and the Soviet Union.
            It did, however, feel that it had a direct interest in such measures as the <persName corresp="#p_RA4">Rapacki</persName> and Gomulka plans.<note n="3" xml:id="d40fn3">For
              the portions of <persName corresp="#p_RA4">Rapacki</persName>'s October 2, 1957,
              address calling for creating a denuclearized zone in Central Europe, see <hi rend="italic">Documents on Germany, 1944–1985</hi>, pp. 512–513. For text of his
              March 28, 1962, proposals on a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe, see <hi rend="italic">Documents on Disarmament, 1962</hi>, vol. I, pp. 201–205. For text of

                Documents</hi>, 1964, pp. 1086–1087.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he was sure the Soviets would be happy if we pursued their idea of
            agreement by mutual example. For example, if we were to withdraw troops from Germany,
              <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> would probably follow suit. We can't
            do this, however, until the German problem is settled. The Secretary added that he
            didn't believe relaxation of tension harmed the prospects for unification. After all,
            tension had not moved us toward German unity. (At this point both Schutz and Bahr
            murmured agreement.) On the other hand, the Secretary added, we can't assume that
            relaxation will lead to German reunification.</p>
                    <p>Mayor Brandt said he thought it might be desirable to concentrate on steps within
            Germany. He referred in this regard to statements in the Adenauer policy statement of
              1963<note n="4" xml:id="d40fn4">Apparently a reference to <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>'s April 25, 1963, statement to the Bundestag. For text, see
                <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Bundestag
                Reden</hi> (Bonn, 1967), pp. 336–340.</note> and the Erhard policy statement
            regarding the desirability of improving the situation in East Germany.<note n="5" xml:id="d40fn5">June 11. For text, see Europa Archiv, 1964, vol. 2, pp.
              318–323.</note> The Secretary commented that this was an interesting line of thought.
              <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> had mentioned to him the desirability
            of the situation in the Soviet Zone being improved. The Secretary said he thought it
            would be desirable to do things which remind the Germans that they belong together. The
            Federal Republic should also assure the Eastern European countries that they have
            nothing to fear from Germany.</p>
                    <p>Mayor Brandt then turned to the problem of the border with Poland. He noted that the
            Poles were in the incongruous situation of wanting to recognize two German states, but
            asking the one with which they did not have a common border to guarantee the border with
            the other state. It <pb n="92" xml:id="pg_92" facs="0122"/>might, however, be desirable
            to think in terms of some kind of qualified nonaggression arrangement which gave the
            Poles some assurance that the Federal Republic was not thinking in terms of a violent
            solution. The Secretary commented that this was an interesting idea. He was not sure of
            the Soviet reaction, since it presumes a common frontier between the Federal Republic
            and Poland. He then asked Mayor Brandt what he thought would happen after <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> disappeared from the scene. Mayor Brandt replied
            that he didn't know. There were more differences within the leading group in the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> than there were a year ago.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary commented that <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> has
            serious problems. He was not sympathizing with <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>'s problems but merely noting them. From the Communist point of
            view Peking was probably right in saying militancy is necessary to maintain Communism.
            The East Germans may appear to the Soviets like the boy with his hand in the Dutch dike.
            If the Soviets pull their divisions out of East Germany they may lose all of Eastern
            Europe. The Secretary added that he thought, however, that the more isolated <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> is, the better. Mayor Brandt agreed.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked if Mayor Brandt had any idea why the East Europeans are not jamming
            our radio as much. Brandt replied he thought this was because they needed the equipment
            to use against the Chinese. The Secretary expressed surprise at this and asked Mr.
              <persName corresp="#p_CRC1">Creel</persName> to get him a report on this.<note n="6" xml:id="d40fn6">No report was found.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName> said he thought it would be
            good if we could convince <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> that the
            disappearance of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> would not destroy their
            position in Eastern Europe. The Secretary asked if the Ambassador could say this with
            conviction. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName> said he thought
            there was a difference since the other Eastern European countries were national states,
            whereas the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> was not.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that in view of <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>'s
            remark to the Danish Prime Minister about responding to an American move against Cuba in
            Berlin, he thought he should say frankly to Mayor Brandt that the situation in Cuba was
            very explosive at present. We are continuing our overflights. The Soviets are training
            the Cubans to handle surface-to-air missiles and turning them over to the Cubans. The
            Cubans may be more nervous than the Soviets. This could lead to an explosive situation.
            He did not think it was an immediate matter but it could take a turn for the worse
            sometime in the future. We may be able to replace our overflights with other methods in
            time, but for now we must be sure there are no missiles in Cuba. The Secretary added
            that the situation in South Viet Nam is also very dangerous.</p>
                    <pb n="93" xml:id="pg_93" facs="0123"/>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName> asked if it would be
            possible to replace U–2s with satellites. The Secretary replied, not for several months.
            There was the problem of orbiting and satellites were much more expensive than <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>-2s. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName> asked if it were possible for <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>-2s to fly off the mainland. The Secretary replied that in this case they
            could only make adequate photographs 5–6 miles inland. There may be alternative means
            available some months ahead.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary noted that Mayor Brandt in his speech to the Foreign Policy
                            Association<note n="7" xml:id="d40fn7">For a summary, see <hi rend="italic">The New York Times</hi>, May 14,
              1964.</note> spoke of joint projects with the East. Mayor Brandt said that he did
            think it would be useful for us to make proposals to the East, such as to build highways
            across Europe. The Secretary said he was interested in this because we have discussed
            within the U.S. Government the possibility of technical cooperation with the Soviets. We
            might locate, for example, some technical institute on the autobahn. He added that
            moving the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to Berlin would be difficult, but that the
            location of some UN agency there would be acceptable to us.</p>

                    <p>3283. Washington visit of Mayor Brandt May 18–19 went off smoothly and effectively in
            cordial atmosphere throughout, and on departure yesterday evening Brandt expressed
            himself as extremely well satisfied with visit. High point was 45-minute private talk
            May 18 with President, followed by luncheon for 50 guests (including Secretaries
              <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, Generals Taylor and Clay, Dean Acheson and <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">John McCloy</persName>) hosted by President. Following schedule
            which left him virtually no free time, Brandt had separate talks with Secretaries
              <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, Mrs. John Kennedy, Attorney General, Senator <persName corresp="#p_FJW2">Fulbright</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">McGeorge

            Writers Club, two receptions and various background briefings for correspondents.
            Senator Schuetz and Bahr accompanied Brandt to most appointments.</p>
                    <p>Substantive discussions covered wide range of subjects. Among highlights were
            following:</p>
                    <p>1. Emphasis placed by Brandt at every opportunity, as expected, on his advocacy of
            step-by-step approach to alleviate division of Berlin and Germany and introduce some new
            movement into German situation. He said he supported FonMin Schroeder's policy of
            “knocking at the kitchen window” (i.e., at <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>'s flanks and rear in Eastern Europe) but felt that at same time
            efforts should be made to “knock at the front door” (i.e., in Berlin). While expressing
            hope in rather wistful way that Allies could be “somewhat less neutral” on complex of
            problems centering around Passierschein issue, he expressed confidence Germans in Berlin
            and Bonn could work out common position for new pass arrangement, to which he hoped
            Allies would be able lend their full support. (See septel)<note n="2" xml:id="d41fn2">Not found.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>2. Brandt's indication to Rostow that he was now prepared give his full support to
              <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>3. Brandt's low-key suggestion to Secretary of possibility some sort of non-aggression
            agreement between <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> and Poland.</p>
                    <p>4. Strong plea by Brandt that <gloss target="#t_RIAS1">RIAS</gloss> be left untouched
            in event any curtailment <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> operations in Europe
            owing budgetary stringencies.</p>
                    <p>5. Repeated mention by Brandt and Schuetz of political need for further strengthening
            of ties between <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> and West Berlin, with
            particular reference to Globelgesetz.</p>
                    <p>6. President's luncheon toast<note n="3" xml:id="d41fn3">For text, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States: <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName>, 1964</hi>, Book I, pp.
              694–695.</note> stressing constancy of US purpose to bring about a united Berlin
            within a united Germany on basis self-determination and in peace and freedom, and fact

            convey orally following message from President:</p>
                    <p>1. Express to Chancellor President's appreciation for Chancellor's letter of May 8<note n="3" xml:id="d42fn3">
                            <ref target="#d36">Document 36</ref>.</note> and President's pleasure that he and
            Chancellor are in close agreement on important problems discussed in their exchange of
            correspondence.</p>
                    <p>2. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. Agree it would be desirable to convey to
            Chancellor message from President regarding reunification. With respect to your
            suggestion, however, that we advise Chancellor of what our attitude will be in
            Ambassadorial Group, we shall need to know more what British, and Germans as well, have
            in mind regarding a possible Four Power Council and what its relation to German paper
            might be before we decide what position we will take. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.</p>
                    <pb n="96" xml:id="pg_96" facs="0126"/>
                    <p>You should tell Chancellor President has followed personally discussions of German
            initiative on reunification particularly those which have taken place most recently at
            The Hague.<note n="4" xml:id="d42fn4">See <ref target="#d37">Document 37</ref>.</note>
            He feels that frank discussions which our representatives have had have helped us to
            understand more fully each other's point of view and preoccupations at present time.
            These discussions have made clear complexities of any initiative and importance for us
            to have most careful consideration and groundwork laid. President wants to assure
            Chancellor of his personal interest in goal of reunification through self-determination
            and his view that we should continue to consider jointly with our Allies what we may
            realistically do to make progress in this area.</p>
                    <p>3. Tell Chancellor we most appreciative of his cooperative attitude during Secretary
              <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s visit<note n="5" xml:id="d42fn5">See <ref target="#d38fn6">footnote 6, Document 38</ref>.</note> regarding both
            continuation of military offset and expression of <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
            support for our policy in South Viet Nam. We believe these are matters of great
            importance to both of us. We hope that <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> will be able
            take early action to provide medical unit or other concrete demonstration of support for
            Viet Nam.</p>
                    <p>4. Chancellor's letter of May 8 demonstrates how close is our common view of importance
            of aid to developing countries. Germany and US are donors of aid in more countries than
            any other contributor. Special reasons exist, therefore, for our governments to work
            closely together on development assistance. Accordingly, President will wish to discuss
            problems and prospects of our respective aid programs during Chancellor's forthcoming
            visit to Washington. In meantime consortia on India, Pakistan and Turkey will be meeting
            and it is our hope that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> will do its best to
            improve amounts and terms of its pledges to these three countries which are showing way
            in mounting major self-help efforts.</p>

                    <p>4318. In my meeting with Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>
            today, at which other subjects were discussed which are being reported separately,<note n="2" xml:id="d43fn2">Telegram 4310 from Bonn, May 10, reported the Chancellor's views
              regarding German foreign aid levels. (Ibid., Central Files, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_GER1">GER</gloss> W–US)</note> I gave him orally the message from
            the President concerning his exchanges with Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>,<note n="3" xml:id="d43fn3">
                            <ref target="#d34">Document 34</ref>.</note> which was contained in Ambassador
              <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName>'s letter of May 4, received May
              15.<note n="4" xml:id="d43fn4">Not found.</note> I had discussed the delivery date
            with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> who agreed that it was
            best to wait until the Chancellor's return from his Tegernsee vacation.</p>
                    <p>After the Chancellor had heard the message, he said that he welcomed the fact that the
            President had such a clear attitude toward the security of the German people. It was,
            moreover, not just a question of Germany. There was also involved the security of all
            the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries, as well as the countries of Central
            Europe. It was easy to recognize what was behind the Soviet proposition. Any withdrawal
            of their forces would be only for a short distance, say two hundred kilometers, and
            would have no effect on the military balance. A withdrawal of US forces would be for a
            distance of 6000 kilometers. Under such circumstances, it would be a delusion to believe
            this would not upset the military balance.</p>
                    <p>Reduction of forces in Central Europe would be possible only in connection with general
            disarmament measures resulting, under controlled conditions, in a decrease in the
            military forces of all countries, not just those of the two great powers. He would
            welcome further discussion of this subject when he meets the President in Washington on
            June 12.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Comments: The Chancellor was obviously pleased to be taken into the
              President's confidence in such an important matter. Although he disclaimed any doubts

                        <item>German Unity Proposal</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>1. We face an eventual need to put forward a proposal regarding German unity which will
            meet three tests:</p>
                    <p>(a) It will not be wholly implausible in terms of negotiability with the Soviets and
            will not damage East-West relations.</p>
                    <p>(b) It will meet German domestic political needs, so as to strengthen moderate German
            leadership against Strauss et al.</p>
                    <p>(c) It will be a proposal that we could live with, if the Soviets accepted it.</p>
                    <p>2. I doubt we can, until after the German 1965 elections, get German agreement to a
            substantive proposal on unity which meets the first test, i.e., which is at least as
            good as the revised Western Peace Plan.<note n="2" xml:id="d44fn2">For text of the
              Western Peace Plan, see Documents on Germany, 1944–1985, pp. 624–629.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>3. Nor is a proposal for convening a Four Power Conference on Germany likely to get us
            very far. The Conference would almost certainly fail, as the Geneva 1959 Conference
            failed; this would not be helpful in terms of either East-West relations or of German
            domestic needs.</p>
                    <p>4. I suggest we propose, instead, creation of a standing Commission on Germany and
            Central Europe, which would serve as a form for discussion of these issues, year in and
            year out, until they were ripe for settlement. The analogy of the Austrian State Treaty
            discussions may be relevant.</p>
                    <p>The Commission might be opened, like the Geneva Disarmament Conference, with Foreign
            Ministers (or Deputy Foreign Ministers) in attendance for the first week or two. Then it
            would descend, as the Disarmament Conference did, to the Ambassadorial level.</p>
                    <p>Vienna might be the site. It is more a symbol of successful negotiation (Austrian State
            Treaty and <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>) than Geneva, which has become a symbol
            of deadlock. Vienna might be attractive to the Soviets, and it would symbolize the
            Central European focus of the group's work.</p>
                    <p>The US, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, France, and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would be members of the Commission. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would probably want East (and West) Germany represented <pb n="99" xml:id="pg_99" facs="0129"/>on the same terms as at Geneva in 1959. Perhaps this could
            be somewhat blunted by including Germany's four neighbors—Poland, Belgium,
            Czechoslovakia, and Holland—in the same “observer” status.</p>
                    <p>The terms of reference of the Commission should be broad enough and vague enough to
            satisfy the Germans that it was going to talk about German unity, without forcing the
              <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to acknowledge the four occupying powers'
            responsibility for unification.</p>
                    <p>5. What would the Commission actually discuss? I suppose at first the West would run
            through the virtues of the Western Peace Plan, and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would say that German unity was for East and West Germany to decide.</p>
                    <p>But perhaps the Four Powers could then agree to talk about the security provisions that
            would be appropriate to a peace treaty with a united Germany—leaving aside the question
            of how unity came about. Through such discussions we could try gradually to get the
            Soviets to see that German unification could be hedged about with sufficient safeguards
            to assume [<hi rend="italic">assure</hi>] their security. This might be helpful if and
            when the time came (e.g., against the background of a succession crisis) for the Soviets
            to consider seriously the possibility of German unification.</p>
                    <p>The Commission could also talk about Berlin; safeguards against war by accident and
            miscalculation in Central Europe; and other topics related to stabilizing this area.</p>
                    <p>6. But the proposal's merit is not tied to the view that any of the above would be on
            its agenda. It lies rather in the fact that:</p>
                    <p>(a) The Commission's existence would help to assure German opinion that the German
            question was still on the front burner.</p>
                    <p>(b) It would offer the Soviets a forum for talking out some of their concerns about
            security in Central Europe.</p>
                    <p>(c) Over time, its deliberations might be one more factor working for gradual
            constructive evolution in Soviet attitudes and East-West relations.</p>

                    <p>4418. Subject: Preparations for <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> visit;
              US–<gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> relations. On the general state of US–<gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> relations, I would not suggest that there is at present
            anything resembling a crisis in confidence. There is not. All essentials are in place.
            At the same time, a certain uneasiness has developed in recent weeks over the manner in
            which our alliance is operating. The Germans have gained the impression that they are
            becoming the object of mounting demands from us.</p>
                    <p>The following is by no means a complete list of the things we have officially asked the
            Germans to do in recent months which require effort or sacrifice on their part: increase
            their aid to underdeveloped countries; speed up formation of their peace corps; send
            troops to Cyprus; send aid and a medical unit to South Vietnam; give aid to Zanzibar;
            give aid to Turkey; extend the offset agreement; increase their military budget; make
            concessions to Yugoslavia; support our position on observation posts and other
            disarmament matters; liberalize their restitution program; give arms aid to Israel;
            increase American imports. Since many of these requests have been made on the occasion
            of visits by high American officials, their acceptance has often appeared to be the
            result of pressure.</p>
                    <p>This does not mean that these requests should not have been made, although with regard
            to timing and emphasis perhaps we should in the future pay a little closer attention to
            their cumulative effect. It is logical that Germany come under increasing pressure for
            requests of this type because: 1) increased prosperity in Germany makes it possible for
            her to do for the first time things she could not have done in the past, indeed creates
            an obligation on her part (as the second or third free world economic power) to do so;
            2) Germany's interests have been, up to this point, largely centered in Europe and she
            must be persuaded to play more of a world role; 3) despite the offset, we still pay
            budget-wise for the 7th Army here, which should provide us considerable leverage in
            asking favors of the Germans; 4) Germany has many problems, such as reunification, for
            which she needs assistance from us and other free world countries, hence she must be
            prepared to help us with our problems.</p>
                    <p>It is moreover to be expected that it is we, as the residuary legatee of the free
            world's problems, who, on most occasions, must ask the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> for help. The Germans, during this period, have asked for little that is
            new <pb n="101" xml:id="pg_101" facs="0131"/>(perhaps because we already do so much),
            but even in the few matters of minor importance which they have put up to us, e.g.,
            Bavarian coal, they have had little success. We have, of course, shown consideration in
            certain instances, such as delaying the withdrawal of Roundout and Long Thrust forces,
            and retaining the extra strength of an augmented battalion in Berlin. In the one matter
            of capital interest to them, however, for which they have sought our backing at the
            highest level, i.e., their initiative on reunification, we are still hesitant.</p>
                    <p>Sensitivity with regard to seeming pressure from the US is particu-larly great in the
              <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> because of the still recent experience of
            occupation. The reaction often takes the form of criticism of the Federal Government for
            a lack of backbone and an independent policy. This creates internal pressure on the
            government to demonstrate its independence which, in turn, could lead to serious
            problems for the government and possibly to actions that are contrary to our, or even to
            their, interests.</p>
                    <p>In addition, there is at present the special and important circumstance that Chancellor
              <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> and Foreign Minister Schroeder have
            embarked on the difficult task of pursuing a more “flexible” foreign policy toward the
            Soviet Union—which is entirely in accord with US policy and in opposition to strong
            forces within their own party. If they are to retain public support and ward off attacks
            from their opponents, they must not appear to be acting under US pressure. The
            attraction of Schroeder's efforts to achieve an improvement in the Federal Republic's
            position in Central and Eastern Europe through trade agreements and missions and
            cultural exchanges is that it is considered to be a German initiative. If it should come
            to seem only a reflection of US policy, it would become far more vulnerable to attack by
            the group around <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName>.</p>
                    <p>With this in the background, it seems to me important that we draw the following two
            conclusions from recent developments in our relations with the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>:</p>
                    <p>1. Whenever it does not run contrary to our vital interests, we should welcome, and,
            when possible actively encourage <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> foreign policy
            initiatives. In this way we can assist the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> to
            establish an independent identity for its policy and thereby (paradoxically) make it
            easier for the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> to follow our lead on matters where
            US vital interests are concerned. This is one reason why I have long hoped that we could
            support the FRG initiative on reunification. With success on this score, the FRG would
            be in a stronger position to cooperate with us elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>The current question of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>-ChiCom relations
            presents some of the same opportunities and hazards for us as the reunification
            initiative. Looking at the problem from Bonn, there could be advantages to an <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> trade agreement with the ChiComs if it includes a Berlin
            clause; it would, from current indications, not go much beyond the “private” trade
            agreement <pb n="102" xml:id="pg_102" facs="0132"/>of September 1957<note n="2" xml:id="d45fn2">Reference is to the agreement signed in Beijing, September 27, 1957,
              between the Eastern Trade Committee of the West German Federation of Industry and
              Commerce and Chinese for the Promotion of International Trade.</note> and would not
            involve a politically more significant exchange of trade missions; yet it could
            effectively serve to isolate the Pankow regime further and make <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>'s personal position more difficult. It would tend
            to improve the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> position in those non-aligned
            countries where ChiCom influence is considerable; it could cause further dissension
            between Moscow and Peiping; and it might give the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> an
            additional lever in future dealings with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.
            There are obvious disadvantages from the US point of view, possibly of such a compelling
            nature as to force us to continue to dissuade the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
            from such a step. However, we may at least wish to consider the desirability of the
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> having somewhat more latitude in their China
            policy.</p>
                    <p>2. We should avoid placing the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> in a position where
            it seems, publicly, to acting as a result of US pressure. I realize that in view of our
            position and responsibilities there are times when we must exert pressure. We should,
            however, do so sparingly and privately if possible, giving the FRG every opportunity to
            convey the impression of taking independent action and to receive whatever credit may be
            derived therefrom. We should avoid any appearance of “lecturing” to the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. The period when this could profitably be done has long
            since passed.</p>
                    <p>I would cite our recent approach on South Vietnam as a case in point. From what we have
            heard, our handling of the matter at Bonn and The Hague<note n="3" xml:id="d45fn3">Conversations in Bonn were reported in telegram 4246, May 19, telegram 4341, May 26,
              telegram 4393, May 29, all from Bonn. (Department of State, Central Files, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 27 VIET <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) No record of

            pushed too openly. This occasioned some resentment in government circles, and a cool,
            often critical, press reaction.</p>
                    <p>In view of the various items which we shall probably be pursuing with the Chancellor
            during his Washington visit, I would particularly urge that we avoid any appearance that
            new <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> concessions to US policy (such as grain price)
            result directly from the meetings. My suggestions for treating specific points which may
            arise during the conversations will follow in separate telegrams.</p>

                    <p>3547. Subject: <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> Visit. <gloss target="#t_CSU1">CSU</gloss> Chairman <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName>
            concluded five-day visit in Washington yesterday and departed for Chicago where he will
            receive honorary degree (De Paul University). <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> commented before departing that his Washington visit, which he
            said had been for “informational” purposes and not the main objective of his trip to US,
            had been most satisfactory. His Washington schedule included appointments with
            Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">McGeorge Bundy</persName>, Rostow,
              <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName>, Gerard Smith, <persName corresp="#p_SJR3">Schaetzel</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_CRC1">Creel</persName>
            and <gloss target="#t_GER1">GER</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_BTF1">BTF</gloss> officers. On
            Capitol Hill he met with Senators <persName corresp="#p_MCEJ1">McCarthy</persName> and
              <persName corresp="#p_FJW2">Fulbright</persName>, who escorted him to Senate floor
            during civil rights bill debate. Understand <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> also had conversations with Dean Acheson and <persName>Walter
              Lippmann</persName>.</p>
                    <p>In general <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName>' approach was one of friendly
            reasonableness. On several occasions he expressed himself in basic agreement with US
            policy on Germany and East-West relations as outlined to him. On another he commented
            that the last thing in the world he wanted was to be considered in any way as
            anti-American. Highlights of substantive discussions, during which he came down heavily
            and repeatedly on theme of no real détente without solution of German problem, included
            following:</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">“Détente”</hi>—We stressed that range of US-Soviet agreements thus
            far very small; all big questions, such as German problem, still remained unresolved. We
            were concerned that any feeling of détente might cause Europe to relax prematurely.
              <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> asserted that détente policy should be
            looked upon as political weapon, not as “chance to go to sleep.” Furthermore he would be
            strongly opposed to any détente based on nothing more than series of concessions to
            Soviets. He stressed that there was no way to solve German question short of general
            change in political structure in Eastern Europe; thus no isolated solution of German
            problem possible.</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Eastern Policy</hi>—<persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName>
            said he favors active eastern policy if undertaken in realization there has been no
            change in basic principles of Communism and that we make use of changes taking place to
            strengthen centrifugal forces in Eastern Europe. Strauss also said he favors trade
            relations and exchange of <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> trade missions with
            Eastern Europe but only provided they are used to strengthen nationalist tendencies in
            Eastern <pb n="104" xml:id="pg_104" facs="0134"/>Europe and to endeavor reconcile those
            countries to establishment of a united Germany.</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Reunification</hi>—We told Strauss that while we do not think it
            helpful deliberately to maintain tensions over issues which can be settled with Soviet
            Union, we are convinced that a permanently divided Germany cannot be reconciled with our
            basic security and national interests. No one in Washington believes it possible to
            shove German problem under rug, but on other hand there is no indication that Soviets
            are prepared to agree to reunification on terms compatible with Western security.
            Strauss replied he had no doubts or basic reservations about US policy on reunification
            as outlined to him.</p>
                    <p>4. <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>—<gloss target="#t_CSU1">CSU</gloss> will support
              <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> but may suggest two conditions: (1) <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> should not lead to nuclear disengagement from continental
            Europe; and (2) US should be prepared at some future point to turn <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> over to a European sovereignty if prerequisites therefore
            are met.</p>
                    <p>5. <hi rend="italic">European Integration</hi>—<persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> sees no chance of progress in framework of Six and suggested
            consideration of European confederation as halfway step to federation, with only three
            or four member countries if necessary.</p>
                    <p>6. Southeast Asia—We stressed to Strauss world-wide nature of Communist threat and
            potential threat to Europe (including Germany) posed by any deterioration our position
            in Viet Nam. Strauss took line that Germans were inhibited from accepting greater
            commitments in world at large by unhappy memories of their past history as a world
            power.</p>

            There was no doubt that <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> was under
            pressure from the other East European countries. There was growing anxiety in Moscow for

            Bloc countries although it had an unfavorable reaction in Moscow. Perhaps it would be
            possible to build in Eastern Europe an interest in a permanent German settlement, which
            was not necessarily in the interest of Moscow.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said that we had received an
            intelligence report to the effect that the Soviets might announce the withdrawal of
            15,000 men from somewhere in Eastern Europe. It was uncertain whether this might be from
            Hungary or Eastern Germany. It could well be that the Soviets would then say this is
            what we have done; let this be an example and do likewise. The US has said repeatedly,
            however, that this type of procedure is no basis for us to use.</p>
                    <pb n="106" xml:id="pg_106" facs="0136"/>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister said he felt that the possibility that the German trade
            commissions and their contacts in various Eastern European countries would lead to
            desirable political consequences was very remote and limited. In any event, developments
            would be slow and take a long time. The first persons sent to these countries by Germany
            were eating bitter rice. However, eventually something might come of it, and these trade
            contacts were useful. There was no objection on the part of Germany to the efforts of
            the United States in this direction. When the situation was right, the Germans would
            follow through. After all, the Minister said, that was the whole purpose of establishing
            trade relations. It was not Germany's primary objective to make the Eastern European
            countries happy economically.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary then suggested that talks with the small Eastern European countries be
            undertaken only after the possibility of talks with Russia had been made public. If
            talks with the other countries were undertaken without such preparatory moves, there
            might be a severe reaction in Moscow. But if such talks were preceded by a public
            announcement, as indicated above, pressure might well be applied on Moscow by the other
            countries.</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister Schroeder then reverted to a point previously discussed with the
            Secretary, concerning possibilities of action with reference to the question of German
            reunification. He briefly set forth four points: (1) A proposal might be made by
            Germany, which would then have the support of the three Western Powers. (2) A four-power
            commission could be established with a mandate; the exact nature of such a mandate to be
            the subject of discussions. (3) A plan might be submitted to Moscow by the three Western
            Powers. This, however, would be the most difficult line of action. (4) A point could be
            chosen at which the three Western Powers would reconfirm vis-à-vis Germany their
            intention and responsibility for the reunification of Germany. A very opportune occasion
            might perhaps be the signing of the pending Friendship Treaty. In any event,
            opportunities must constantly be sought for the three Western Powers to show their
            responsibility for reunification and to express their will to carry it out. This must be
            kept a live issue, and the Foreign Minister has urged Chancellor Erhard to discuss this
            with the President tomorrow.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister continued that it was perfectly clear that unless this was done
            the Germans would get the impression that the question of German reunification had been
            placed into a psychological icebox, and that those who carry on the discussions with the
            other side were no longer interested in this issue and might even fear to state their
            stand on the German problem vis-à-vis the Soviets. This impression had very undesirable
            implications among the German people.</p>
                    <pb n="107" xml:id="pg_107" facs="0137"/>
                    <p>The Secretary strongly emphasized that, while he was aware of this German reaction, he
            did not know how he could do more than he had actually been doing in this respect. It
            was a fact that in all his talks with the Soviets he had spent at least two-thirds of
            his time speaking about Germany and the German problem.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister quickly pointed out that he did not wish to be misunderstood and
            that what he had said should not be construed as a complaint. He felt, however, that
            everyone had to look ahead and had to gauge possible reactions to whatever would be
            undertaken, in order to avoid bad reactions both on the international and the national
            scene.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary then said he felt that it might be possible to put together several
            different things into one package; for instance, a declaration might be forthcoming from
            the Federal Republic of Germany, made publicly to all four powers. This might be
            followed by a thoughtfully prepared Three Power declaration in the nature of a Western
            response, aimed at the Soviet Union. All this should be done publicly. Then it would be
            up to the Soviets to pick this up and do something with it or not. That might be the
            occasion that might point toward the opening of discussions.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary stated that it was his impression that the Soviets do not speak about
            reunification in the sense in which we see it. They constantly come back to it as a
            problem to be settled by the two Germanies.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary raised the possibility of turning this to advantage, though he indicated
            he realized that <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> was not the man to try
            this on. Did the Foreign Minister think that the established trade contacts might
            possibly lead to some opportunities in this respect?</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister indicated that he viewed the political results of the trade
            relations in Eastern Europe skeptically. These countries of Eastern Europe were
            interested in improving their economies; they were not interested in the German
            question. They were interested in throwing off Soviet exploitation and in improving
            their economic ties with the West. The question of German unity did not enter into this,
            as far as they were concerned. They were interested solely in the economic aspects and
            it gave them a feeling of independence. The Foreign Minister felt, however, that they
            could not and would not be allowed to go very far in either respect. The Soviet Union
            was the controlling and dominating power, which would not permit any developments in the
            long run that were not in the Soviet interest. The small Eastern European countries were
            well aware of that.</p>

                    <p>The Secretary began by welcoming Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> to Washington and assuring him that the United States wants to do
            all it can to make his visit useful. Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> expressed his pleasure at being in Washington and said that these
            talks were taking place at an appropriate time, particularly in view of the treaty
            between the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the “<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.”<note n="2" xml:id="d48fn2">For text of the Soviet-East German treaty of
              friendship, mutual assistance, and cooperation, signed at Moscow on June 12, 1964, see
              Documents on Germany, 1944–1985, pp. 867–872.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> continued that although this treaty
            would give rise to a feeling of insecurity among some people, it would certainly not
            upset the West German government. US/<gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> relations are
            unshakeable and through a strong <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, peace and
            security will be guaranteed. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> then
            remarked that inevitably some people in Germany will ask whether the treaty is not the
            fruit of a policy of détente. As far as <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>
            is concerned, <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> is making a treaty with
            himself which may serve the <pb n="109" xml:id="pg_109" facs="0139"/>purpose of giving
            some compensation to <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>. Nevertheless even
            though no spectacular consequences can be anticipated from the treaty, the German
            Government must take into consideration that there will be a certain increase in
            uneasiness. Thus the Chancellor felt that his meetings in Washington were most
            opportune. He felt that the statement at The Hague on German reunification was a very
            good one, but still there will be questions raised in Germany asking when there will be
            action on the German problem. There will be questions as to why in an atmosphere of
            relaxation one cannot do something or take an initiative on the German problem.
            Chancellor Erhard said that he would be happy if these questions could be answered. He
            said that he had in mind a statement that could be issued today.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> replied that we do not regard this
            treaty as a helpful step and that it will undoubtedly raise anxieties within the West.
            He said our commitment on German reunification is clear. As far as a détente is
            concerned, we do not feel it has gone very far. We see two immediate dangers at this
            moment. One relates to Cuba where the Soviets are turning over to the Cubans
            surface-to-air missile sites. If the Cubans shoot down our overflights, we will have to
            shoot back hard. There is clearly a very explosive situation involved in having Cuban
            fingers on the missiles. The other explosive situation exists in Southeast Asia where
            there are gross violations of the 1954 and 1962 accords by Hanoi and Peiping. The United
            States is not going to get out of Southeast Asia. The situation there does not smell of
            détente but of great danger.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that we are interested in <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s impressions of important moves now going on which are affecting
            the status quo. How do they relate to the German question and what long-range trend can
            result from improved relations between the FRG and Eastern Europe? What is the
            significance of <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>'s nervousness stemming
            from his isolation in Eastern Europe? Concerning reunification, there is no problem for
            US policy in view of our commitment to the objective of self-determination for the
            German people. We are prepared to take a hard look at this matter to see what we can do
            to meet the Chancellor's needs. Our main concern is that whatever we do, we do together;
            that we not start something on which we are going to separate once we get started. We
            are prepared to work hard on German reunification.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor said he did not think that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>-“<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>” treaty will affect Berlin since
            that would contradict <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>'s policy of
            reducing tension. What has gone on so far is no real détente. Our policies must move
            toward the core of the problem. At the same time, the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> did not want to pursue a single-minded interest in the German problem to
            the exclusion of other critical problems in the world such as the Cuban situation. The
            Chancellor then said that the policy of neutralization in <pb n="110" xml:id="pg_110" facs="0140"/>Indo-China initiated by <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>
            was not possible.<note n="3" xml:id="d48fn3">Reference is to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>'s June 24 speech welcoming Prince Sihanouk of Cambodia to
              France. For text, see <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">Charles de Gaulle</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Discours et Messages</hi>, vol. 4, pp. 217–218.</note> He questioned
            whether the Chinese could be won over and whether they would be prepared to withdraw
            from Southeast Asia if they were admitted to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>With regard to Eastern Europe <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> said he
            was convinced that <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> was concerned about
            the movement toward greater independence by the Eastern European countries. He then
            referred to the Seebohm speech<note n="4" xml:id="d48fn4">Apparent reference to a May 13
              speech at Nuremburg in which the Minister of Transportation attacked Czechoslovakia
              over its treatment of Sudeten Germans and implied the validity of the 1938 Munich
              agreement.</note> as a “somewhat unpleasant episode.” He said he had done his best to
            make his government's position clear: Hitler had torn up the Munich Agreement and the
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> has no territorial claims against Czechoslovakia.
            Nevertheless the speech had been a “great blow” to the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> since it had raised new doubts in the Eastern European countries about
            the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. He asked for understanding for the German
            position on this matter.</p>
                    <p>On the German reunification initiative, the Chancellor said he would welcome it if the
            Ambassadorial Group could work out something which could be implemented at an
            appropriate time. He acknowledged that this effort must be coordinated and that each
            side had its own problems to consider. The important thing is to act together. He said
            it was regrettable that elections in both our countries would give rise to certain
            unfortunate statements. Nevertheless he felt there would be great continuity in both
            countries. He said he would be happy to see all the elections over. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> seems to have the impression that nothing can happen until our
            elections are over even though we have tried to make him understand that we are still in
            business.</p>

                        <item>Mrs. Lejins </item>
                    </list>
                    <p>After the President presented the Chancellor with a number of gifts, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> expressed his pleasure at being in the United
            States again. He said despite a few discordant notes heard from time to time
            German-American friendship was firm and lasting. He considered the cooperation of the
            United States and Germany in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> the guarantee for the
            maintenance of peace and freedom in the world. U.S.-German friendship went beyond
            bilateral considerations. It was a major element bringing North America and Europe
            together.</p>
                    <p>He expressed concern about the great inflationary trend presently at work which could
            break up Europe. But it was Germany's task—for political, economic and social reasons—to
            guarantee the stability of Europe. The Chancellor felt his trip was very timely.
            Although he did not want to sound dramatic about the latest arrangements between the
            Soviet Union and East Germany, this most recent development could cause considerable
            concern and unrest. Therefore, the present visit and discussions could do much to allay
            fears in Germany.</p>
                    <p>Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> was sure the President was
            aware that the German press (although this did not, of course, affect German official
            policy) was asking when, in all the efforts being made to achieve a détente, the time
            would come to deal with the most important question which lay at the heart of
            everything—the German problem. Such discussions in Germany and their effect should not
            be underrated. Nine months after the U.S. elections, Germany also would be facing
            elections. At that time, the Chancellor would have to answer some of these questions. He
            certainly would not want to be disloyal to himself or his friends. But he would have to
            discuss these matters. Therefore, it would be most advantageous if something could come
            out of the present talks which could put German fears at rest and suppress certain
            nationalistic voices making themselves heard. He added he could not hide the fact that
            Goldwater's statements had been a real shock to much of Europe and had awakened <pb n="112" xml:id="pg_112" facs="0142"/>voices which had to be muted. But he wanted to
            make it clear that it was not the aim of his visit to bring about or set off any
            specific set of actions. Germany had been satisfied with the results of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meetings at The Hague. All he wished at this time was
            that discussions continue so German concerns could be met.</p>
                    <p>There were other problems, too. Chief among these was the future course of certain
              <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> developments, and particularly the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. The German attitude on this had not changed. Germany
            considers the MLF desirable and necessary. Since taking office, the Chancellor had
            visited almost all the capitals of Western Europe and discussed the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. While he did not find widespread enthusiasm for the
              <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, all seemed to realize that in the final analysis
            it was necessary to accept the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> and to make whatever
            contributions were necessary. Unless this was done, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName> might try to use the force de frappe, not as a military weapon, but
            as a political instrument to pursue his own independent European policy.</p>
                    <p>Then there was, too, the question of Israel and the Arab world which the Chancellor
            described as “a very hot one.” This represented a very delicate problem for Germany.
            Germany had done very much for Israel. There were the reparations and military
            assistance. But by the same token, Germany had to proceed very carefully because of
            possible adverse Arab reaction. The coming conference of the non-aligned nations in
            Cairo could take a very strong negative position (possibly recognize East Germany) which
            in turn could complicate the prospects for a German solution. Germany's relations with
            the Arab world were very good. Germany was not burdened with a colonial past and there
            were no present disputes with the Arab states. Germany had a good name and great
            prestige in the Arab world. Consequently, Germany could not do too much too fast as far
            as aid for Israel was concerned. The Chancellor therefore felt that Germany had found a
            good way of solving the problem of supplying Israel with tanks. Germany was going to
            ship the tanks to Italy where they would remain for a while and be equipped with weapons
            and ammunition. Later, they would be sent on from Italy to Israel—the connection would
            not be immediately or readily visible, although the end result would be the same.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor wanted the President to understand that Germany was not only thinking of
            her own problems. Other nations had theirs, too, and Germany shared these problems and
            was interested in them. He understood two of the President's major problems—Cuba and
            South Vietnam. In the case of Cuba, Germany followed U.S. desires and broke off her
            trade with Cuba and would continue to do so. In South Vietnam, Germany stood ready to do
            all that could be done economically, politically and financially. Germany was also
            considering what humanitarian contribution it could make, such as perhaps sending a
            hospital ship to the <pb n="113" xml:id="pg_113" facs="0143"/>area. These were
            questions, however, that should be discussed at another level.</p>
                    <p>With regard to Red China, the Chancellor did not envisage diplomatic recognition on the
            part of Germany. Matters of this sort would be carefully coordinated with the United
            States. Trade relations with Red China were very limited. No expansion would be
            undertaken without advance consultation with the United States, both as to time and
            substance. Moreover, Germany did not anticipate the establishment of any trade
            commissions.</p>
                    <p>These were all the items the Chancellor wanted to take up with the President.</p>
                    <p>The President thanked the Chancellor for his visit. He expressed the high esteem in
            which the Chancellor is held in this country. As the Chancellor had said, Germany's
            problems were our problems, too. The United States did not intend to act in any of these
            important questions, including matters pertaining to the Communists, without carefully
            reviewing them with the Chancellor, if at all possible. The President was happy to hear
            what the Chancellor had said concerning the recognition of and trade relations with Red
            China. Talk of more trade with Red China would create very serious alarm among the
            American people. The President had not yet recovered from the shock he had suffered as a
            result of the British bus sales to Cuba.</p>
                    <p>(<hi rend="italic">Note:</hi> Part of this discussion submitted separately.)<note n="2" xml:id="d49fn2">See <ref target="#d50">Document 50</ref>.</note>.</p>
                    <p>The President stated that it was important that the Chancellor recognize the problem in
            the Middle East. He wanted to congratulate him and encourage him with respect to what he
            had said about the tank deal via Italy. The United States will give all possible aid in
            these matters. But the next 90 days will be critical ones for the United States and
            therefore Germany's help in working with Italy is most helpful and gives the United
            States great satisfaction. The President felt sure that it would be a long time before
            the true nature of the deal was recognized. In the meantime, it would be possible to
            extend a certain degree of aid to both Israel and the Arabs. This was the only
            intelligent way to handle the problem. Of course, the President indicated, this was only
            a drop in the bucket compared to the $300 million, in terms of which <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> had spoken to Nasser.</p>
                    <p>One matter of great concern to the American people was whether the German defense
            budget and planned foreign assistance would be adequate. Rumors had it that there might
            not be enough money to permit carrying out the <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_HKU1">Von Hassel</persName>
              agreement<note n="3" xml:id="d49fn3">See <ref target="#d38fn6">footnote 6&gt;
                Document 38</ref>.</note> and certain matters <pb n="114" xml:id="pg_114" facs="0144"/>discussed and agreed upon in the context of offset purchases which had
            been discussed at the Ranch in December and which were needed to help us maintain our
            six division presence to which we were committed. The President expressed the hope that
            these matters would not present a problem, because they would create very grave
            difficulties for us. Consequently, he hoped that these rumors were false.</p>
                    <p>The President indicated that no one could understand better than he matters of
            psychological pressure. Everyone was down on him at the present time because of the
            15,000 men stationed in Vietnam. He would not yield, however. Instead of bringing them
            home, as he was asked to do, he would increase their number. He could understand the
            problem created for the German people by the new treaty. Justified or not, he realized
            there would be a psychological reaction. This would not, however, weaken American
            determination to help solve the German problem and U.S. friendship and loyalty toward
            the German people. He had already instructed his people to work closely with the
            Chancellor's people on how to help the German psychological situation.</p>
                    <p>The President reverted to one matter about which the Chancellor had spoken earlier—the
              <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. The President appreciated what the Chancellor had
            said on this score and hoped it would proceed satisfactorily. The President then
            indicated that it might be better to join the others in the Cabinet room. He had
            expected to speak with the Chancellor only for about 15 minutes, but his desire to have
            frank and useful talk with the Chancellor had prompted him to lengthen this into more
            than an hour. The President expressed the hope that the Chancellor would have the
            opportunity during the further course of his visit to discuss matters of trade with
            Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName>,<note n="4" xml:id="d49fn4">See
                <ref target="#d55">Document 55</ref>.</note> matters pertaining to the treaty with
            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> (with whom the President had
            already discussed this problem), and matters pertaining to offset problems and tanks
            with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>.<note n="5" xml:id="d49fn5">See <ref target="#d53">Documents 53</ref> and <ref target="#d54">54</ref>.</note> The
            President himself would be glad to discuss anything else of interest to the
            Chancellor.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor then indicated that the offset agreements previously discussed should
            create no problem whatsoever. The Germans were ready to go through with what had been
            agreed upon and assume all responsibilities growing out of the U.S. presence in Germany.
            However, Germany did not want to discuss these matters too loudly. Germany feared that
            others, notably the British, would then approach Germany on the same score and it would
            be difficult to refuse them. The German trade balance was so excellent at the present
            time and there was such a surplus of orders that the Chancellor had already given the
            word that purchases <pb n="115" xml:id="pg_115" facs="0145"/>should be carried out in
            the United States as agreed upon. Consequently, there was no cause for concern.</p>
                    <p>The President then, half-jokingly, raised the question of meat and indicated that he
            might have to ship some Texas steer to Germany if Australia and New Zealand continued
            their dumping tactics in the United States.</p>
                    <p>The meeting was then adjourned to the Cabinet room.<note n="6" xml:id="d49fn6">According to a memorandum of conversation, the President and the Chancellor joined
                <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and Schroeder at 12:40 p.m. The President
              outlined the discussions with the Chancellor. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> then discussed

              <persName corresp="#p_EL1">ERHARD</persName>
                    </p>
                    <p>on June 12, in the presence of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WH3">Weber</persName> and Mrs.
            Lejins </p>
                    <p>The President indicated that the U.S. found itself presently in a very critical period.
            The first six months of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s
            administration had been extremely difficult ones. Leading Republicans, such as President
            Eisenhower, Nixon, Scranton, Romney and Senator Goldwater all were criticizing the part
            the United States plays in world affairs. They were apt to assume a martyr complex,
            complaining that no one loves us. The President assumed that this was only natural after
            20 years of post-war efforts. Last year President <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> had asked Congress for $5 billion in foreign aid and there had
            been a terrible fight and a great deal of criticism. This year the President was asking
            for much more.</p>
                    <p>The struggle in Southeast Asia had been going on for ten years by now. In the last few
            months, alone, there had been three governments in South Vietnam. Although it was
            perfectly obvious that the Communists were striving to swallow up Southeast Asia and
            that this was of concern to the entire world, the United States were the only ones who
            were really <pb n="116" xml:id="pg_116" facs="0146"/>attempting to do something about
            it. It was our men who were being killed and our planes that were being shot down.</p>
                    <p>We had been forced to greatly increase our national debt limit. Over $100 billion of
            all this money had gone into rebuilding other countries since the war. At the same time,
            France was causing great problems in Southeast Asia which also affected our own Cuban
            problem. The recognition by France of Red China was creating problems not only for the
            U.S. Government but was creating problems between the President and the American
            people.</p>
                    <p>Americans, to a degree at least, understand the British. England is sort of a mother
            country of us. Nevertheless, it is hard to swallow England's shipping materials to the
            Communists, selling busses and railroads to Cuba.</p>
                    <p>The President said he had a greater understanding now for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s poultry problems. Australia and New Zealand
            are flooding the country with meat, with a resultant drop from 30 cents to 15 cents per
            pound and from $300 per head of cattle to $150 per head. Consequently, all cattle
            breeders are mad at the President, complain of Australian etc. dumping and consider us
            stupid. They act as though this were the only problem the country is faced with and
            consider themselves a particularly abused and special class of martyrs; and the
            Republicans, of course, exploit this to the hilt.</p>
                    <p>In all, the President felt he could tell Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> the American people were ready to see someone else come to the
            rescue on the world scene and offer to carry some of the burden the United States had
            been carrying for these many years. This attitude would, of course, be reflected in the
            votes on certain issues in Congress, such as foreign aid. It also would be reflected in
            the coming elections.</p>
                    <p>The President indicated that he had recently met with Republican leaders and told them
            his problems.<note n="2" xml:id="d50fn2">Not further identified.</note> He had indicated
            that he would need more money to carry out U.S. policies in Southeast Asia. They had
            answered by asking him what other nations would help carry the burden. Therefore the
            President felt encouraged by what Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>
            had said in this respect and his indication that Germany was willing to help in
            Southeast Asia. This would be advantageous not only for Southeast Asia, but also for
            U.S. morale. The President indicated that he would remain, of course, resolute and firm
            is his convictions and actions. But he could not deny the fact that Mr. Goldwater was
            the one who would gain from any and all dissatisfaction arising in the United States.
            Anyone who had a complaint of any kind would join up with Goldwater.</p>
                    <p>The President then indicated that he felt very close to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> and that he had never told a similar thing to
            another statesman. He felt that both of them were fairly new at their jobs, having
            assumed their responsibilities <pb n="117" xml:id="pg_117" facs="0147"/>at about the
            same time. These responsibilities were very heavy ones. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> presently saw his chief problem in an attempt to unite the
            American people, and he was not at all sure whether he was the person to do it.</p>
                    <p>Very confidentially, he indicated that many decisions would have to be made within the
            next 60 days which would greatly affect the confidence of the people of the world. He
            would try to keep in touch with the Chancellor whenever it was possible on many of these
            questions. However, much of what needed to be discussed was as yet very unclear and very
            indefinite, and the President hoped that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> would consider any discussions of this situation as extremely
            confidential. He would then discuss further with him some of the problems of the United
            States.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor thanked the President for his show of confidence and friendship and
            indicated that he very much shared the President's feeling. He did not feel as close to
            any other statesman, either. Perhaps part of the explanation was that both of them,
            before very long, faced elections and both of them stood a pretty good chance of being
            re-elected. This, the Chancellor felt, was a factor greatly contributing to the
            stabilization of the world and of the further course of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> developments in particular. The Chancellor indicated that he could well
            understand the feeling of bitterness which the President felt in view of the fact that
            the United States had done so much to re-establish and maintain order in the world and
            to assist the reconstruction of many countries—both morally and materially—without
            getting much thanks of any kind. But that is life, the Chancellor felt, and creditors
            are never very popular. Once those who have been given help get back on their own feet
            they like to forget those who helped them. However, the Chancellor stated, he wanted it
            to be understood most emphatically that Germany would never forget what the United
            States has done on her behalf. This memory would never be wiped out. It formed the basis
            of Germany's loyal friendship for the United States, a few occasional false voices
            notwithstanding, who would make it appear as though there existed in Germany a de
            Gaullist party and a North Atlantic party in opposition to one another. This was not
            true. Germany was convinced of the fact that Europe itself had to build the strength of
            Europe and the German Bundestag was convinced of the fact that the alliance with the
            United States was a matter of life and death without which the German problem can never
            be solved. At the same time, Germany realized that this was the only way of achieving a
            solution and that it was a matter of slow process.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor then stated that he wished to express surprise at the fact that the
            President did not view the matter of the coming elections with more confidence in his
            power to win. The Chancellor stated that all over the world, certainly in Europe, there
            existed the expectation that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> would
            win and such victory was unquestioned. The Chancellor had found out, of course, that it
            was not an easy job the President had. In <pb n="118" xml:id="pg_118" facs="0148"/>addition to being the head of a Government—like the Chancellor himself—the President
            was also the head of the state. Although it was none of his business, the Chancellor was
            of the opinion that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> had greatly
            strengthened his position since he assumed office; that his leadership was undisputed
            and that the results of the elections were for all practical purposes assured.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor had spoken with Mr. Rockefeller yesterday,<note n="3" xml:id="d50fn3">Governor Rockefeller called on <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> at the
              Waldorf-Astoria Hotel after the Chancellor's arrival in New York.</note> whom he has
            known for many years. Mr. Rockefeller had expressed horror about the state of Republican
            affairs, and had indicated that in his opinion a Goldwater nomination would assure
              <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s victory and guarantee a split in the
            Republican party. The Chancellor felt obliged to say that recent Republican events had
            revived certain feelings in Europe that should long since have become a thing of the
            past. In any event, the impression created in Europe as the result of recent Republican
            developments was not a good one.</p>
                    <p>The President fully agreed and indicated that he had been much saddened by the course
            of recent events. He disagreed, however, about the Chancellor's evaluation of election
            prospects. He felt that it was too early even to tell who would be in the running, much
            less what the results would be. Only today Governor Scranton had announced his
            candidacy. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> had not yet made any
            announcement. Even if one assumed (and this was no foregone conclusion by any means)
            that Senator Goldwater and President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>
            would be the candidates, it would be extremely difficult to predict the outcome.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor stated that it was not possible to win elections with such a negative
            approach. Only a positive approach could achieve results. Both of them were experienced
            when it came to elections and the Chancellor had 16 years of experience in this area. He
            admitted that frequently things do not look too good in advance, but as an election
            comes closer people begin to change their minds and to get sense and vote as they
            should.</p>
                    <p>The President stated that he hoped the Chancellor understood his uncertainties with
            reference to the U.S. elections and even the matter of candidates. He urged the
            Chancellor to keep this discussion completely confidential since he had not even
            mentioned some of these misgivings to his own Cabinet members.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor assured him that he would.</p>

                    <p>While the President was in a private meeting with Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>,<note n="2" xml:id="d51fn2">See <ref target="#d49">Documents 49</ref> and <ref target="#d50">50</ref>.</note> the
            Secretary suggested to Foreign Minister Schroeder that they make use of the time to
            continue their discussions of June 11.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he had gathered from his conversation with Schroeder yesterday<note n="3" xml:id="d51fn3">Apparently during the private conversation that preceded their 4
              p.m. discussion; see <ref target="#d47">Document 47</ref>.,</note> that the West
            Germans were considering entering into some sort of trade agreement with Peiping at the
            governmental level. He had received the further impression that the Germans were
            thinking of doing this fairly soon. He would like to explore further Schroeder's ideas
            on timing. For our part we were concerned over any action which might be construed by
            Peiping as a go-ahead signal for continuing their present line of conduct.</p>
                    <p>Schroeder replied that, as he had indicated yesterday, this idea of increasing trade
            between the Federal Republic and Communist China and <pb n="120" xml:id="pg_120" facs="0150"/>formalizing this trade in some way was not a new one. It was of course
            true that the Germans had less freedom in their actions now because of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>'s recognition of Peiping. What particularly
            appealed to the Germans was the possibility of being able to secure a Berlin clause in
            any such agreement along the lines of those already included in trade agreements with
            countries of Eastern Europe. The Germans had no exact ideas on the matter of timing. All
            contacts thus far with the Red Chinese on the matter had been at the second level; there
            had been no real contact thus far at the government level. If developments indicated a
            definite interest on the part of the Red Chinese, then maybe something could be done “in
            the not too distant future”. There was no particular time pressure, but in the interest
            of maintaining momentum the Germans were thinking of trying to settle the matter “in the
            course of this year”. Trade agreements with a Berlin clause had already been signed with
            the countries of Eastern Europe except for Czechoslovakia. In this latter case
            conclusion of an agreement had already been unduly delayed, owing primarily to adverse
            reaction from Sudeten German groups.</p>
                    <p>Schroeder said the Germans did not want to do anything which would create a difficulty
            for the United States. However, they hoped that over the next two or three months there
            might be some easing of our problems in Southeast Asia. In any case the Germans would
            like “to settle things if possible this year”, because otherwise momentum would be lost
            and they would “lag behind the optimum”.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary expressed the hope that we could keep in close touch on this matter. It
            had a direct bearing on the current serious crisis in Southeast Asia. At the time France
            recognized Peiping, it had asserted that it had not been able to take this action
            earlier because of the unhelpful attitude of Peiping during French difficulties in
            Indo-China and Algeria. At the time the French did take action to recognize Peiping, we
            were ourselves suffering serious casualties in Southeast Asia. He wished to stress that
            any action which would encourage the Chinese Communists to believe they were on the
            right course would make things more dangerous.</p>
                    <p>Schroeder replied that the Germans were aware of this point. He said they were not
            particularly keen over increased trade in itself but they were keen over having a Berlin
            clause, particularly in the light of the Soviet-<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
            treaty signed in Moscow today. He felt that such a development would strengthen our
            common position against <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>.</p>

                    <p>At Foreign Minister Schroeder's request, the interpreter read a report on the speech
            made by <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> in Moscow today at the signing of
            the Soviet-<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance
            and Cooperation.<note n="2" xml:id="d52fn2">Not found with the source text. Extracts of
              the joint communiqué are printed in <hi rend="italic">Documents on Germany,

                    </p>
                    <p>Schroeder said he wished to draw particular attention to the passage in which <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> had stated that German unification was possible
            only through negotiations between the two German states, but that in such a case the
            treaty could be revised. Schroeder wondered whether this was part of the treaty itself
            or merely an interpretation of it by <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>. If
            it were the former, then maybe it could be regarded as a sort of alibi on the part of
              <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> for not taking any action on German
            reunification.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said we had just received a report from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> in Moscow on the delivery of the oral démarches to
            the Soviets about the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> treaty that had been agreed on in Washington yesterday.<note n="3" xml:id="d52fn3">Telegram 3740 from Moscow, June 12. (Department of State, Central
              Files, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 21 <gloss target="#t_GER1">GER</gloss>
                E–<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>) For text of the U.S. statement on the
              Soviet-East German agreement, see <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current
                Documents, 1964</hi>, p. 536.</note> The US, British and French démarches were being
            delivered separately in Moscow today. The three démarches did not include the sentence
            which had been suggested by the Secretary rejecting Soviet charges of German revanchism.
            The British in Moscow had objected to this sentence on the ground it was superfluous.
            The Secretary said that even so we could get this sentence back in the picture in our
            oral statements on the matter.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary continued that, with regard to <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>'s statement about “the only path to reunification”, he wondered
            to what extent this mention of reunification had been considered necessary by <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> from the standpoint of East German public
            opinion.</p>
                    <pb n="122" xml:id="pg_122" facs="0152"/>
                    <p>Schroeder said that in the past East Zone leaders had for many years claimed to be the
            champions of German unity. It was true the theme had been neglected for some time but
            they now seemed to be reactivating it. Possibly this was being done for the benefit of
            the young people in East Germany.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said we should be prepared for any follow-up on this assertion of “<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> sovereignty”. We should have the Ambassadorial Group
            review the situation and check our intelligence as to whether the agreement contemplates
            making any new difficulties on the Autobahn, for example in connection with the
            scheduled July 1 meeting in Berlin of the Bundesversammlung.</p>
                    <p>Schroeder said he felt that what was needed at this moment was a demonstration of a
            common position by the Three Powers. He pointed out that the démarches in Moscow had
            been delivered separately<note n="4" xml:id="d52fn4">For text of the démarche, see <hi rend="italic">Documents on Germany, 1944–1985</hi>, pp. 869–872.</note> and that the
            Three could not agree on the admirable sentence suggested by the Secretary. It was
            important that there be some sort of joint declaration by the Three that no impairment
            of Berlin access could be accepted. It might be desirable to move quickly since Pankow
            might wish to test Western resolution. The Three Powers would have to make quite clear
            that no changes in the Berlin situation could be accepted.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that after we had a chance to study the text of the treaty, there
            should be consultation among all four of us very quickly to consider the issuance of a
            joint statement. Such a statement might also be helpful in meeting the German problem
            about support for reunification.</p>
                    <p>Schroeder said he felt such a statement should be made on June 15 or 16. The Secretary
            agreed, but pointed out the difficulty of transacting business over weekends.<note n="5" xml:id="d52fn5">For text of the three-power statement, released on June 26, see

                    <p>State Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WL5">Westrick</persName> referred to the
            passage in the <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> speech describing West
            Berlin “as an independent political unit”. It would be a good idea for any joint
            statement to take issue with that statement, which was always coming up from the
            Communist side in the pass negotiations and other ways.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said we might have some problems with our Allies on this.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_WL5">Westrick</persName> said he could not imagine any real
            problem with the Allies, who had never said that West Berlin was an independent unit.
            Schroeder said he thought that we had already had formulas on this point that we could
            refer to. He agreed with Westrick that we should take a position on it. It would also be
            helpful for there to be a joint Allied statement about reunification. There had not been
            such a statement for some time.</p>
                    <pb n="123" xml:id="pg_123" facs="0153"/>
                    <p>The Secretary inquired if Schroeder attached any significance to the distinction
            between this treaty and a peace treaty. Schroeder replied in the affirmative. He said
            that a peace treaty would involve important arrangements in the field of European
            security, and these could not be undertaken as long as Germany was divided. The present
            treaty seemed to be a substitute, at least for the time being, for a peace treaty.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_WL5">Westrick</persName> inquired whether <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> had stated to the Secretary that the present
            treaty was not a peace treaty. The Secretary said that <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> had only read an oral démarche and had added no comment.<note n="6" xml:id="d52fn6">A memorandum of their June 8 conversation is scheduled for

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. Offset Agreement</p>
                    <p>Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> opened the discussion by
            referring to the offset agreements on military sales. He requested that the US not
            insist upon strict accounting and a balance sheet type of agreement signed by both
            parties. Such a rigid formula might become public and would cause others, for example
            the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, to claim similar treatment. The Federal
            Government was perfectly willing to assist the US in its dollar balance difficulties.
            The Chancellor stated two reasons for this. First, the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> balance of trade this year was favorable so that no difficulty was
            encountered on that score. Secondly, in light of the booming economic conditions in West
            Germany there were positive anti-inflation benefits to be gained by placing orders in
            the US. The Chancellor stressed the offset agreements were in the interest of both
            countries.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> agreed that the offset
            arrangement should not be made public, nor should they become a cause for <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> embarrassment vis-à-vis the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> or other countries. He questioned, however, the remarks of the Chancellor
            as they affected actual performance. While the US Government was grateful for past
            purchases of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, he was afraid that the size of the
            current <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> defense budget would not permit the purchase
            of a sufficiently large quantity of defense material to meet the need fully. The
            Chancellor replied that some purchases overlapped from one year to the next. Some years
            the amount might be more and some years less. It could be managed somehow so that the
            agreed amount of purchases were made. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said, “You have said you will do it and that is all we want. We
            don't have to have a written agreement.”</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Viet-Nam</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> expressed his appreciation
            for the German support for US policy in Viet-Nam. Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> said he had been impressed by the seriousness
            with which President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> had spoken to him on
            the questions of Southeast Asia and Cuba. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that these questions were not only important for the US but
            also for Germany and Western Europe. The danger lay in the loss of this area to the
            Communists. The reliability of the United States to carry out its treaty obligations and
            the danger to adjacent countries in that part of the world was also at stake. Chancellor
              <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> agreed that this was a bastion of the
            free world and that it would not be a good alliance if each partner were only concerned
            with those matters affecting its immediate geographic area. If freedom were threatened
            anywhere, the Chancellor said, it must be the concern of all members of the alliance. He
            was aware that freedom could easily be lost in Indonesia and elsewhere in Southeast
            Asia.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that he appreciated the
            medical unit which the Federal Government had said it would provide. The Chancellor
            noted, however, that this matter was still under consideration. The <pb n="125" xml:id="pg_125" facs="0155"/>Secretary emphasized that the next few weeks would be
            very important in Laos and Viet-Nam. Our planes had orders to fire if fired upon, and
            since we expected group fire, some exchange was inevitable. The Chancellor asked about
            the morale in Viet-Nam. The Secretary replied that while the bulk of the populace was
            still under the control of the Government, they have suffered heavy casualties in the
            past nine years, they were fatigued and concerned about the future. The Viet Cong had
            made substantial progress since October. Taking everything into account Vietnamese
            morale was quite good.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that more substantial action by the United States might be necessary
            in the months ahead. The Chancellor asked whether Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> felt anything could be gained from negotiations. The Secretary
            said, “No,” and the Chancellor quickly agreed. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> felt all was not black, however, since the Chinese Communists and
            the Viet Cong had problems of their own.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> noted that Hanoi has been
            silent with respect to the recent aircraft incidents, Peiping has not threatened force
            and delicate pressure should prevent further aggression.</p>
                    <p>In closing, the Secretary said that while the US would not expect military assistance
            from the Federal Republic, we would like to feel that we had support of the Germans for
            our policy in Southeast Asia. To this the Chancellor assented.</p>

              771–773.</note> After agreement had been achieved on the final text, Chancellor
              <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> remarked that we had now received the
            full text of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>-“<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>” treaty and asked what our reactions were.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> replied that after a first reading
            of the text, the treaty appeared to be what we expected—an attempt by <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> to give something to <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> without getting into the complexities of a peace
            treaty. He remarked that he was happy to see the language contained in Article 9 of the
              treaty.<note n="3" xml:id="d54fn3">It reads: “The present treaty does not affect the
              rights and commitments of the sides under the bilateral and other international
              agreements which are in force, including the Potsdam agreement.”</note> On the other
            hand, the Secretary said, we need to watch the situation carefully to see that no steps
            are taken on the basis of the treaty which might tend to reduce Allied rights.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> then stated he would like to
            express our concern about the situation in Cyprus.<note n="4" xml:id="d54fn4">Reference
              is to the mobilization of Turkish forces following the outbreak of intercommunal
              fighting.</note> As Foreign Minister Schroeder would recall, at the recent NATO
            meeting in The Hague it was agreed by all parties that war between Greece and Turkey was
            an unthinkable eventuality. The situation has now become more dangerous; the Turkish
            Cypriots seem to be in a more critical position. The Greek Government appears to fear
            employing its maximum pressure on Archbishop Makarios out of concern that Makarios will
            turn to the Soviet Union. The United States has been making representations to both
            sides. Our clear position is that there must be no war between the Greeks and the Turks,
            and that both sides must exert every possible influence to maintain law and order <pb n="127" xml:id="pg_127" facs="0157"/>and find an agreed solution promptly. We had had
            a very tight situation recently when the Turks were at the point of intervening
            militarily. Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s mission had
            been undertaken in order to insist in both capitals on moves to stabilize the situation.
            In view of this situation, we believe it is important for all NATO members to make clear
            in both capitals the nature of their concern. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said that we will keep in touch with the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> on this situation. We hope that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
            will insist firmly in Athens and Ankara on the idea that peace must be maintained.</p>
                    <p>Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> expressed his agreement with
            what Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> had said and asserted that the
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> will make further efforts to make reason
            prevail.</p>

            June 13 in response to question: “Does the United States consider that a unified grains
            price decision in the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> now is indispensable to the
            success of the <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> Round?”:</p>
                    <p>1. A unified grains price decision now is not indispensable as far as the United States
            is concerned. We believe that negotiations on industrial products, agricultural products
            other than grains, and even on grains, could be carried right up to the concluding stage
            in Geneva without a unified grains price decision, if the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> negotiator were in a position to negotiate on these matters.</p>
                    <p>2. In the view of the United States, the problem seems to lie therefore not in Geneva
            but in Brussels. It seems to have become an indispensable element in the internal
            bargaining situation with the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> that the unified
            grains price decision be made now and that in the absence of such a decision the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> representatives will be unable to enter into negotiations
            on virtually any matter in Geneva.</p>
                    <p>3. Unless the capabilities of the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> to negotiate on
            industrial products and on agricultural products including grains is restored in one <pb n="128" xml:id="pg_128" facs="0158"/>way or another, the timetable and even the final
            results of the <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> Round could be put in
            serious jeopardy. The preparations for the tabling of exceptions lists (which in the
            view of the United States must be done simultaneously for industry and agriculture) must
            be resumed at the latest by the end of the summer holidays if we are to meet the target
            date of November 16. In view of the already serious delays in the past, such further
            delays in the progress of the <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> Round would
            seriously endanger the negotiations. That would create a situation where the
            negotiations might well fail or at best be seriously impaired.</p>
                    <p>4. As far as the United States is concerned, the question of a unified grains price can
            in any case not be seen in isolation. While the United States wishes to see the lowest
            possible grains price in the Community, it is clear that any such price now being
            considered is so high as to require assurances for the maintenance of grain imports.</p>

                    <p>3590. Prior Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s departure from
            Washington June 13, Secretary handed him following message from President:</p>
                    <p>“Dear Mr. Chancellor:</p>
                    <p>As you leave Washington, I want to tell you how much I have appreciated even this brief
            opportunity to renew our friendship. Our talks on the problems which confront us have
            been as always most helpful to me, and I am convinced that they have further
            strengthened the firm bonds of friendship and understanding between our two
            countries.</p>

                    <p>I am mindful of the fact that a few days from now, on June seventeenth, you will be
            commemorating in the Federal Republic the Day of German Unity. As I told you here, it is
            a fundamental objective of American foreign policy to help bring an end to the unjust
            division of the German people, because otherwise there can be no real and durable
            stability in Europe. The Day of German Unity—June seventeenth—has therefore come to
            assume a special significance as we look forward to the day when German unity will
            become a reality. I take pleasure in sending you special greetings on this occasion.</p>
                    <p>Sincerely,</p>
                    <p>/s/ <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName>.”</p>

            would be no objection to publication of letter, with timing to be left to Germans.</p>

            when Germans plan publish letter in order similar release may be made here.</p>

                    <p>Following a call from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KD4">Klein</persName> at the White
            House, I told the Secretary of State that President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> was greatly disturbed by this article and by the fact that,
            according to information from our Embassy in Bonn (Bonn's telegram 4666)<note n="3" xml:id="d57fn3">Not printed. (Department of State, Central Files, PPV 7 <gloss target="#t_GER1">GER</gloss> W–US)</note> it was based on a briefing by the Federal
            Press Office. The President wanted someone to call Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> and ask him to go to see the Chancellor right
            away, expressing the President's concern at the origin and effect of this article, and
            asking if the German <pb n="130" xml:id="pg_130" facs="0160"/>Government could set the
            record straight right away. The Secretary then read the article and agreed that I should
            call Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> along the foregoing
            lines.</p>
                    <p>I reached Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> at about 10:15,
            apprised him of the situation and dictated to his secretary the most important and
            obnoxious passages of the article in question. The Ambassador, who had not seen the text
            of the article, expressed his dismay and concern that such an article could have been
            published at all, let alone the fact that it purported to reflect official German views.
            He said he would ask to see the Chancellor immediately. I also asked the Ambassador to
            tell the Chancellor that we would like to publish the President's letter to him of June
            13 and the Chancellor's own message to the President of the following day.<note n="4" xml:id="d57fn4">See <ref target="#d56">Document 56</ref>. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s reply is in Department of State,

            seeming to plead Moscow's case, we would point out that <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> behavior could be rationalized as calculated effort to reconcile internal

            West, including <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. Specifically, Moscow may have

            triggering Allied reaction resulting in crisis situation which Moscow obviously wished
            avoid. Moscow would undoubtedly find it difficult to maintain this posture of
            “restraint” if further Allied moves effected in such way as to compel vigorous
            rejoinder. In context struggle with Peiping, Sovs cannot afford to appear soft toward
            West and <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and weak in defense of a socialist ally.
            ChiComs apparently have already started flogging Moscow on issue and Soviet concern is
            reflected by Izvestiya June 16 attempted rebuttal of ChiCom charge that treaty did not
            change “one iota situation of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.” We not in position

              Council. (Department of State, German Desk Files: Lot 76 D 170, <gloss target="#t_POL1">Pol</gloss> 32–4 <gloss target="#t_GER1">Ger</gloss>),</note>
            causes us to offer the following comments and suggestions for consideration in any
            revision of the paper.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked why we could not take advantage of frequent Soviet statements (the
            most recent of which appeared in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> Treaty of Friendship of June 12) that reunification is an
            internal German problem and let the East and West Germans sit down and work things out
            for themselves. This points to one specific area in which the paper might probe more
            deeply; <hi rend="italic">the options available</hi> to US policy.</p>
                    <p>As the Secretary pointed out, we must attempt to find some way for the West Germans to
            talk with the East Germans without allowing the vexing recognition issue to arise as an
            immediate impediment. We know the East Germans would immediately seek to use
            negotiations as a vehicle for obtaining recognition. In this connection the question of
            whether the Federal Republic will deal with the Ulbricht regime or with a more appealing
            leadership that might emerge from an internal liberalization process is not really
            relevant. At least for the immediate future, no East German government can abandon or
            relegate to secondary position, the objective of obtaining co-equal status with the
            Federal Republic in any <hi rend="italic">bilateral</hi> talks.</p>
                    <p>A way to break out of this vicious circle, and to give more substance to the policy of
            movement in a manner acceptable to the West Germans, would be to establish a Four Power
            aegis under which East and West Germans could meet. As you know, the Ambassadorial Group
            has for some time been considering a West German Initiative on Reunification. One aspect
            of the German proposal is the creation of a Permanent Council of the Four Powers, the
            principal task of which would be to work out a <pb n="133" xml:id="pg_133" facs="0163"/>plan for phased reunification accompanied by corresponding measures in the field of
            European security. The Council is also to prepare in cooperation with “German agencies”
            an electoral law and to deal with “further measures” regarding the German question.</p>
                    <p>We suggest considering the desirability of proposing to the Germans—and the British and
            French—modifications to the plan whereby the subjects to be discussed by “German
            agencies” under the aegis of the Four Power Council would be expanded to include an
            agreed “list of issues” such as you suggested at the Planning Meeting. I believe a
            mandate from the Four Powers would largely remove the sting of the recognition issue
            from such East-West German discussions and would, therefore, be more palatable to the
            West Germans than the direct talks we are urging upon them. It would also serve to
            reaffirm the basic responsibilities of the Four Powers for reunification.</p>
                    <p>At least two elements add to the urgency with which this should be considered. As we
            read the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
            Friendship Treaty, one of its purposes is to reinforce the division of Germany and
            enhance the prestige of the East German government preparatory to possible new <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> initiatives vis-à-vis the Federal Republic. It would
            therefore be desirable to launch an initiative soon (the form in which this is done,
            i.e. as a tripartite document, is far less important than the substance of the move) and
            to pre-empt anything <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> may have up his
            sleeve. The fact that this is an election year in West Germany increases the odds that
            he will want to add fuel to a political campaign in which the reunification issue will
            inevitably come to the fore. The second element making for urgency is that quadripartite
            action on the German initiative has been slow. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> has pointed out it is possible that the French and British may go
            along with the German initiative and that we may be saddled with the onus of obstructing
            it.</p>
                    <p>We have, of course, no assurance the Soviets will agree to form such a Four Power
            Council. However, since they have been urging us to agree to joint East-West German
            discussions on reunification, they might find acceptable a proposal to bring about such
            discussions under Four-Power auspices. If they reject it, we have lost nothing. In
            addition to being responsive to the Secretary's desire to take them up on their past
            statements, we would (a) have buttressed our position vis-à-vis the West German
            Government by going along with its wish for action in the reunification field; (b) be in
            a favorable position to put the Soviets on the defensive on the German issue; (c) have
            placed the Federal Republic in a better position to reject <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> overtures that may come soon. If the Soviets accept, we will have brought
            East and West Germans together in a manner acceptable to the Bonn Regime and one that
            would not embarrass it in the eyes of the electorate.</p>
                    <pb n="134" xml:id="pg_134" facs="0164"/>
                    <p>While this proposal would give substance to the policy of movement vis-à-vis East
            Germany and fit in with our “détente” policy in a manner consistent with German
            objectives, we should also explore the possibilities of a West German policy of movement
            vis-à-vis the Eastern European satellites <hi rend="italic">other</hi> than the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. It is important to distinguish between these two
            policies, though we do not consider them to be mutually exclusive. Rather, we regard
            them as complementary. The purpose of a policy of movement vis-à-vis the <gloss target="#t_EE1">EE</gloss> satellites would be to stimulate polycentrist tendencies
            within the Bloc and to alienate the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> from the
            satellites. This is essentially Schroeder's policy and we should examine the
            desirability of pushing the Federal Republic further along this road. Already there has
            been some success in the economic agreements concluded between Bonn and some of the
            satellites. To the extent these contain “Berlin clauses” they directly contravene the
            political claims of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> in the Berlin question.</p>
                    <p>Any revision of the <gloss target="#t_SP1">S/P</gloss> paper might also examine the
            question whether a modification of the Hallstein Doctrine toward greater flexibility
            vis-à-vis <gloss target="#t_EE1">EE</gloss> satellites (other than the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>) would not be in our and the Federal Republic's long
            range interests. Similarly, a non-aggression pact between Bonn and Warsaw might go some
            way toward reducing Polish fears of West German revanchism and further isolate the
              <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. The West Germans might thereby succeed not only
            in driving a wedge into the Warsaw Pact; the more isolated the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> feels, the more telling West German pressures might become in the
            afore-mentioned East-West German dialogue.</p>
                    <p>In sum, we think the question is not whether a policy of movement is more desirable
            than the other two alternatives posited in the paper (Stabilization or Force Majeure),
            but what our options are within the policy of movement and where they would lead us.</p>

                    <p>47. For the President, Secretary and Under Secretary only. I called on the Chancellor
            today at his request. I had been told that he wished to inform <pb n="135" xml:id="pg_135" facs="0165"/>the President of the results of his meeting, held on July
            3 and 4, with General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d60fn2">They met July 3–4 at Bonn to discuss European defense and
              cooperation.</note> The Chancellor prefaced his remarks by stating that what he had to
            tell me was of such a confidential nature that he would appreciate it if I could by some
            arrangement see that the message I would send the President was destroyed after it had
            been read. If any of his confidential revelations of what had taken place in his talks
            with General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> became public, it would be
            extremely embarrassing to him. Although I did not commit precisely to such a procedure,
            I assured him that special precautions would be taken.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor continued that the talks had been “tough” ones. He had made it clear
            that he could not agree to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>'s concepts.
            He had told <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> that the decisive point for
            him was his relationship with America. He had said to de Gaulle that he (<persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>) seemed “to have the impression that we Germans
            are vassals to America. This is not true.” <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName> had attempted to persuade him that the American policy of détente
            would lead to the abandonment by the U.S. of efforts toward German reunification.
              <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> had attempted to persuade him
            otherwise. In a situation of tension there is less possibility that offers toward
            reunification would be successful. Without close ties with America, Europe has no
            protection. Germany would never renounce its ties with the United States.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> proposed that Germany and France should
            together develop a European policy. The Chancellor replied that this is fine, but why
            should there be any insurmountable differences between such a policy and American
            policy? For that matter, the whole free world should have similar policies. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> had pointed out some of the existing
            differences in policy—making particular reference to China. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> had explained the current American attitude
            toward China, pointing out that the situation in South-East Asia, in which China was
            deeply involved, was a matter of “life and death” for America. Under such circumstances
            he felt that Germany must be loyal to its ally. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName> had taken the line that the U.S. would inevitably become so involved
            in its contest with China, that we would seek an accommodation with the Soviets at the
            expense of the German problem. Germany must look to Europe for a solution to its
            problems.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> had repeated that Europe could not get
            along without the United States. In the event the U.S. withdrew, the Soviets would be
            tempted to make some adventure in Europe. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName> had not understood the U.S. and German objectives in seeking a
            détente.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor then proceeded to describe General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName>'s real views as to how he felt European unity could be achieved,
            which was basically <pb n="136" xml:id="pg_136" facs="0166"/>through the development of
            a much closer relationship (almost a union) between Germany and France with, he added as
            his own interpretation, “Germany as a vassal.” Germany and France would take the
            decisions, presumably with little consultation with others, who would then be “forced to
            their knees.” <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> had asked <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> how he could expect the smaller nations to
            accept such dictation. He pointed out that they would be in the same relationship to
            France and Germany that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> says Europe is
            to the U.S.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor reported that his private discussion with General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> was often “dramatic.” <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> had said, “We can unite Europe if you will only
            take a decision favorable to France. This is not possible because of your ties with the
            U.S.” <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> had replied, “Germany must have an
            alliance with the United States. However, this is not directed against France.” He
            pointed out to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> himself had, in their previous meetings,
            stressed that the Franco-German treaty was not directed against the U.S. and that he,
              <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>, had wanted an alliance with the U.S.
              <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> said he had told <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> that before Europe could act, as such, it must
            first unite. Germany and France could not act more closely in concert until they could
            reach a larger area of agreement on fundamental issues—such as <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. France appears to favor a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
            composed of national armies, whereas Germany prefers an integrated force. He asked
            General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> how Europe could be defended
            without a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> including the U.S.?</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor, in order to bring out de Gaulle's views, said that he had told de
            Gaulle that he assumed, after the U.S. election, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName> would wish to meet with President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>. At this time he would have to discuss the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> problem. What would he tell President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>? He characterized <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName>'s reply to this question as the first clear expression he had ever
            heard of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>'s real views. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> had replied that his concept involved the
            United States on the one hand, and a united Europe on the other strong enough to be an
            equal partner with the United States. An alliance would then be negotiated between the
            two providing for their mutual protection.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> had replied that he was anxious to help
            in developing such a plan, but what, for example, were de Gaulle's concepts of the plan
            in its strategic, financial and other specific aspects? Would it mean, for example, that
            France and Germany will in the future supply arms to Greece and Turkey that are now
            being supplied by the U.S.? Does he imply that there will be equal nuclear strength in
            Europe and the United States? Present U.S. nuclear strength is much greater than that of
            the force de frappe. If Europe insists on making its decisions independently, it is not
            realistic to expect America to continue to defend Europe. What would be the position of
            Europe in the meantime? What would constitute its nuclear <pb n="137" xml:id="pg_137" facs="0167"/>defense? Would the force de frappe be a European force, available for the
            defense of all of Europe, or a French force?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> had replied bluntly that it would be a
            French force. The Chancellor had responded that he would rather be dependent on the U.S.
            than France for Germany's nuclear protection. Sensing that his reply had been too
            absolute, General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> had then sought to
            soften it, saying that perhaps the U.K. would also make its nuclear force available to
            Europe. Perhaps there would be a European government which would control its own nuclear
            force. The Chancellor had replied that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
            Gaulle</persName>'s nationalistic approach precluded the creation of a European
            government. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> did not disagree with
            him.</p>
                    <p>At this juncture Minister <persName corresp="#p_WL5">Westrick</persName> intervened
            to comment that I should know that a <hi rend="italic">Die Welt</hi> article, written
            from Paris just before <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>'s visit, was
            known to have been inspired by <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>. This
            article had said in effect that all of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
            Gaulle</persName>'s efforts up to this point to unite Europe had failed. Presumably this
            was Germany's fault. The purpose of the article had, according to <persName corresp="#p_WL5">Westrick</persName>, been to prove that the only remaining
            alternative lay in what <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> had now
            proposed—a Europe based on closer German-French cooperation.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor, in response to my question, said that he and <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> had not discussed the Common Market nor the
            grain price question. This had been left for the Ministers concerned. The position of
            the U.K. had not come up either. If <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> comes
            in, he anticipated that Britain would probably not apply for membership in the Common
            Market. Although it was not said, he assumed de Gaulle would oppose U.K. entry in any
            event. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>'s ideas for the political unity
            of Europe seem to go beyond the Common Market. He seemed to feel that the group he was
            seeking could exclude some of the Six—and might include others outside the Six.
              <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> confided that he himself had sometimes
            wondered whether it would be necessary to include all of the Six in a European political
            union.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor admitted that the results of the discussions were meager. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> was not willing to take steps toward European
            political union along the lines Germany envisaged. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName> was not thinking even in terms of a revived Fouchet Plan,<note n="3" xml:id="d60fn3">Reference is to a plan for a draft treaty of a “Union of European
              States” developed in 1961 by an <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> Committee headed
              by Daniel Fouchet.</note> but a French-German (with Germany as a vassal) hegemony over
            Europe. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> was, however, not yet willing to
            give up, and had agreed with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> that their
              <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>s would study the unity question further
            between them and produce a draft which could be reviewed at a later date. When de Gaulle
            had mentioned to him the desirability of their coordinating their foreign policies, he
            had said, “You say you want to work out common foreign policies, <pb n="138" xml:id="pg_138" facs="0168"/>however, I hear of your policies only in the paper,”
            mentioning <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>'s policy toward China,
            Israel and the Arab states, and Greece and Turkey. “You are asking me to sign blank
            checks.”</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor then asked me rather abruptly whether we had any suggestions as to how
            we could improve our own relations with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
            Gaulle</persName>. He had been thinking that, after being rebuffed by him (<persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>), <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName> might as a tactic turn to the United States.</p>
                    <p>I replied that we would welcome an improvement in our relations with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>. President <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> had been disappointed not to have been able to meet with him
            following his visit to Germany. I felt sure that President Johnson would, after his
            election, be glad to meet with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> if it
            appeared that anything constructive could be achieved. Our impression, however, was that
              <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> was so inflexible on so many points
            of policy diametrically opposed to ours, that it would be impossible to reach agreement
            with him short of abandoning our policies. I assured him, however, that we would never
            reach an understanding with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> at the
            expense of the Germans or agree to let <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>
            speak for Germany or Europe.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor speculated that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>'s
            thinking might turn to a French-German-US–<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> grouping,
            whose leadership he thought the other European countries would accept. There was no
            reason why this could not be accomplished within <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.
            The Chancellor did not, however, appear to be proposing this himself.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: Although some reports about the impasse reached in the
            discussions between <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> are circulating around Bonn, not even Foreign
            Office officials appear as yet to have a detailed version of what took place. One
            report, probably accurate, is that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>'s
            relatively restrained attitude on Saturday morning was the result of his conversation
            with <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>, during which the latter asked that
            the French President take a less rigid and extreme position since adherence to the
            latter could only weaken that wing of the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_CSU1">CSU</gloss> which favored even closer Franco-German cooperation.</p>
                    <p>The President and Department may wish to consider a response to the Chancellor from the
            President, including as a minimum an expression of appreciation for his confidence. Such
            a response might, however, be utilized to convey substantive comment on some of the

                    <p>67. For Ambassador from <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">McGeorge Bundy</persName>.</p>
                    <p>1. The President asks you to call on Chancellor promptly to express President's deep
            appreciation for highly confidential message conveyed in your 47<note n="2" xml:id="d61fn2">
                            <ref target="#d60">Document 60</ref>.</note> and to convey following message in
            reply.</p>
                    <p>2. President is most grateful for the Chancellor's confidence and will insure that
            there is no disclosure of the contents of his message, or indeed of its existence.</p>
                    <p>3. On substance, the President finds himself in full agreement with views expressed by
            Chancellor, and in particular re-emphasizes his conviction that it can never be useful
            for Germany to be forced to a choice between France and the United States. We are all
            members of the same alliance. The US continues to believe that interdependence of Europe
            and America is inescapable reality upon which policy of all must be based. President
            believes that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>'s proposals to the
            Chancellor fly in the face of this reality, and that it is of highest importance that
              <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> should learn to recognize the
            firmness and rightness of the position the Chancellor put forward. Thus although
            President regrets any argument among allies, he cannot but send his thanks to Chancellor
            for the position he stoutly and clearly set forth to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName>.</p>
                    <p>4. You can reassure Chancellor once more that US would welcome an improvement of
            relations with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> and will always be ready
            for serious discussion with France. Moreover, US will not squabble publicly with de
            Gaulle. At the same time Chancellor can be quite sure, as you have already said, that
            the US will never make any private agreement with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName> or anyone else at expense of Germans. Nor can US regard the General
            as spokesman for Europe.</p>
                    <p>5. President hopes that as time passes it may be possible to make new beginnings toward
            stronger partnership, always with room for France and never with any thought of
            exclusiveness. This is immediate value of <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, and the
            President repeats his belief that it will be important to move ahead promptly with this
            major undertaking in the last months of 1964.</p>
                    <p>6. If there should be any fresh prospect of wider agreement among Germany, France, US,
              <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and Italy, President would gladly lead new <pb n="140" xml:id="pg_140" facs="0170"/>and strong effort by all to move forward. Please
            note inclusion of Italy, whose solidity in Alliance needs constant attention.</p>
                    <p>7. The President values your prompt and comprehensive report of Chancellor's
            extraordinarily revealing conversation and sends thanks.</p>

            Bavaria tomorrow, and in his meeting with Barzel and other <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> party leaders Monday. The Chancellor expressed interest in the
            President's suggestion for increased emphasis on Atlantic partnership and prospects for
            an initiative by the President on a wider agreement among Germany, France, the U.S.,
            U.K. and Italy. His immediate reaction was favorable, however, he would give thought to
            the matter and discuss it further with me on Monday.</p>

                    <p>Other information provided by <persName corresp="#p_WL5">Westrick</persName> may be
            of interest in put-ting together the fast-moving picture here. <persName corresp="#p_WL5">Westrick</persName> said that the Chancellor, who was in Denmark
            at the time, was greatly disturbed by the meeting between <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> on Monday,
            despite the fact, as we know, that <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> really
            tried to calm <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> down. The public did not
            know this, and the press subsequently built up the concept of an attack against
              <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> by an <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName>-Dufhues grouping.
            This is why the Chancellor struck back even while still in Denmark, and why he saw
              <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> immediately upon his return Wednesday
            morning. He had found <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> in quite a
            conciliatory mood. Together they had, at <persName corresp="#p_WL5">Westrick</persName>'s suggestion, called <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName>, with <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> telling
              <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> not to “beat the drum.” Strauss had
            replied indignantly that he had no intention of “beating the drum” and his speech in

            fact do so.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_WL5">Westrick</persName> said that the foremost point of
                            irritation on the part of the French, particularly <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve de Murville</persName>, during the talks, seemed to be German support of U.S. policy in
            South Vietnam. Couve characterized German policy as a “satellite policy.” The Germans
            had, however, remained firm on the basis of their loyalty to the U.S.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_WL5">Westrick</persName> said that the Chancellor had, since
            his return, been provided ample evidence of the overwhelming national backing that he
            had in pursuing his present policy line. Yesterday the leaders of German industry,
            including Fritz Berg, head of the Federation of German Industries, and Dr. Schneider,
            head of the German Chamber of Commerce, called on the Chancellor to assure him of the
            support of the business community. According to <persName corresp="#p_WL5">Westrick</persName>, the group in opposition is now really negligible—and without
              <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> has no force.</p>

            ambit of Atlantic partnership with the U.S. The strong support of the President, as

                    <p>Dear Mr. Secretary:</p>
                    <p>When the Attorney General was here recently,<note n="2" xml:id="d63fn2">The Embassy
              reported on <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Robert Kennedy</persName>'s June 25 visit to
              Bonn in telegram 4867, June 26. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 32–4
                <gloss target="#t_GER1">GER</gloss>)</note> both <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> and Schroeder made a point of speaking to him about their interest
            in improving relations with Poland, and their hope that he might be able to put in a
            word for the Federal Republic while in Warsaw. They admitted that their difficulty with
            regard to the Poles lay in their inability to give assurances with respect to the
            Oder-Neisse frontier. The Chancellor said that the Germans could not hand over to the
            Poles the Oder-Neisse territory on a golden tray, since according to the Potsdam
            Agreement the 1937 frontiers were valid until the peace treaty was signed. The
            Chancellor added that it was implicit, however, that the new frontiers would not be the
            old frontiers.</p>
                    <p>As can be gathered from the press accounts (which is all that we have received), the
            Attorney General has done yeoman's work in Poland<note n="3" xml:id="d63fn3">
                            <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> visited Poland June 27–July 1.</note>
            by his public references to the urgency of overcoming the division in Europe following
            from the division in Germany, and by intimating that in his opinion a way could be found
            to settle the frontier question satisfactorily. The Germans have been very grateful for
            this. It has been commented upon by the press, by officials to me personally, and by a
            number of high ecclesiastics who were at the Papal Nuncio's reception recently. It has
            set me thinking—indeed crystallized a feeling that I have had for some time—that
            conceivably we might, through <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Foy Kohler</persName>, be able
            in Moscow to do something toward the same end.</p>
                    <p>The question of whether we could do something—by quiet private talks, more or less
            directed towards planting a seed—is easier to answer than the question of what precisely
            we would put up to the Soviets. I have no illusions about the political and
            psychological difficulties which have brought about the impasse during the past 19
            years. In essence the problem is whether there is anything which can be done which would
            lead Moscow to take a more friendly attitude toward Bonn.</p>
                    <p>I am well aware, for example, of the obstacles here to any significant actions by the
            Germans on their frontier problem, such as a relinquishment of the hypothetical legal
            claim to the Oder-Neisse territories which is still stubbornly maintained by all
            elements in Germany. I can easily <pb n="143" xml:id="pg_143" facs="0173"/>imagine the
            questions about this and other issues that would confront <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Foy</persName> during his discussions in Moscow. All the same, the more I reflect
            about it, the more I am convinced that these people are still victims of a false
            perspective, a perspective which may have had some validity a dozen years ago, but with
            each passing year becomes more unrealistic—and that they will in time see this.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet leadership will undoubtedly continue to evaluate its relationships with
            “capitalist” countries in terms of Communist ideological and tactical considerations.
            This would presumably apply to the Federal Republic as well as to us. However, there
            have been indications in recent years that <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> is willing to adopt a somewhat more flexible approach in his
            relations with certain key countries, without regard to whether these relations may seem
            entirely consistent with the long-run goal of establishing the Communist system
            throughout the world.</p>
                    <p>As you know, the Germans, despite their stress on the continuing Communist menace and
            the argument made by many that the Soviet Union rather than Communist China remains the
            primary menace to the free world, are quite willing to consider ways and means of
            improving their relations with the Russians. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>, for example, continues to toy with the notion that German economic
            resources can somehow be brought to bear in a favorable way to move towards the solution
            of the reunification problem. I know that the Department does not consider this
            feasible, but perhaps there is some hope in a step-to-step approach which might at least
            lead to a bettering of relations between the Federal Republic and the Soviet Union and
            the end of mutual name-calling.</p>
                    <p>What I have in mind is that by a process of very careful exploration, by <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Foy</persName> in Moscow and by me in Bonn, we might plant the
            useful idea that the Federal Republic is interested in improving its relations with the
            Soviet Union, is even prepared to pay a certain price for this and that consequently, at
            least in part, the admittedly sincere Soviet fears of the Federal Republic might bear
            reexamining.</p>
                    <p>We might, first of all, attempt to persuade the Soviets that present-day Germany is not
            militaristic—nor in any way controlled by militarists. It might, for example, be
            suggested that the present agitation in the Federal Republic over its armed forces,
            precipitated by the Heye Report,<note n="4" xml:id="d63fn4">Reference is to statements
              in the annual report of the Federal Parliament's Defense Commissioner, retired Admiral
              Heye, criticizing “excessive elite consciousness” in the military.</note> is a healthy
            sign of both popular and governmental concern. Propaganda aside, the new German army is
            not simply a latter-day model of the old imperial or Nazi army. It places special
            emphasis on the role of the individual in a “citizen” army. They have a special
            institute and training in <pb n="144" xml:id="pg_144" facs="0174"/>this concept. All
            German forces are fully integrated into <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, and their
            role is conceived of as purely defensive. We are in a position to vouch for the fact
            that the Federal Republic has no aggressive intentions and that there is neither
            governmental nor popular support for any adventuristic policy.</p>
                    <p>It might also be pointed out that the Federal Republic continues to grow rapidly in
            economic prosperity and has become one of the foremost trading nations of the world. It
            is prepared to expand its trade relations, on a basis of mutual interest, with the
            countries of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. It might be noted that there are
            obvious limits to what can be done here, but that the German attitude appears reasonable
            and does provide a basis for improved relations (we would not at this point, of course,
            want to get into the subject of long-term credits).</p>
                    <p>Another point which might be made is that the Federal Republic has renounced the use of
            force to effect any changes in national frontiers or demarcation lines. This, in our
            view, is a solid and lasting commitment, and propaganda implying that the Federal
            Republic is in the hands of militarists who are ready to spring at any moment is both
            unrealistic and self-defeating. Such propaganda cannot really be taken seriously as an
            estimate either of German capabilities or of German public opinion and the intentions of
            its leaders.</p>
                    <p>It might be stressed that a very convincing proof of the real attitude of the Federal
            Government to Germany's Nazi past is the fact that the Government has, in a spirit of
            contrition and reparation, sponsored programs involving the expenditure of many billions
            of marks in an effort to make restitution to victims of Nazi persecution. These programs
            continue up to the present and have recently been supplemented by new legislation.</p>
                    <p>I will, of course, be willing to do anything in Bonn which might be useful to
            supplement what Foy does in Moscow. I should welcome receiving any thoughts or advice
            you may have on the feasibility of this approach. I have taken the liberty of sending a
            copy of this to <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Foy</persName>, with the suggestion that he
            comment directly to us both.</p>

                    <p>166. Eyes only for: the Secretary, Under Secretary, Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName>. From Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName>. In my meeting yesterday with FonMin Schroeder at his vacation
            residence on the Island of Sylt, he asked that I convey to the Secretary his regret, not
            only because of the problems for the US but also for the added burdens for the Secretary
            personally, that have been created by the North Vietnamese attack on our naval
              vessels.<note n="2" xml:id="d64fn2">Reference is to the Gulf of Tonkin incidents,
              August 2–4.</note> He wanted to assure the Secretary of his strong personal support,
            as well as that of the German Government.</p>
                    <p>In a long talk with the <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> over much of the
            afternoon, he gave me some insight into his personal situation which might be of
            interest. Schroeder, who has since the <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>
            visit of July 3–4 been under constant attack from the Gaullist wing of the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CSU1">CSU</gloss>, advised that he
            had last week met with Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> for two
            hours and had, he believed, made peace with him. Indeed, he feels that he is now in
            better graces with <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> than is <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>, whom <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> has never ceased to disparage and undercut.</p>
                    <p>Schroeder did not consider that any issue of importance remained between himself and
              <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> arising out of the latter's views
            toward <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> and France. He had assured
              <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> that he would, in his quest for
            European unity pursuant to the undertaking made during the <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> visit, propose no development of supranational
            institutions—since he knows <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> would never
            approve. When I queried him as to what he would propose he was not clear, but indicated
            some embellished form of the Fouchet Plan. Although he has not mentioned it to the
            Chancellor he is considering visiting the various capitals of the Six in order to
            determine what area of agreement for political unity exists before submitting his final
            proposals.</p>
                    <p>Schroeder feels that although basically orientated towards <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> and France, <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> by no
            means follows slavishly all of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>'s
            policies. <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> is, for example, still for the
              <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. In Schroeder's view it is, however, most
            unfortunate that <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> was chosen as head of
            the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> party, which greatly complicated his and
              <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s problems.</p>
                    <p>Schroeder feels that the French will step up their campaign against the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, seeking to persuade the Germans that they can rely on
            the force <pb n="146" xml:id="pg_146" facs="0176"/>de frappe. He asked me, in this
            connection, to provide him convincing answers to the impressive arguments the Gaullist
            elements in Germany are presently using in favor of the force de frappe. I will take
            this matter up separately with Jerry Smith.</p>
                    <p>Schroeder expressed no particular concern over his relations with Erhard, although it
            is obvious that there is not very close coordination—perhaps not even much
            rapport—between the two. He had, for example, not been advised that the Chancellor had
            responded to the President's letter.<note n="3" xml:id="d64fn3">President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> exchanged communications over the Gulf of Tonkin incidents,
              August 4 and 6, respectively. Texts are in Department of State, Presidential
              Correspondence: Lot 66 D 204, Germany.</note> This is but one of many examples that we
            find that the Chancellery, run by Minister Westrick who has a tendency to handle matters
            himself, operates to a very large extent in isolation from the <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss>.</p>

                    <p>Dear <persName>George</persName>:</p>
                    <p>We have read with interest your letter of July 21<note n="2" xml:id="d65fn2">
                            <ref target="#d63">Document 63</ref>.</note> setting forth certain suggestions as to
            what might be done to try to help improve relations between the Federal Republic and the
            Soviet Union. We have also noted your supplementary comment in Bonn's 370 of July 29,
            and <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Foy Kohler</persName>'s observations on the subject in
            Moscow's 364 of August 3.<note n="3" xml:id="d65fn3">Neither printed. (Department of
              State, Central Files, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_GER1">GER</gloss> W–<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>)</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>We definitely agree, of course, that an improvement in relations between the Federal
            Republic and the Soviet Union is a very desirable goal and something which, within the
            limits of our resources, we should continue <pb n="147" xml:id="pg_147" facs="0177"/>discreetly to work for. An important part of the problem, as you suggest, is to try to
            correct some of the misconceptions and misimpressions which appear to exist in the minds
            of the Soviets about the true state of affairs in the Federal Republic. The Adzhubei
            visit may well have, as you indicate, served a useful purpose in this regard, and the
            same might be true of a <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> visit to the
            Federal Republic should this materialize.</p>
                    <p>As for what we can do ourselves in this area, I think there are certain limitations on
            our capabilities. I am impressed by the point made by <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Foy</persName> that in the final analysis the Soviets are not so much interested in
            what we might ourselves say or think about the Germans as they are in what the Germans
            say and do themselves. Furthermore, the extent of the Soviet commitment to <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> &amp; Co. will probably make it difficult for
            Moscow to move very far in the direction of conciliation with Bonn, even with <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> rather than <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> as Chancellor.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, I agree fully with you that this is a subject of great importance and
            that we should continue, in our contacts with the Soviets and Germans, to do what we can
            to help improve at least the atmospherics in <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>/Soviet
            relations. I feel sure, for example, that there will be opportunities for improvement in
            East/West relations to which the Federal Republic could contribute, through
            collaboration with us and by initiative of its own.</p>
                    <p>I am happy to note that you and <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Foy</persName> will be
            getting together in the near future to talk, among other things, about the ideas set out
            in your July 21 letter. I shall await with interest the further views of you both.</p>
                    <p>Thanks also for your letter of July 25<note n="4" xml:id="d65fn4">Not printed. (Ibid.,

              (Ibid.)</note> The following represents our current thinking on the general question
            of Germany's eastern boundary. We have benefited from a discussion on this subject
            during the past few days with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName>.
            The Dept's study (Research Project No. 677 of April 1964)<note n="3" xml:id="d66fn3">See
                <ref target="#d28fn6">footnote 6, Document 28</ref>.</note> on the US position on
            the Oder-Neisse line is also most useful. We have read it closely and think it will be
            of continuing value. As a matter of historical interest, it might also be noted that
            President <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName>, in his press conference of
            April 12, 1961,<note n="4" xml:id="d66fn4">For text, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers
                of the Presidents of the United States: John F. Kennedy, 1961</hi>, pp.
              258–264.</note> reaffirmed the view that fixing of the German eastern border would
            have to await a peace treaty.</p>
                    <p>In reviewing German developments on this matter since Embtel 2432 and <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 2026 in January, I think that events have supported
            the main conclusions of those messages, i.e. that Schroeder is trying to underplay the
            issue, that the German Govt will adhere to its position of not making unilateral
            concessions prior to a peace treaty (although there is no realistic expectation of
            Germany being able to negotiate more than marginal border adjustments and concessions),
            and that our best policy is to avoid public statements about the subject. At the same
            time, some political movements have occurred in this field, not all of it unfavorable.
            The past six months have in fact brought about two distinct but connected
            developments.</p>
                    <p>The favorable development has been the increased recognition and public discussion,
            primarily in intellectual and student circles, of the probability that Germany will not
            regain her former eastern territories. We should not, however, overestimate the impact
            of this trend in terms of a change in the German position. In the absence of
            reunification, a real change might well take close to a generation to evolve. In
            addition, the govt has clarified (as much as it is apt to) its position on the 1938
            Munich agreement by acknowledging its abrogation by Hitler, and by disclaiming any
            territorial designs on Czechoslovakia.</p>
                    <pb n="149" xml:id="pg_149" facs="0179"/>
                    <p>The foregoing has not been an unmixed improvement, as it has set off a counteraction of
            expellee backlash. The extent of the latter is hard to judge, but its expression is
            harsh and loud. Minister Seebohm's statements in Nuernberg were a good example. The
            Embassy has also reported such recent moves as the proposal for a Sudeten “march on
            Bonn,” warnings that the league of expellees is turning “soft,” and disgruntlement with
              <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>'s position on the eastern frontier
            (Embassy's A–292).<note n="5" xml:id="d66fn5">Airgram A–292 from Bonn, August 6,
              reported on resentment against <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> on the
              part of Sudeten Germans. (Department of State, Central Files, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 13 <gloss target="#t_GER1">GER</gloss> W)</note> Despite this reaction,
            however, the current attention to the eastern border problem is not in my judgment, a
            major or growing factor in German national life.</p>
                    <p>With a close election in the offing, however, it could become, at least temporarily, a
            field of political rivalry which could adversely affect the growing German potential to
            influence the future course of events in Eastern Europe. Unfortunately, the problem
            posed by expellee unrest is most difficult for those German moderates who are our
            natural allies in trying to “defuse” it. Much of the animus of the current upswing, for
            instance, is directed against FonMin Schroeder, who has been suspect in expellee circles
            ever since June 28, 1963, when he delimited restoration of the right of
            self-determination “to our countrymen in the Soviet Zone.” Expellee activity cuts across
            all three parties; the expellee leaders (Rehs and Jaksch) of the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> are as impervious to party discipline on this score as are intransigents
            (Neuwir) in the <gloss target="#t_CSU1">CSU</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>As for American policy, we can of course, hardly change our formal position on the
            Oder-Neisse line. It is now too deeply embedded, although the original ethnic and
            economic (foods and jobs) justification for our 1945 reserve<note n="6" xml:id="d66fn6">Documentation regarding the U.S. reserve is in <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                Relations</hi>, 1945, The Conference at Potsdam, vol. I, pp. 744–745, and vol. II,

              of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, August 12, 1945, pp. 210–211.</note> about
            the line itself no longer obtains, there is in any event, little need for such a change,
            since our position is only procedural and does not bind us as to specific lines on a
            map. Although we might review the situation after the 1965 elections, there appears to
            be no room at the present for maneuver in this area. We can however, as we have since
            Secretary Marshall, give no new public impression that we envisage any specific
            territorial adjustments (nor should we deny this possibility).</p>
                    <p>What I would propose to undertake, with suitable caution, is to spread the idea in
            responsive govt and party circles that a moratorium on discussion of this issue would be
            desirable in the 12-month period before the elections. Although expellee agitation could
            not be totally silenced, it would still be worthwhile to stimulate govt spokesmen and
            major party <pb n="150" xml:id="pg_150" facs="0180"/>leaders to soft pedal, or so far as
            possible to bury it, the issue during the forthcoming campaign. The election atmosphere
            could easily exacerbate the issue. Although it is a matter of primarily minority
            interest, this minority could potentially supply the 5–10 percent vote shift that the
              <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> are
            competing for.</p>
                    <p>Our line in achieving this might be as follows:</p>
                    <p>1) In explicit US statements, we would discuss reunification only in the context of the
            Zone. We would avoid any reference to or acceptance of the concepts of East and middle
            Germany.</p>
                    <p>2) We would avoid volunteering any public restatements of our formal position on the
            Oder-Neisse line. When queried we would express adherence to the Potsdam Agreement but
            in minimum terms and low key.</p>
                    <p>3) In private discussions:</p>
                    <p>(A) We would note that the formal US position on the line is procedural (i.e.
            negotiating it finally in a peace settlement) rather than substantive, and that in fact
            we are committed to support some “accession (to Poland) of territory in the north and
            west.”</p>
                    <p>(B) Try to create a general atmosphere of discouragement that the Germans can
            realistically gain territory. We would emphasize the improbability of any substantial
            German recouping in the area beyond present borders, since force is ruled out and it is
            unlikely to be achieved through a voluntary Polish surrender. Emphasize that neither we
            nor anyone else would ever be willing to fight for return of this territory.</p>
                    <p>4) In private conversations, we should urge on the Germans a moratorium on domestic
            discussion of the issue.</p>
                    <p>5) Finally, we should emphasize privately that continued agitation on this question is
            a drag on German reunification policy. In view of the continued close Soviet/<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> connections, the best possibilities now are in the
            direction of expanding German influence in East Europe, and isolating <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> in his own camp. Implications that Germany aims
            at crippling Poland or Czechoslovakia can only tighten Soviet ties with these two
            nations, which together with Pankow bond, would thus continue to provide an extensive
            framework for continued Soviet predominance over East Europe. It is, however the
            retirement of frustration of this hegemony by gradual and natural processes, which can
            provide the only conceivable basis for eventual reunification.</p>
                    <p>In advancing the foregoing, I would naturally be highly selective in conversation
            partners. There would be no suggestion of an official campaign, any press leaks of which
            could seriously backfire. In general we should try to be casual and conversational, and
            to the greatest degree possible endeavor to implant the idea in the other person in such
            way as to suggest that it accords with, or originated in, his own thinking. In spite of
            the sensitivity of the problem, it should be noted that there already exists <pb n="151" xml:id="pg_151" facs="0181"/>a rudimentary awareness of the desirability of keeping
            the issue out of domestic politics, as evidenced by Brandt's proposal, which was
            accepted by the other two parties, that a three-party position should be taken with this
            aim on the Munich Agreement. There are thus good chances that some responsible political
            figures would be receptive, and I recommend that we try the approach since any gains in
            this sense would be positive in terms of our overall German and European objectives.</p>
                    <p>During his visit Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> inquired
            whether the Germans might be persuaded to offer the pledge that if they obtained
            reunification any future all-German govt would acquiesce in the present Eastern border
            in peace settlement. He pointed out such a move would permit a new relationship with
            Poland, and would focus energies and attention on reunification rather than the frontier
            question. I certainly agree that this would be the best interim solution, and it is
            furthermore likely, if any future German policy change occurs, that it would take just
            this form. There is, however no present party or governmental enthusiasm for the idea
            (which was first broached prominently in 1963) and it is too early to estimate the
            possibilities for such a step in 1966. Here again it becomes a question of quid-pro-quo.
            The Germans are reluctant to yield any bar-gaining power no matter how fractional, which
            conceivably could be of cumulative significance at a peace conference.</p>

                    <p>Dear Mr. Secretary:</p>
                    <p>You will recall that during your talk with Governing Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Willy Brandt</persName> in Washington last May<note n="2" xml:id="d67fn2">See <ref target="#d40">Document 40</ref>.</note> he indicated that he would try to put on
            paper some of his thoughts regarding Western relations with the countries <pb n="152" xml:id="pg_152" facs="0182"/>and peoples of Eastern Europe. Mayor Brandt mentioned
            this conversation to me shortly after his return from Washington and has subsequently
            said from time to time that he was working on the paper.</p>
                    <p>Brandt has now forwarded this paper to me with a request that it be sent on to you and
            a copy retained by the Mission. I therefore enclose the original German text<note n="3" xml:id="d67fn3">The German text was not found.</note> and the original and two copies
            of an English translation prepared by an officer in the Mission. The Governing Mayor
            said during our last conversation that he was not coming up with any new and startling
            ideas but that he hoped his thoughts might be useful to you. If there is any word that
            you would wish me to convey back to him, I shall of course be happy to do so.</p>
                    <p>It was both pleasant and helpful for me to have a brief conversation with you in
            Washington during the day that I was there in early June.<note n="4" xml:id="d67fn4">Apparently June 11–12 when <persName corresp="#p_CJA1">Calhoun</persName> accompanied
              the <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> party to Washington.</note> I hope
            that there may be an occasion for a further meeting before too many months pass,
            although I realize that you are deeply immersed in many other more critical and urgent
            problems.</p>
                    <p>Major General Franklin, the new US Commandant here, spoke with warmth and appreciation
            of his meeting with you and other high Department officials in Washington a few weeks
              ago.<note n="5" xml:id="d67fn5">Not further identified.</note> He has now taken over
            officially and seems to be getting his feet on the ground very rapidly.</p>
                    <p>I am sure that our relations with him will be as friendly and mutually fruitful as they
            were with General Polk.</p>
                    <p>With warm personal regards.</p>

                    <p rend="center">I.</p>
                    <p>In increasing measure, Western political thought proceeds from the premise that the
            Eastern European Communist states can no longer be <pb n="153" xml:id="pg_153" facs="0183"/>regarded as mere satellites of the Soviet Union. The effect of the
            Soviet/Chinese controversies, and the process of economic and ideological
            differentiation (not directly related to the first) are being observed with great
            interest.</p>
                    <p>Questions of communication with Eastern European states and peoples, of practical
            cooperation, and of appropriate political action, have begun to play a larger role. It
            may be assumed that the incipient union of free Europe, despite all difficulties and
            obstacles, has exercised a strong attraction, and that an all-European consciousness has
            survived or been revived in the peoples located between Germany and Russia.</p>
                    <p>In his Lexington speech of May 23, 1964,<note n="7" xml:id="d67fn7">For text, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States: <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName>, 1964</hi>, Book I, pp.
              708–710.</note> President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> spoke of an
            “all-European” perspective. President <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName>
            told the Berlin students on June 26, 1963<note n="8" xml:id="d67fn8">For text, see
              ibid.: <hi rend="italic"> John F. Kennedy, 1963</hi>, pp. 526–529.</note> that it was
            “not too early to think once again in all-European terms;” the “winds of change,” he
            said, are blowing across the Iron Curtain. The interests of French and British policy in
            this problem area are obvious. Thus, the French Foreign Minister observed on April 28,
            1964 before the National Assembly that the countries of Eastern Europe had already made
            use of the Soviet/Chinese conflict in order to accelerate their already marked tendency
            towards emancipation.</p>
                    <p>In his 1964 New Year's broadcast,<note n="9" xml:id="d67fn9">For text, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">Charles de Gaulle</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Discours et
                Messages</hi>, vol. 4, pp. 159–160.</note> General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName> said that without engaging in illusions, one must be prepared for
            the day when in the Eastern European capitals the totalitarian Communist regime might
            undergo a gradual process of change. “Then perspectives would open up for all of Europe
            which would be in keeping with its means and capabilities.”</p>
                    <p>On June 26, 1963 Lord Home declared in the House of Lords<note n="10" xml:id="d67fn10">For text, see <hi rend="italic">House of Lords Debs</hi>., 5th series, vol. 251,
              cols. 277–292.</note> that there were numerous indications for the beginnings of a new
            mood: “Country upon country in Eastern Europe begins to question the right of the Soviet
            Government to dictate its forms of economic development … No one can foretell the future
            with certainty, but there is evident a possible development which will have to be
            observed with the greatest care.”</p>
                    <p>In its Bonn declaration of June 1, 1964,<note n="11" xml:id="d67fn11">For text, see <hi rend="italic">Europa Archiv, 1964</hi>, vol. 2, pp. 339–347.</note> the Action
            Committee for the United States of Europe (Monnet Committee) advocated that “the
            beginnings of communication with the nations of Eastern Europe should be strengthened
            through realistic endeavors.”</p>
                    <pb n="154" xml:id="pg_154" facs="0184"/>
                    <p>This, therefore, is the theme: For the immediate future it appears desirable and not
            unpromising to engage the Eastern European states in the largest possible volume of
            communications.</p>
                    <p rend="center">II.</p>
                    <p>It is in the Western interest to support the autonomy of the Eastern European nations
            and not to curtail their maneuverability. However, it would be grotesque if certain
            centrifugal tendencies in the Communist world were to evoke an erosion of Western
            cooperation—in other words, if—to paraphrase a statement of Bismarck—a new “nightmare of
            bilateral or even multilateral constellations” should develop in Europe between decaying
            power and interest blocs.</p>
                    <p>Obviously it cannot be in the Western interest to permit illusions concerning the
            nature of the Eastern European regimes. On the other hand, it would be foolish to set
            ideological conditions as a price for communication.</p>
                    <p>Western policy will have to concentrate on measures in the economic and cultural realm.
            It will have to treat any Eastern European state as a full partner, but it will also
            have to take into account the military and ideological ties maintained by such
            states.</p>
                    <p>Over and above concrete forms of economic and cultural cooperation (which of necessity
            will have to remain limited, for the time being), it is of decisive importance to work
            toward good-neighborly relations. In this fashion evolutionary forces can be encouraged
            and furthered.</p>
                    <p>National consciousness in the Eastern European states, and their striving for greater
            autonomy find expression in growing self-interest. This tendency must be taken into
            account and should not be curbed by unnecessary generalizations or inappropriate
            over-all propositions.</p>
                    <p>Differentiation in development makes it necessary to evolve a different policy for each
            of the Eastern European countries. This aggravates further the known difficulties which
            beset efforts to achieve a coordinated Western position. However, it remains most
            desirable that the Western countries should agree to certain joint principles in their
            position vis-à-vis Eastern Europe, and that they should strengthen and systematize their
            exchange of information and experience. This should be done as effectively as possible
            and in a not particularly spectacular manner within the framework of existing European
            and Atlantic institutions.</p>
                    <p>The Common Market has had a liberalizing effect on economic thinking in all Eastern
            Europe. Modest but purposeful progress on the road to greater European unity and
            Atlantic partnership—as proposed by the Monnet Committee—would strengthen this
            tendency.</p>
                    <p>The regulations governing relations with third countries create a particular problem
            for the countries of the Common Market. A clarification <pb n="155" xml:id="pg_155" facs="0185"/>of the political intentions of the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>
            member-states is a prerequisite for closer relations with the Eastern European
            countries.</p>
                    <p>A formal relationship with the Common Market is dependent also on the capabilities of
            the Eastern European states and, not least, upon the “cohesion” of the Soviet-led
            bloc.</p>
                    <p>The West must demonstrate that it is working towards a framework of commercial policy
            in which also the national economies of the Eastern European peoples will be able to
            find a place. There are important reasons for allowing the countries of Eastern Europe
            to share in the liberalization resulting from the <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> Round. Objectionable political influences from the East would, of
            course, have to be avoided.</p>
                    <p>Economic facts of life in the Communist realm, and conditions in the West make it
            difficult at present materially to increase East-West trade. In order to achieve a
            substantial increase, the West will have to be prepared to grant far-reaching economic
            and financial supports, and the East will have to be ready to undertake far-reaching
            liberalization measures. The time is not ripe for either condition.</p>
                    <p>It might be useful to refer to the studies undertaken by the <gloss target="#t_ECE1">ECE</gloss> in Geneva concerning questions of expanding East-West trade. This applies
            also to considerations concerning the question of introducing a multilateral payments
            and accounting system among the members of the <gloss target="#t_ECE1">ECE</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>With respect to efforts to develop bilateral trade relations, however, it remains true,
            even under changed conditions, that the West is at a disadvantage vis-à-vis countries
            with a government monopoly on trade, when on the Western side there is unbridled
            competition among states and business firms.</p>
                    <p>It must be made clear over and over that the West is prepared, through practical
            cooperation, to promote economic progress and raise the standard of living for its own
            and for other peoples. This does not contradict the fact that the West must undertake no
            move which might jeopardize its security, and that it cannot consider unacceptable
            conditions. At present it no longer appears possible to find a unified solution for the
            problem of longterm credits. However, this remains an important problem.</p>
                    <p>Trade with the Eastern European states is not an end in itself. It must be evaluated
            and reviewed on a continuing basis within the over-all framework of Western policy.
            Wherever possible, economic agreements should be coupled with cultural agreements (“the
            more information, the more intellectual communication”) and—whenever it appears
            indicated—with humanitarian arrangements.</p>

                    <p>The study and development of joint, major technical projects is of great psychological
            importance and, in the long run, also of concrete significance. In this field the
            self-interest of the Eastern European countries will have to be the starting point.</p>
                    <p>In the first instance, consideration should be given to endeavors within the framework
            of an all-European power-economy, as, for example, the merger of supply lines (oil,
            electric power). These endeavors might lead to a delivery union (Lieferungsverband
            vielfaeltiger Form) and promote an awareness of European unity and over-all
            responsibility in line with the principle of balanced, mutual advantage. As regards the
            trends to be observed in this process, preliminary studies in various fields by the
              <gloss target="#t_ECE1">ECE</gloss> would be useful.</p>

            all Eastern European states subscribed, might serve as an example in the field of
            transport. At issue here are convincing possibilities for joint planning, with a view to
            future all-European transport needs which the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>
            commission also emphasized in a paper of April 10, 1961: “Particularly in the field of
            transport, it will not be possible to solve certain questions exclusively within the
            framework of the Six.” The European Conference of Transport Ministers, of which
            Yugoslavia is already a member, would probably be an appropriate body for long-range
            planning.</p>
                    <p>This is true also for the planning, construction, and improvement of waterways
            (Rhine-Main-Danube canal, Elbe traffic, Danube-Oder canal, and other connecting links).
            In this context, the Federal Republic of Germany will have to study whether or how it
            might participate in the settlement of questions concerning Danube shipping.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_ECE1">ECE</gloss> investigations concerning European specific
            questions, such as gas problems and water supply, water and air pollution should be
            utilized. The establishment of new, and the improvement of existing, connections in the
            civil aviation network are of increasing importance. (“What is possible between the U.S.
            and the U.S.S.R. should be possible also between Western and Eastern Europe.”)</p>

                    <p>Cultural agreements should be based on the principle of reciprocity. Under the special
            conditions obtaining in Germany, participation by responsible non-governmental agencies
            should also be considered. Films, particularly television films, are of special
            importance. Artistically valuable films from Poland and Czechoslovakia already have
            proven to be an <pb n="157" xml:id="pg_157" facs="0187"/>important contribution to
            better understanding, where Germany is concerned. In general, cultural agreements should
            include as many old as well as new media as possible.</p>
                    <p>The area of scientific exchange and cooperation could open up a wide field of bilateral
            and multilateral endeavors. Here one might argue persuasively: “If the Americans and the
            Russians can work together, why not the Europeans also?”</p>
                    <p>If full reciprocity cannot be achieved, it is in the interest of the West in some areas
            also to make use of limited liberalization. For instance, it is desirable that the
            Eastern European countries should open their borders to visitors from the West, even if
            these countries are not prepared to permit movement in the opposite direction.</p>
                    <p>Here, however, it is important that the Western perspective become clear and is not
            blurred. This means: As much cultural exchange as possible in both directions. This
            means further: We should do whatever lies in our power to open our borders also to the
            youth of the Eastern European states.</p>
                    <p>Over and above the useful activity of travel bureaus, consideration could be given to
            promoting low-cost tourism with the cooperation of the pertinent institutions and
            organizations, and with self-admini- stration for the exchange groups. This should not
            apply, however, to government-controlled propaganda trips. Furthermore, the agencies
            responsible for public health might consider an agreement concerning the mutual use of
            their facilities in spas and resort towns.</p>
                    <p>A “European youth organization,” as proposed by the German Social Democrats would have
            to include, in whatever form, a youth exchange with Eastern European countries.
            Reference is made further to the proposal of German youth organizations to prepare a
            general youth festival. Special agencies of the United Nations (<gloss target="#t_UNESCO1">UNESCO</gloss> ?) might assume sponsorship or lend assistance.</p>
                    <p>The present study is not designed to present detailed proposals for economic,
            technical, scientific, and cultural cooperation. That will have to be the task of
            experts. Their work will have to be based in part on carefully developed knowledge of
            the wishes and concepts of the various Eastern European states.</p>
                    <p rend="center">VI.</p>
                    <p>Within this framework the position and treatment of the Soviet Zone of Germany—the
            so-called <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>—constitutes a special problem.</p>
                    <p>It is a problem, in part, because Western policy in the German question
            (self-determination, non-recognition, safeguarding of the peace) must not be affected
            and jeopardized in this context. Secondly, the problem arises because the <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> regime reacts, or, rather, must react, to
            developments in the Communist world in a manner which is diametrically <pb n="158" xml:id="pg_158" facs="0188"/>opposed to the behavior of the Eastern European
            governments: Not more autonomy in relation to the Soviet Union, but rather additional
            evidence of “reliability.”</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, a German policy designed to wrest from the <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> regime alleviations for the human beings affected by the
            division, and for the population in the Zone, is in keeping with the interests of the
            West. The Interzonal Trade between the two parts of Germany, based on Allied orders,
            must be viewed also in this context, in addition to its significance for Berlin
            access.</p>
                    <p>The possibilities for economic and cultural communication with the Soviet Zone are
            primarily a German problem, but the need for consultation and agreement with the three
            Powers is self-evident.</p>
                    <p>All in all, it may be assumed that more intensive communication between the Western and
            Eastern European peoples cannot and will not bypass the Zone. Already in preparing for
            this objective, we should consider how, for example, Soviet Zone youth might be brought
            into general youth events.</p>
                    <p>In multilateral economic endeavors it is not necessary to forego a priori the
            possibility of including the Zone, in third place, for instance. The equal status
            desired by the Zone regime could be avoided by the (West) German side by making the
            Federal German contribution through private business firms or business associations.</p>
                    <p rend="center">VII.</p>
                    <p>A flexible policy designed to achieve a high degree of communication with Eastern
            Europe requires appropriate preparation of the Western peoples. It must be made clear
            that such a policy is neither weak nor illusory, but that it proceeds from changing
            realities and is designed to bring about a better future—the objectives which President
              <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> sketched out in his speech of July 4,
            1962. The conviction must be reaffirmed that the free society possesses greater vigor
            and vitality. Furthermore, there can be no doubting the fact that the free peoples
            cannot find salvation in bilateralism but, rather, in a meaningful, integrated and
            organized community.</p>
                    <p>On the basis of the so-called Jaksch Report, the German Bundestag resolved unanimously
            on June 14, 1961 “to make use of every opportunity to achieve a normalization of
            relations between the Federal Republic and the Eastern European states, without
            sacrificing vital German interests.”</p>
                    <p>In his Government Declaration of October 28, 1963,<note n="14" xml:id="d67fn14">October
              18. The portions dealing with foreign policy are in Meissner, <hi rend="italic">Die
                deutsche Ostpolitik</hi>, pp. 63–66.</note> Professor Erhard observed: “Within the
            limits of its ability, the Federal Government is <pb n="159" xml:id="pg_159" facs="0189"/>prepared to expand the economic exchange with these countries. In the same manner it
            welcomes increased cultural contacts.” In his New York speech of May 15, 1964,<note n="15" xml:id="d67fn15">See <ref target="#d40fn7">footnote 7, Document
              40</ref>.</note>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Willy Brandt</persName> urged: “Our wish to work together
            must be made visible also to the Eastern European peoples. It is time to recognize more
            clearly that Europe does not end at the Iron Curtain.” In the same speech Brandt said:
            “We should propose joint projects to the peoples of Eastern Europe and make them
            understand that we do not fear but that, on the contrary, we desire a rise in their
            living standard to a level comparable to ours. This accords also with the original idea
            of the Marshall Plan.”</p>
                    <p>The Americans in particular have made clear the connection between European
            developments and the German question. In Berlin, <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> spoke about “the course leading to the re-unification of Germany
            and the restoration of Europe,” which would not be an easy one. Johnson said in his
            Lexington speech: “It is our belief that the wise and skillful development of relations
            with the nations of Eastern Europe can bring closer the day on which Germany will be
            reunified.”</p>
                    <p>It is in the joint interest of the West to guard against the stabilization of
            conditions which, by promoting the recognition of more than one state in Germany, would
            prejudice efforts to achieve an all-German peace treaty. This accounts in part also for
            the problems inherent in developing German trade missions in the Eastern European
            countries.</p>
                    <p>In the present interim phase we must insist, above all, that the ties between Berlin
            and the Federal Republic are respected. The differences which have become manifest in
            this area (between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, and in the intermediate positions
            taken by the Eastern European governments) are of significance.</p>
                    <p>From the German point of view it is most important that agreements concerning economic
            and technical matters should be accompanied by an amelioration of human distress. It is
            obvious that on the German side, concern about the fate of German nationals and ethnic
            groups in Eastern Europe must play a special role. The question of family reunion also
            plays a significant role for emigrants and expellees of other nationalities.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, the main issues at present appear to be:</p>
                    <p>1. In awareness of existing differences of opinion, to bring about a consensus of
            Western views on these questions, in order to find a basis for joint policy;</p>
                    <p>2. To inform the governments and peoples of the Eastern European countries about the
            prerequisites and possibilities for fruitful cooperation;</p>
                    <p>3. To convince public opinion in our countries that even minor progress can help to
            influence in a positive sense structural change in an important field of world politics
            and to advance, in the long run, the restoration of Europe.</p>

                    <p>870. Personal for the Secretary. Of all of the potential points of friction or armed
            conflict between ourselves and the Soviets in connection with Berlin, the one that has
            concerned me most in recent months has been that of our helicopter flights over East
            Berlin. I was, accordingly, particularly interested in the telegram which the Dept sent
            to General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> on the subject on August 29
            giving approval for continuation of such flights (rptd to Bonn as <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 609)<note n="2" xml:id="d68fn2">Dated August 29.
              (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 38–9)</note> Because I consider this
            matter one of great sensitivity, and particularly since I do not know the extent of your
            recent personal involvement in this problem, I am taking the liberty of raising it with
            you directly.</p>
                    <p>You are aware of the general background of these flights. They were made only
            infrequently before erection of the Wall, but since then have been regularly programmed
            at four to six-week intervals. The Soviets have been objecting to the flights for some
            time, and they are now slowly escalating their threats. They have long referred to the
            helicopters as “air space violators.” On June 24, the Soviets implied that the flight
            might turn into something like “the incidents of January and March”.<note n="3" xml:id="d68fn3">Reference is to the two aircraft shot down by Soviet fighters over
              East Germany; see <ref target="#d8">Documents 8</ref>, <ref target="#d19">19</ref>,
                <ref target="#d20">20</ref>, and <ref target="#d21">21</ref>.</note> On August 3,
            the Soviet <gloss target="#t_BASC1">BASC</gloss> controller said that “alert fighters
            will take the necessary measures.” There is no evidence that fighters were in fact
            lofted on this occasion, but we now have certain indications (concerning which I am
            asking <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> to brief you),<note n="4" xml:id="d68fn4">No
              record of the briefing was found.</note> that actual countermeasures might be taken
            against the next flight, possibly up to an attempt to shoot the helicopter down.</p>
                    <p>After looking into this matter very carefully, I have concluded that our justifications
            for continuing these flights, in order of priority, are (1) the old Berlin maxim that
            you never give up a right which you have successfully exercised; and (2) that through
            air photography from the helicopter, we are able to ascertain information about
            potential jamming devices which could threaten our utilization of our navigational
            aids.</p>
                    <p>It is obviously important to maintain the right of unhindered flight within the Berlin
            Control Zone under 10,000 feet. We have interpreted the right to include helicopter
            flights over East Berlin, and having established this interpretation through practice, I
            would agree with the Dept <pb n="161" xml:id="pg_161" facs="0191"/>that we should
            continue the flights. I believe, however, that we should not equate the principle of
            maintaining unhindered utilization of the Berlin Control Zone with the maintenance of a
            particular frequency or pattern of helicopter flights.</p>
                    <p>I have been briefed on the intelligence justification for the helicopter flights, but
            am not fully convinced that the information could not be obtained by more conventional
            methods, i.e. by photography from normal aircraft. At any rate, due to the relatively
            static situation re Soviet installations, I do not think that the helicopter flights are
            required for this purpose as frequently as they now occur. The interval, in my judgment,
            could be increased to several months.</p>
                    <p>General Polk, the Commandant in Berlin who has just been relieved, is strongly in favor
            of a continuation of these flights at their present schedule, as are presumably other
            high military officials here who would be concerned, i.e. General Freeman, <gloss target="#t_USAREUR1">USAREUR</gloss>, and General Disosway, <gloss target="#t_USAFE1">USAFE</gloss>. They can be expected to oppose any change in the present schedule.
            Indeed, the message to which I referred (<gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 609)
            indicates that the Dept itself, after a recent interchange on this subject, has decided
            against any change.</p>
                    <p>Although I am not often more cautious in Berlin matters than the <gloss target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss>, I question whether the advantage to be achieved,
            during the period intervening before the American elections on November 3, is worth the
            risk of being openly challenged by the Soviets with the possibility of their shooting
            down our helicopter. The shooting down of a US helicopter would inevitably result in a
            most serious confrontation between ourselves and the Soviets, with the possibility of
            further escalation. Since this would result from quite a different situation from that
            which occurred when our T–39 and RB–66 aircraft were off course and technically in the
            wrong we would be committed by prestige and principle to react strongly.</p>
                    <p>The Commandant in Berlin is expected to recommend a regular flight within the next few
            days. According to my instructions, he must first submit his plan to me for approval as
            to suitability of the timing in terms of the broader German and world situation. Any
            decision for an extended delay, however, in light of the <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> and Departmental interest should, I believe, be made in Washington.</p>
                    <p>In the circumstances, I recommend that the next flight be deferred until mid-winter.
            This will not give up the right, nor for that matter will it dispose of the problem,
            since the Soviets could shoot the aircraft down as easily then as now. Postponement
            would, however, preclude disturbance during a delicate period in our country, and could
            presumably be done without any serious derogation of our intelligence interests.</p>
                    <p>I believe this matter is of sufficient importance that you may wish to discuss it with
            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, and possibly even the
            President. <pb n="162" xml:id="pg_162" facs="0192"/>Until hearing from you, I will in
            any event delay approval of any further flights.</p>

            agreement will be signed. In addition to the signing ceremonies, there will be a series
            of public statements—by the West Berlin Senat, the Government of the Federal Republic,
            the Allied Commandants, as well as an <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>-Brandt exchange announcing support for the agreement, and defining

            political significance.</p>
                    <p>The agreement will make it possible for West Berliners to visit relatives in East

            not only with the Communist East Germans, but also with the Christian Democratic
            government of the Federal Republic. At times the dialogue with the Federal Government
            was more difficult than with the Communists. In fact, the Federal Government only
            yielded at the very end to avoid bearing the onus for collapsed negotiations.</p>

                    <p>This morning, after much soul-searching, the Federal Cabinet found enough in the
            agreement to justify endorsing it. With that step, the way was open for signing
            ceremonies tomorrow and first visits in mid-October.</p>
                    <p>On balance, the West will gain more from this agreement than the Communists. The
            Communists will get themselves a safety valve to lessen tensions in East Germany; the
            West will be able to reestablish relations with the isolated East German population and
            build bridges to it.</p>

              5)</note> the British, French, and we agree that this action is likely to be only the
            first in a series of attempts to modify certain aspects of the existing relationship
            between the <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> and Berlin. <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> representatives have on occasion frankly stated
            that during the present period when significant progress toward reunification is not
            possible, the best that can be done is to strengthen further the ties between Berlin and
            Bonn. This one way, in German eyes, to prevent solidification of the status quo and to
            counter Soviet and East German contentions that West Berlin is a third German political
            entity alongside the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>In an electoral year, steps toward a closer integration of Berlin in the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> will be good politics for the govt. It will help to steal
            some of the thunder which opposition leader <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Willy
              Brandt</persName> can still command as Governing Mayor of Berlin, and at the same time
            move in a direction consistent with the German theory that Berlin is legally a part of
            the <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss>, <pb n="164" xml:id="pg_164" facs="0194"/>subject only to certain reservations imposed by the Western Occupying Powers.</p>
                    <p>It was perhaps inevitable, once Soviet pressures on Berlin had relaxed, that the
            Germans would attempt to resume the process of creeping amalgamation of the Western
            sectors with the <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> which had characterized the
            years between 1950 and 1958. During this period, the US generally advocated a permissive
            policy on the part of the Occupying Powers and was prepared to accept virtual de facto
            absorption of Berlin within the Bonn system.</p>
                    <p>We have learned since, through our experience during the crisis years 1958–63, that the
            consistently formalistic and restrictive French approach, while extreme, had certain
            advantages. Apart from preserving the purity of our legal position vis-à-vis the
            Soviets, it tended to maintain a system of Western occupation control which could
            provide the operative basis for the kind of modus vivendi on Berlin which seems to have
            emerged after nearly five years of intense diplomatic crisis and struggle over the
            future of the city.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss> will recall that our differences with the
              <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> over the status of Berlin last came to a
            head in the autumn of 1961, during Ambassadorial Group discussions following the
            submission of a German memorandum on the subject (reproduced as <gloss target="#t_BQD1">BQD</gloss> 53).<note n="3" xml:id="d70fn3">Not found.</note> It became clear at the
            time that the opposing views could not be reconciled on the level of logical argument
            and that both sides could agree to disagree. It was felt better to let the issue remain
            dormant, since the <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> was not then pressing for
            any specific actions which challenged the Allied view. It has proved feasible to operate
            quite successfully on the basis of this tacit agreement to disagree. We doubt if the
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> would wish at this point to push so far as to
            destroy this modus vivendi. The German objective is to achieve the maximum show of unity
            with Berlin without destroying the position of the Allies in Berlin—particularly of the
            US—on which they know the security of the city depends. The Allied requirements, on the
            other hand, would seem to depend on legal substance and power rather than show. Our
            primary interest is to prevent jeopardy to our de jure position or doubts as to our
            intention to remain in, and defend, Berlin.</p>
                    <p>It is within the context of these differing but not necessarily incompatible German and
            Allied objectives that we believe the three Occupying Powers should examine with some
            care the various courses of action open to the FedGovt and prepare considered responses
            so that they will not be caught by surprise when specific proposals are made.</p>
                    <p>There are broadly two categories of action which the <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> could propose:</p>
                    <pb n="165" xml:id="pg_165" facs="0195"/>
                    <p>1. Further demonstrative gestures such as Cabinet meetings, which have no basic effect
            on the legal position of Berlin but which highlight the activities of the FedGovt in the
            city. A proposal for the resumption of Bundestag meetings in Berlin would fall in this
            category.</p>
                    <p>2. Changes which could be interpreted as affecting the legal structure of relationships
            between the <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> and Berlin. In this category would
            fall proposals for the direct election of Bundestag members from Berlin, giving free
            voting rights to Berlin members of the Bundestag, or the substitution of a Globalgesetz
            procedure for the existing Mantelgesetz procedure for the adoption of Federal
            legislation in Berlin.</p>
                    <p>At this point, we are inclined to think that we could swallow occasional Bundestag
            meetings in Berlin. We would have greater difficulty in accepting proposals requiring
            formal changes in the existing structure of law. In the latter category, we could
            perhaps most easily permit direct election of Bundestag members from Berlin who would
            continue without voting rights in the Bundestag. In any event we believe we should think
            our way carefully to a final position, and would as a start appreciate receiving
            Berlin's comments.<note n="4" xml:id="d70fn4">Not found.</note>

                    </p>
                    <p>1. In Moscow's 980 to the Dept Amb <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> has
            raised important questions concerning relations between Moscow, Bonn and Washington as
            they revolve around Berlin and the German question. In Embtel 1340,<note n="3" xml:id="d71fn3">
                            <ref target="#d70">Document 70</ref>.</note>
                        <pb n="166" xml:id="pg_166" facs="0196"/>which pouched to Moscow unfortunately crossed
            Moscow's reftel, we also alluded to the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>'s policy
            with regard to Berlin. Although we raise virtually the same issue as Amb <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName>, our tentative conclusions are somewhat different.
            We will therefore, in the present message, comment further in order to respond to Amb
              <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> and to cover the problem in fuller
            scope.</p>
                    <p>2. Neither the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> nor any one of the three major
            political parties in West Germany regards acceptance or solidification of the present
            status quo in Central Europe as desirable. They do not, however, wish to bring about a
            change by force, indeed, they are so committed. We have, for example, seen in time of
            crisis in Berlin that they are prepared to move in the direction of accepting the status
            quo if under serious pressure from the Soviets. When, however, this pressure is no
            longer present or the Soviet threat less credible—a condition which they now consider to
            exist and estimate as likely to prevail for at least several years—the Germans revert to
            their underlying desire for progress on the German question. As noted in Embtel 1340, it
            is this desire which motivates the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> in seeking a
            greater show of unity with Berlin through Cabinet meetings and the like.</p>
                    <p>3. It is significant that the steps which the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> has
            taken or contemplates taking are not new. The recent Bundesversammlung meeting in Berlin
            should in fairness be accepted entirely as indicative of a trend, since it has never met
            anyplace except Berlin and its timing is determined by the Constitution. Certain other
            possible steps, moreover, e.g. Bundestag meetings, automatic application of Federal
            legislation, direct election of Bundestag representatives, were either in practice or
            had been sought before the Berlin crisis began in 1958. The Allies, under certain
            conditions, had actually approved the enactment of a “Globalgesetz” providing for the
            general application of Federal legislation. What we are now witnessing is, in our
            judgment, merely a resurfacing on the German side of a strong current temporarily forced
            underground by the prolonged Berlin crisis.</p>
                    <p>4. We believe that the desire for progress toward reunification will be a continuing
            and basic motivation of German foreign policy regardless of which party is in power.
            This is another way of saying that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> will not
            under foreseeable circumstances be prepared to cooperate in accepting or solidifying the
            status quo in Berlin or East Germany. Whether the United States or all three of the
            Western Occupying Powers are satisfied with the present state of affairs is therefore in
            the long run not likely to be the determining factor. We will, of course, continue to
            seek specifically U.S. objectives, and for various reasons we shall not always be able
            to support the Germans. But we must recognize that, given the overall position of the
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> in the Western Alliance, there are very definite
            practical <pb n="167" xml:id="pg_167" facs="0197"/>limits to the possibility of our
            forcing or persuading the Germans to accept a policy which is repugnant to them.</p>
                    <p>5. A factor which we need always to keep in mind is the complexity and delicacy of the
            problem which the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> faces in seeking to bring East and
            West Germans closer together in the interest of preserving the concept of their
            nationhood. There have been a whole series of examples recently: the pass agreement, the
            Hof Bridge settlement, rail path negotiations, etc. In each case the East German
            objective quite clearly has been to achieve either increased recognition or at least a
            public indication that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> is prepared to come to
            terms with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> as a lasting if unattractive reality.
            The West Germans must in each case decide to what extent they should accept East German
            terms in pursuing precisely the contrary objective of bringing German reunification
            closer. While recognizing that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> has frequently
            been inept in dealing with the East Germans, we should nevertheless not forget the
            difficulty of the problem they face. No one at the present time can be absolutely sure
            whether the pass agreement, for example, is a step more toward reunification or toward
            recognition of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. Given this situation, it would
            hardly be surprising if the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> should seek some extra
            insurance on at least part of its position by forward steps in its relations with West
            Berlin, where it is dealing with friends rather than foes.</p>
                    <p>6. The Germans are looking for such insurance elsewhere as well. The Berlin clause is a
            major attraction of the trade agreements with Eastern European countries and which the
              <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> may eventually seek with Communist China. The
            Chancellor will certainly seek some recognition of the special ties between Berlin and
            the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> during <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>'s visit. This is the most they hope for, and I have found no
            real optimism among those who determine German policy on the prospects of achieving even
            this limited aim. State Secretary Carstens has told me that he does not expect a Soviet
            concession on the Berlin clause question.</p>
                    <p>7. Contrary to the impression conveyed by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GH3">Groepper</persName> in Moscow, <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> has
            consistently cautioned in both public and private statements against any great
            expectations from the talks with <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>.
            There is, it is true, among the business community and some politicians a tendency to
            think that it will be a salutary and revealing experience for <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> to see at first hand the economic strength and
            political stability of the <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss>. To this extent
            there is perhaps wishful thinking in the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. But even
            among these circles we have seen no recent signs of a belief that reunification can be
            bought through economic concessions. I am convinced that those Germans who will be
            planning the <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> visit—Schroeder,
              <persName corresp="#p_WL5">Westrick</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_KF3">Krapf</persName>—have no
            illusions about a changed Soviet attitude on the German question as a result of the
              <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> visit. The <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> is closely following statements emanating from
            Moscow such as the Pravda editorial cited in the reftel. <pb n="168" xml:id="pg_168" facs="0198"/>The Chief of the <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> Soviet section
              (<persName corresp="#p_KE6">Kutscher</persName>) quoted to us the Suslov <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> anniversary speech as an indication of how little could
            be expected from <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>'s journey to Bonn.
            The Schwirkmann case has also hardly contributed to an optimistic atmosphere in the
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>8. With specific relation to Berlin, although I have not always found the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>'s timing or method of presentation of proposed actions as
            adroit as it could be, I believe we would encounter serious problems if we failed to
            understand the strong current of German thinking which their Berlin policy represents.
            Equally serious problems would of course be encountered on the side of the Allies if the
            Germans should ever come to underestimate the importance of maintaining the Allied
            position in Berlin inviolable. I am optimistic that the present satisfactory
            understanding on this question can be maintained, however it may require some
            re-thinking—and some yielding on less important issues—on the part of the Allies. It was
            the objective of Embtel 1340 to analyze where it might be possible for the Allies to
            “give.” We may have to restrain the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> at times, but we
            cannot on the other hand allow the Soviets or the East Germans the right of defining
            what is or is not provocative. It is often the East Germans or the Soviets themselves
            (as in their military parade in East Berlin on the 15th anniversary of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>) who commit the most flagrant provocations.</p>
                    <p>9. I would like particularly to emphasize that if we give the impression of pushing the
            Germans to accept the status quo in Germany—whether this be related to Berlin or to
            broader aspects of the question, we shall be in for trouble. The Germans do not have any
            real hope at the present of achieving a satisfactory solution of the German problem
            within the foreseeable future. They do, however, hope and expect that their Western
            Allies, particularly the United States, will stand with them in keeping the issue alive
            and probing for modest progress, even though the effort may be futile. In some respects,
            and this involves both the personal practice of FonMin Schroeder and the general posture
            of the <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> govt, the appearance of effort
            may be more important than the substance of real progress. But the appearance of effort
            there must be, especially in an election year, if the govt is to preserve the allegiance
            of its supporters. For this reason, we could not expect that they could accept the
              Soviet-<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Assistance
            of June 12, 1964 without a strong reaction.</p>
                    <p>10. I have not detected any significant “Rapallo” thinking in the Fed-Rep. This
            includes the Ruhr industrialists with whom I maintain fairly close contact. The
            alternative to the Atlantic partnership usually cited by those in Germany who are
            looking for an alternative is not an arrangement with Moscow but closer cooperation with
            France. Any suspicion that the US is not prepared to support German reunification
            encourages, illogical though it seems, Gaullist thinking in the <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss>. In the future <pb n="169" xml:id="pg_169" facs="0199"/>this could transform itself into a nationalist approach conducive to
            Rapallo thinking. This is only likely to arise, however, if we fail to take fully into
            account the depth of German feeling against acceptance or solidification of the status
            quo.</p>

                    <p>1950. Secretary and Under Secretary. During the past week a number of reports of former
            Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>'s current views have come to
            our attention, each confirming that he has moved towards virtually complete acceptance
            of the <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> position, combined with an
            anti-American bias and a suspicion of US motives which lead him almost automatically to
            oppose what he conceives to be the position of the US. The report to this effect
            contained in Embtel 1924,<note n="2" xml:id="d72fn2">Telegram 1924 from Bonn, November
              17, reported on <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Henry Kissinger</persName>'s meeting with
                <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 3 <gloss target="#t_EUR1">EUR</gloss> W)</note> based on a conversation
            between <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Henry Kissinger</persName>, while stark, is probably reasonably accurate.</p>
                    <p>In a conversation with FonMin Schroeder yesterday at luncheon, he commented on how
            difficult <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> was making life for him by his
            repeated attacks. There was now a complete lack of rapport between himself and <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>. He could no longer talk with <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> about serious subjects. It may be of interest
            that Schroeder confided that he had not intended to attack <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> recently, as it appeared in the article he had given to a Mainz
            journalist just prior to Adenauer's visit to Paris. The journalist had not only released
            the article prematurely, before rather than after Adenauer's visit, but attributed
            background comment on <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> directly to the
              <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>, contrary to their understanding. The <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> felt, however, that on balance he had gained more
            through acquiring the reputation of a fighter, than he had lost through the mishap.</p>

                    <p>Former High Commissioner <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName>, who has been
            here as head of the American delegation to the fourth German-American conference,
            reports that, while he was in Berlin, Von Eckhardt (for many years the former
            Chancellor's chief information officer and now Federal plenipotentiary to Berlin) stated
            that <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> was hopelessly anti-American. He had
            been this way since his first visit to the United States during the <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> administration. He had developed a distrust for
            President <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> and certain of his advisers.
            According to Von Eckhardt, <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> felt that he
            had not been treated with proper respect during his visit. It was shortly after his
            visit to the US, while he was still under the influence of his disenchantment with the
            United States, that he had made his famous visit to France<note n="3" xml:id="d72fn3">
                            <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> visited France December 9, 1961. See
                <ref target="frus1961-63v14">

              for <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>'s report to <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> on the meeting.</note> and had been taken in
            completely by President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> was further alienated by President <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName>'s policy of seeking limited agreements with the
            Soviets, which he strongly opposed.</p>
                    <p>In the meeting which he had with <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> later
            in Bonn, <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> reports that <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> labeled Schroeder a dunce (Dummkopf) and then
            went on to apply the same epithet to all Germans. He told <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> that Americans simply didn't understand <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> or what was happening in Europe. The great danger, which the US
            did not comprehend, was that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> might be
            forced to go to the Soviets. He referred admiringly to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName>'s library, giving the impression that his respect for <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> derives from the fact that he represents the
            best in French culture and civilization, to which Americans presumably do not measure
            up. He expressed doubt that the US was capable of world leadership. <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> further felt, he stressed to <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName>, that the US would not defend Germany in a pinch.
            The recent <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Fallex exercise had convinced him that
            we would not use nuclear weapons against the Soviets until it was too late.</p>
                    <p>During a luncheon conversation yesterday with <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> and the <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss>, Minister for Special
            Tasks Krone expressed somewhat similar suspicions of US nuclear policy. (He had
            personally participated in the Fallex exercise, and is probably the source of <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>'s information on this subject.) Krone protested
            the suggestion that the Chancellor and those who agreed with him were anti-American or
            that their pro-French policies were the main threat to the preservation of valuable
            postwar institutions. Krone did say that, if he were forced to make a choice, and he
            hoped it would never come to that, he would have to choose the US in preference to
            France.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: Our policy here has been to keep in contact with
              <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>. I have had him to lunch privately at
            the Residence every three or four <pb n="171" xml:id="pg_171" facs="0201"/>months, on
            which occasions he is relatively congenial and responsive. He attended our last Fourth
            of July reception. However, we are somewhat at a loss to know how to go about changing
            his attitude toward the US. He has apparently reconstructed in his own mind the entire
            course of postwar history to justify his own policies and those of President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> as against those of the United States. He still
            professes his basic friendship for the US, as he did to a group of US participants in
            the German-American conference yesterday. He probably thinks he is being sincere in
            this, although in practice his friendship amounts to little more than an empty formula.
            On any given point of conflict he will always end up defending the French position.</p>
                    <p>At this stage of his life <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> seems to be
            most affected by his strong positive or negative reactions to personalities, as well as
            by the quality of flattery he receives and by the cultural level of the environment
            which is provided him. We obviously cannot seem to reward him on this point, especially
            just after he has received the French honors of the Academy. One possibility which I
            should like to think about and comment on further is that he be invited to give a series
            of lectures at a leading American university, perhaps Harvard, from which he received an
            honorary degree. This might provide the kind of environment that would favorably impress
            him—and an opportunity for organized flattery and blandishments.</p>
                    <p>Without wishing to exaggerate <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>'s
            influence, he is nevertheless a serious problem for us. When the controversies he stirs
            up are brought out into the open, either in the Fraktion or before the public, he often
            has to backtrack. All the same, he can still get a group of some 60 or so Deputies in
            the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> to follow him on most issues. He is fortified by
            public opinion polls which show him as “the best Chancellor Germany has had,” and will
            continue to have a disruptive effect on the efforts of the <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> government to move ahead on policies which we favor.<note n="4" xml:id="d72fn4">In telegram 1964 from Bonn, November 18, <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> suggested again that <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> be invited to lecture at Harvard University as a means of
              dealing with his anti-American bias, adding, “The effort may be basically hopeless …
              but it might still be worth a try. His capacity to do damage to our interests here is
              still considerable.” (Department of State, Central Files, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 7 <gloss target="#t_GER1">GER</gloss> W)</note>

            about a quadripartite meeting in Paris before the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
              meeting.<note n="3" xml:id="d73fn3">See <ref target="frus1964-68v13#d43">

              43</ref>.</note> The Secretary said that he had suggested that such a meeting would be
            useful in order to exchange views about the Soviet Union. A meeting of the four Foreign
            Ministers might be preceded by a meeting of the experts.</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister Schroeder said he thought this a very good idea. A preliminary meeting
            on December 12 would be very useful. However, in the view of the Federal Republic, an
            effective presentation of the need for German reunification depends on the United
            States. The US is the only power which can really accomplish anything with the Soviet
            Union. It is of the greatest significance, therefore, that the position of the US on the
            German unification question be kept constantly before the people.</p>
                    <pb n="173" xml:id="pg_173" facs="0203"/>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister said that it would be most useful if the President could mention
            this subject in his State of the Union speech. He noted that President <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> had discussed the need for German reunification
            in one of his first speeches and this had been useful. The Foreign Minister observed
            that he had no doubt about US policy but felt it important to restate it.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Schroeder commented that there are recurring rumors in Europe about negotiations
            between the US and the Soviet Union. One rumor has it that 140 letters have been
            exchanged. It is important to counter these rumors. The Foreign Minister said that he
            would comment on this subject in his talk to the National Press Club on November 24. He
            would make the point that US talks with the Soviet Union are an essential prerequisite
            for peace in central Europe. The Foreign Minister reiterated that the Soviets also have
            an interest in a solution of the German question, and therefore the Federal Republic is
            happy to see this subject taken up in official statements. It is important to prevent
            poisonous mistrust of US intentions from arising in Germany.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said that the matter of an
            initiative will doubtless come up at the quadripartite meeting. The Secretary said that
            he would like to make a distinction between substance and procedure. He commented that
            our problem was really more on procedure than substance. The Secretary said that the US
            would be reluctant to take the initiative, then look around and ask where is everybody.
            He commented that it had taken three years to reduce the Berlin crisis and that this had
            been done without any French participation.</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister Schroeder said that this matter had not been recently discussed with
            the French but that the French have always argued that the time has not yet come to
            approach the Soviets. The French say that it is up to the Soviets to reduce tension.
            Foreign Minister Schroeder agreed that it is important to have Four-Power unanimity and
            that this would impress the Soviets even if no agreement is worked out with them.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister referred to the proposal made some months ago in Moscow by then
              <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName>.<note n="4" xml:id="d73fn4">
                            <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName> visited the Soviet Union July 27–August
              1.</note> This proposal (for establishment of a Four-Power council) had met with a
            complete Soviet rejection. The Foreign Minister wondered, however, whether this proposal
            should not be pursued further.</p>
                    <p>He commented that the Berlin situation is calm now but that the problems remain—the
            Four-Power responsibilities, access, etc. Perhaps some procedural progress could be
            made. The Foreign Minister reiterated that the new Soviet regime has not been sounded
            out on this matter <pb n="174" xml:id="pg_174" facs="0204"/>and that the Soviets have an
            interest in a solution. The Foreign Minister said that he thought it would be useful to
            renew the <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName> proposal and that in any case
            this should be discussed in Paris.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister commented that a US clarification of its position on the German
            question has an important influence on the uncommitted powers, as well as on France and
            the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said that he was not so much
            concerned that the Soviets would say no to an Allied proposal, but rather that they
            might say maybe and then ask questions where there were no agreed answers. The Foreign
            Minister said that if a Four-Power approach should be made to the Soviets, there should
            be previous preparation, perhaps in the Ambassadorial Group. He thought that questions
            like this should be discussed at the forthcoming talks in Paris. The Foreign Minister
            stressed the desirability of sounding out the reaction of the new Soviet leaders on the
            German question and commented that it should not be necessary to have a complete program
            at the very start.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> suggested that other initiatives
            for separate stages of action might be considered. For example humanitarian commissions
            under Four-Power auspices might be considered.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister said that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> is prepared to
            return to these ideas. He commented that such ideas were well worth exploration.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> asked about <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>'s position in the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. Mr. Schroeder replied that there was a lot of talk about changes in the
              <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. He commented, however, that <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> is a “superprefect” who can adjust to every
            change that comes along. The Foreign Minister commented that <persName corresp="#p_SW6">Willi Stoph</persName> is a different type: he is a German
            Communist rather than an emigre Communist like <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>. It may be possible that future leaders of the Soviet Zone will
            feel more like Germans and less like Communists. The Foreign Minister also commented
            that East German youth do not appear to react favorably to all the pressure put on them
            by the Zone authorities, and that proximity of West Germany also has an effect in
            reducing the attractiveness of Communism.</p>
                    <p>In any discussions with the Soviets about reunification, Foreign Minister Schroeder
            thought it important to stress that the Soviets would not lose the economic benefits
            they now derive from the Soviet Zone. It should be made clear to the Soviets that the
            type of agreement the West has in mind would take into account the economic interest of
            the Soviet Union. Any Western program on the German question must be flexible. The
            Foreign Minister commented that there are independent trends developing in the West as
            in the East, and that similar factors are at work on both sides.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> stated the Soviet Government
            attached the greatest importance to a German peace settlement. Until that problem was
            resolved, the situation in Europe would be explosive and could not be characterized as
            normal. This matter had been discussed between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. on a number of
            earlier occasions, and on some points the positions of the two sides had become closer.
            It would be only logical to continue discussion of those points. The Soviet Union was
            prepared to continue discussing all the points which had been discussed earlier, with a
            view to arriving at a conclusion. The Secretary had mentioned that he wished to consult
            the allies.<note n="2" xml:id="d74fn2">The discussion took place on December 2 during a
              meeting at the Soviet Mission to the United Nations. A memorandum of conversation is
              in Department of State, Secretary's Memoranda of Conversation: Lot 65 D 330.</note>
            The Soviet Union recognized that this was only natural and in fact it also consulted its
            own allies. However, the Soviet Union believed that discussion could be continued now on
            the same basis as before.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that one of the crucial points
            was that of the presence of Western forces in West Berlin. In earlier discussions, the
            Secretary had raised the question of access, and the Soviet Union had stated its views
            on this matter. The discussion on that point had not been conclusive at that time, and
            the Soviet Union was prepared to continue it. If this matter were dealt with, both sides
            would put forward their considerations and perhaps there would be a greater chance for
            understanding. Of course, the questions discussed in earlier conversations were
            interrelated; they were those of Western forces and access, borders, non-aggression <pb n="176" xml:id="pg_176" facs="0206"/>pact, <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
            sovereignty, subversive activities in West Berlin, denuclearization of the two
            Germanys.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said there were two roads along which we could proceed. First, we could
            seek a final and historically satisfactory solution of the German problem, a solution
            linked to major steps in organizing European security and leading to a final conclusion
            of security arrangements by <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and Warsaw Pact
            countries. Such a solution would open vast prospects for disarmament in Europe and North
            America, for trade, etc. As far as we were concerned, we did not see how a final
            conclusion could be arrived at without the wishes of the people concerned being taken
            into account. Of course, we were talking about a vast number of people living in Europe
            and North America, and we did not believe that the choice of 70 million Germans should
            be an obstacle to the development of our relations. Next year would mark the 20th
            anniversary of the end of World War II, and perhaps that would be a good time for a bold
            and radical solution. On the other hand, perhaps the time for such a solution was not
            yet ripe and we should see what could be done for the ordinary people living in the
            immediate area. Some progress in this respect had already been made. There had been some
            improvement in the relations between the FRG and East Germany, and some steps had been
            taken to alleviate the humanitarian aspects of the situation. For example, the U.S. was
            happy about the pass arrangements which had been recently developed. Also, trade between
            West Germany and Eastern Europe, including East Germany, was increasing steadily and
            importantly. Perhaps some additional, important steps could be made to make the life of
            the people in the area more secure. However, the Secretary said, he wished to reiterate
            that he did not see—and this was not a cold war view—any permanent solution unless the
            German people had their full say in it. Unless these elementary considerations were
            taken into account, there would always be a chance for manipulation and for a demagogue
            calling for a course no one wanted to see the Germans take. The Secretary said he would
            see his colleagues in Paris and get in touch with the Soviet side thereafter. He wanted
            to ask Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> directly whether in his view
            there was a possibility of having a solution based on the judgment of the people living
            in West Germany and East Germany.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> responded that he did not think the
            term “judgment” was the right one in this context, although he knew what the Secretary
            meant. The fact was that there were two German States. The division between them was
            most profound and almost impossible to overcome. Thus, the only possibility of working
            for reunification was through disarming the two German States and through mutual
            understanding between them. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he
            wished to reiterate Soviet readiness to include in any understanding among the Great
            Powers a provision stating that the Great Powers would make efforts to facilitate
            reunification. <pb n="177" xml:id="pg_177" facs="0207"/>However, the method of
            reunification should in no way be imposed from the outside.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said there was no question of imposition of a solution “from the
            outside”. The U.S. was ready to accept the choice made by the German people. If the
            Germans should express the desire to remain as they were now, that would be all right
            with us.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> commented the Secretary was
            proposing to mix the Germans together and to ask them to make their choice according to
            U.S. concepts. The Soviet Union's view was that there were two German States.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary noted the Soviet Union claimed that only the leaders of the East German
            Government could speak for the people, whereas we said the people should have their say.
            He also said he was not quite sure what Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> meant when he said that we wanted to mix the Germans.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he meant that the Germans would
            be mixed at the polls.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he had in mind separate polls.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Gromyko rejoined that the people in East Germany had already voted. In any event,
            the idea advanced by the Secretary was unrealistic and smelled of mothballs. What we
            should do was to let the two German States get together and discuss their problems.</p>
                    <p>Commenting that he realized Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> was not
            a spokesman for East Germany, the Secretary wondered what Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> would say if he were the East German
            representative and if he, the Secretary, were the West German representative in such
            discussions.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> responded that he would say the two
            countries should improve their relations, and that this was the only way. He said he
            knew the U.S. and West Germany did not like it, but the fact was that this was the only
            realistic way. Sooner or later, East Germany would be recognized, for it was a fact that
            there existed two separate and sovereign German States.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary stressed that if there were to be a psychologically stable solution, the
            German people living in the two parts of Germany would have to have their say in it. If
            there were separate votes in West Germany and East Germany and if the people in East
            Germany did not wish reunification, we would respect their desires, just as a decision
            in the opposite direction should be respected.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> repeated that this was subject to an
            understanding between the two German States. He said he wished to stress that the
            further the rearmament of West Germany and the plans for the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> went, the more difficult a solution would be. No solution was possible
            without disarmament. Indeed, even for an understanding between the two German <pb n="178" xml:id="pg_178" facs="0208"/>States, it was necessary for them to be in the
            same position, i.e., both of them should be disarmed. He said many opportunities had
            been lost in the past, and what had been possible yesterday was not possible today.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he wished to comment on the relationship between the German problem
            and disarmament. If one asked broadly for what purpose the U.S. and U.S.S.R. were
            maintaining such huge forces today, the reply was that they did so because of each
            other. But then, what would the U.S. and U.S.S.R. have to fight about? As we saw it, it
            was almost only over the German problem. Thus, if the German problem were resolved, the
            way towards disarmament would be open. The Secretary recalled his earlier remark to Mr.
              <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that Stalin had made a tactical error;
            had Stalin maintained a quiet repose for 10 years after World War II, there would be no
            need for discussing disarmament today, because the U.S. would have disarmed on its own.
            The reason we had rearmed was the German problem. The Secretary pointed out the solution
            of the German problem and disarmament could go together. He said he knew that this was
            not as simple as it might sound; however, he was convinced that nothing would be so far
            reaching as the solution of the German problem, with the consequential dramatic
            possibilities for disarmament.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary also recalled his earlier remark to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that the U.S. had not been the Soviet Union's ally in World War II
            against the Nazis in order to fight a third world war over the German question. That
            would be foolish. The U.S. was concerned about Germany, but we were confident that the
            present generation in Germany and its leaders wanted peace. Yet nobody could know what
            was going to happen in 20 or 30 years from now either in West Germany or East
            Germany.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he agreed that reunification
            was not possible without disarmament. However, it was not possible without an
            understanding between the two German States either. Nevertheless, he believed that some
            aspects of a German peace settlement could be resolved without disarmament in Europe and
            without denuclearizing the two German States.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary observed that from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s
            remarks, he gathered that the Soviet Union wanted the solution of those aspects to be
            conditioned on the acceptance of its views on the main problems, such as recognition of
            the division of the German people.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that East Germany should be
            recognized, reiterating that a solution of the German problem could be possible only on
            the basis of improved relations between the two German States. If one proceeded on the
            basis of hate and of all kinds of incidents, it was impossible to think of a solution of
            the German problem.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary pointed out that as far as we were concerned, the idea of reunification
            was subject to the will of the German people. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had spoken of the differences between the social systems in the
            two <pb n="179" xml:id="pg_179" facs="0209"/>parts of Germany. We did not know whether
            that factor would influence the decision of the German people. Personally, the Secretary
            said, he thought that the national feelings would prevail just as he was sure they would
            prevail if the Soviet Union or the United States were in a similar situation.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> inquired whether discussion of the
            German problem could be resumed after the Secretary's return from Paris.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary replied that he didn't know and that he would be in touch with Mr.
              <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> after he had discussed this matter with
            his colleagues in Paris.<note n="3" xml:id="d74fn3">See <ref target="#d78">Document

                    <p>At the experts meeting on December twelfth,<note n="2" xml:id="d75fn2">A memorandum of
              conversation is ibid.</note> I gave a fairly full account of your discussions with
              <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>,<note n="3" xml:id="d75fn3">See <ref target="#d74">Document 74</ref>.</note> including hint of Soviet willingness to
            resume dialogue with us. The only thing I omitted was the indication that the Soviet
            intention was to begin with troop presence in West Berlin and the question of access.
            There was general agreement that the Soviets would not be receptive to any proposals on
            the German problem which were couched in traditional terms of Four Power responsibility
            for reunification based on self-determination, all-German elections, etc. The German
            side nevertheless put forward three versions of an “initiative,” the texts of which are
              attached.<note n="4" xml:id="d75fn4">Not found with the source text.</note> Number one
            calls for the establishment of a “Standing Council of the Four Powers for Germany,” in
              <pb n="180" xml:id="pg_180" facs="0210"/>order to reduce tensions and achieve
            reunification. This is the type of broad language which would run the risks you have
            already foreseen in the unlikely event the Soviets indicated initial acceptance and then
            asked what should be discussed. The other two were generally agreed by the British,
            French and ourselves to be completely unacceptable to the Soviets because of the
            references to elections, reunification and self-determination. The German side maintains
            that some form of initiative is necessary to maintain the faith of East and West Germans
            in eventual reunification and that a proposal to the Soviets along the lines submitted
            would accomplish this result even though it would be rejected by the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>After considerable discussion, the following four points were agreed to be suitable for
            discussion at the Quadripartite dinner Monday night:</p>
                    <p>1. Is an initiative along the lines proposed by the Germans desirable even though we
            recognize that the Soviets would promptly reject it?</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: We feel that it would be a mistake to submit such
            obviously unacceptable proposals to the Soviets. The contents of the more detailed
            proposals would be rejected and we feel that the rejection and almost inevitable
            accompanying counterblast would make the proposals appear as a routine exercise having
            no serious objective and, as such, might have negative repercussions on East German
            opinion. Moreover, it would do nothing to improve Western relations with the Soviets on
            the Berlin problem; on the contrary, owing to the generally accepted view that Russian
            policy in Germany is immobilized by internal considerations, it could harden existing
            Soviet policy on Germany. However, if the Germans insist on the necessity of making a
            proposal to the Soviets, the language of any proposal would have to be worked out
            carefully—and should be remitted to the Ambassadorial Group in Washington.</p>
                    <p>2. Should the proposal be reworded to try to make the establishment of Four Power
            machinery acceptable to the Soviets, by omitting reference to reunification, and
            assigning it some such task as handling current points of friction with the thought it
            might eventually gradually work into dealing with more substantive problems?</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: What the British apparently have in mind is to build on
            a small base—possibly the current Soviet moves to get together in Berlin. Such machinery
            could start with consideration of day-to-day problems in Berlin and then gradually
            spread its umbrella over more important matters such as humanitarian problems, trade and
            economic matters, and, after a substantial period of time, political problems leading to
            unification. This is such vague proposal that it should be considered in more detail at
            a later time by the Ambassadorial Group.</p>
                    <p>3. Should Western substantive positions on the German problem and European Security be
            reexamined?</p>
                    <pb n="181" xml:id="pg_181" facs="0211"/>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: All four Western powers agree that the Soviet internal
            situation rules out Soviet acceptance of any new Western substantive proposals. At the
            same time, the Soviet proposals for reactivating a Quadripartite dialogue in Berlin (or
            at least in Western Berlin) suggests the Soviets wish to open the door by a crack. We
            feel we should do nothing to discourage the Soviets in this direction, particularly if
            it turns out that the Soviets are willing to re-emphasize Quadripartite responsibility
            for Berlin as a whole. We see no need for re-examination.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">4. Timing of any initiative.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: It is interesting to note that even the Germans,
            although pushing the idea of an “initiative” doggedly, are not in a particular rush to
            do anything. They recognize the aura of political uncertainty now prevailing in the East
            and they note the Moscow meeting of Communist leaders just scheduled for March first. We
            will also need to define clearly what we are proposing to negotiate before we agree to a
            proposal to negotiate. Thus it is unlikely that we will have anything before mid-March
            or April.</p>
                    <p>The question could also put to Schroeder whether it would not be wise to await further
            Soviet response to the query which the Germans have put to the Russians whether the
            projected visit to the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> will be picked up by the new
            Kremlin leadership.</p>
                    <p>It might be argued that no new German initiative should be undertaken until after the
            international meeting of Communist parties has taken place (the latest information is
            that a preparatory meeting will convene on March first although no information about
            place, participants, or terms of reference is now known).</p>
                    <p>The French are likely to cite the current <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>
            negotiations as another reason for delay.</p>

                    <p>Foreign Minister Schroeder said that he had been disappointed with Saturday's
            Quadripartite discussions.<note n="2" xml:id="d76fn2">December 12; see <ref target="#d75">Document 75</ref>.</note> While he recognized that <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> had
            both informally raised the idea of a Four-Power body on Germany with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, there was no reason not to approach the Soviets
            more formally with the idea. He recognized the chance of acceptance was practically nil.
            However, this was not a criterion. The question for Germany is, would such a reminder of
            Four Power responsibility be useful? His answer was yes. It would counter the ever
            repeated Soviet thesis that the problem of Germany is for the two Germanys to settle. It
            was an urgent German requirement that this be put forth officially and jointly to the
            Soviets. He did not feel that this should depend on the prior working out of a complete
            plan on Germany and the security problem. The latter would be difficult and take at
            least 6–12 months. The French would not cooperate at this point. But this does not make
            impossible a move such as Germany now wished. If the Soviets show interest in the idea
            then Western talks can proceed, and it is not necessary to answer all the possible
            questions ahead of time. He personally could see no risk in making such a move. If the
            Soviets do not accept the proposal there would be no harm in having made it. However,
            there is harm if nothing is done. “My very serious and frank request to the United
            States is to be cooperative in this project.” There is a much bigger risk in Germany and
            for international public opinion if discussions continue as at present with the Soviets
            on marginal subjects. (He noted he had no objection to these discussions if they did not
            touch on vital German interests.)</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked why it would take 6–12 months to agree on answers to questions
            which might be put to us in negotiations with the Soviets. <pb n="183" xml:id="pg_183" facs="0213"/>Schroeder said that he was speaking about coming to an agreement on a
            complete and detailed plan for European security which would settle the status of
            Germany, the problem of alliances, defense, etc. This would take even more than a year
            if it could be done at all. Trying it could only have a negative effect among the allies
            without changing the actual international situation one bit. Development of such a plan
            was completely out of the question as far as France was concerned and maybe even for the
              <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and US. Nothing could be worked out which was
            realistic in terms of acceptability to the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>That is why Germany favors the most modest starting point: an appeal to Four Power
            responsibility. Let the Soviets reject this. The West would have put up a proper
            reminder and German public opinion would gain the necessary impression of Four Power
            desire to deal with Germany as a whole. Such a move could be made very soon, within 4–6
            weeks.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> noted that timing was a
            problem of some moment. The new Soviet Government was working out new lines of policy
            which could be unfavorably influenced by a Western initiative of this nature. Schroeder
            disagreed, noting that the reaction of the new Soviet Government can be anticipated.
            They will not need to think very much before reacting. In the meantime, we would have
            the reminder of Four Power responsibility and we can await the changes in the
            international situation which are required before a realistic plan can be developed.
            Since such an appeal would be within the “framework of the Western thesis,” there should
            be no far-reaching consequences.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary noted his understanding that it would be advantageous to German public
            opinion in the pre-election period to talk generally about reunification, and that there
            would be disadvantages in talking about frontiers, arms control or security guarantees.
            The trouble is that discussions with the Soviets cannot be so limited. President
              <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> will ask him what the Soviet reaction
            will be to any course of action we recommend. The Soviets may make counterproposals or
            ask questions, “a, b, c and d.” Are we ready to deal with these on an allied basis? We
            are not now prepared to deal with the consequences of what we may initiate.</p>
                    <p>Schroeder said he thought there is an answer to these observations. The high
            probability is that the Soviets will reject an appeal. On the other hand, there is
            nothing they could say which we would not know how to answer. Unless there is something
            sensationally new in favor of the West from the Soviets, we have answers to all possible
            Soviet questions. These have all been agreed in the past year. What Germany wants is
            nothing more than repeating the Western position in some suitably diplomatic form, such
            as a Three-Power note containing a proposal to the Soviets.</p>
                    <pb n="184" xml:id="pg_184" facs="0214"/>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> asked if it were really in
            the interest of the German public to court an abrupt Soviet rejection. He was surprised
            at Schroeder's view that this would be helpful. Schroeder agreed that it would be
            necessary to discuss the precise formula to be used. It may not be necessary to refer
            explicitly to “reunification.” We could talk in terms of a Four-Power body to deal with
            “Germany as a whole.” The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> was extremely grateful for
            the President's Georgetown policy speech<note n="3" xml:id="d76fn3">For text of the

            attempt to bring about discussion with the other side. He said that if the US were
            forthcoming, the French and British would come along. That is why he strongly hoped to
            be able to rely on U.S. support.</p>

                    <p>773. For the Ambassador from the Secretary. In view of Bonn's 2324<note n="2" xml:id="d77fn2">Dated December 17. (Ibid.)</note> I want you to get a little personal
            view of the core of the problem as it appeared at our quadripartite dinner on the
            subject of an initiative on German unification. The big question the other three had to
            examine was whether the German attitude toward an initiative was serious from an
            international point of view or was merely a somewhat empty international gesture
            designed to meet the internal political requirements of the present government in
            Germany. Quite frankly, I had the impression that during the period before the election
            the Germans wanted to be talking about reunification but were adamantly opposed to
            talking about the inevitable accompanying questions such as frontiers, security
            arrangements in Europe, disarmament and such other issues as would inevitably arise in
            discussing unification. From my point of view there was another issue involving
            particularly France. In 1961–62 I spent almost <pb n="185" xml:id="pg_185" facs="0215"/>two years talking with the Russians to ascertain whether there was any basis for
            negotiation and at times found myself almost alone because of the French attitude. If
            there is to be a public diplomatic initiative, I want to be sure that the French mean it
            and are prepared to stay on board; else I should be looking around and asking “where is
            everybody.”</p>
                    <p>As I have just told you I will be seeing <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
            on Saturday and will try to find out whether they have any interest in informal
            four-power talks on the German question, without agenda, in order to explore whether
            some progress might be made. I shall keep you informed and would want you to keep in
            prompt touch with Schroeder so that he will feel that we are trying to work as closely
            with him as possible.</p>

                    <p>The Secretary recalled Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s remark to
            the President<note n="2" xml:id="d78fn2">See <ref target="#d74fn1">footnote 1, Document
                74</ref>.</note> that he did not exclude the possibility of new elements in the
            Soviet position. He wondered whether there was anything Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> could say now.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> confirmed he had made such a remark
            to the President with respect to Western forces in West Berlin. However, no exchange of
            views on the problem was now taking place. Indeed, on the <pb n="186" xml:id="pg_186" facs="0216"/>basis of the Secretary's remarks on the German question, he did not see
            much prospect for progress. The Secretary had been referring to such matters as
            unification, disarmament, etc., and it was difficult to imagine movement on that
            basis.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary pointed out that the three governments on the Western side were
            necessarily involved in the German problem. As a result of World War II, the U.S., the
            U.K., and France have specific responsibilities and rights. It would be difficult to
            have discussions on a bilateral basis because we did not know what new elements the
            Soviet Union had in mind and also because we did not know whether we could deliver
            anything that might be agreed upon in the absence of the other parties concerned. In any
            event, there was a range of matters on which further movement should be possible. We
            were pleased with the Christmas pass arrangement and perhaps the four parties could sit
            down informally and see what could be done to move further in that direction. Of course,
            our approaches to the German problem were different, but perhaps it would be useful to
            discuss, without any agenda, the whole range of questions involved in it. The Secretary
            said he would advise against such discussions as could produce crises, of which we had
            had enough already. He also pointed out that he was not proposing anything formally. He
            had not been instructed to do so, but he thought perhaps it would be useful to look at
            the whole range of questions and see where progress could be made. The Secretary said he
            could not make any formal proposal to this effect until he knew Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s reaction.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said the Soviet Union was ready to
            enter into discussions, but he wished to stress that to tie reunification, disarmament,
            and other problems of that magnitude into one knot was unrealistic, and it would be
            difficult to have discussions on that basis. Discussions should take place on a
            realistic basis and the Soviet Union believed that there were possibilities for
            understanding on some of the points discussed earlier. The Soviet Union had come to this
            conclusion on the basis of previous talks, but to have talks on a new basis would be
            difficult. The Soviet Union was prepared to have discussions, but what would be their
            purpose?</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that to take the least, perhaps progress could be made in the
            humanitarian area, such as reunion of families, expansion of cultural exchanges, etc.
            Frankly, he did not believe that such discussions would lead to a final solution of the
            German problem. However, some progress could still be made.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> suggested that humanitarian aspects
            could be worked out and agreed upon between the two Germanies, as had already been done
            in certain areas. However, such understandings did not move us towards the solution of
            serious problems which still remained unsettled.</p>
                    <pb n="187" xml:id="pg_187" facs="0217"/>
                    <p>The Secretary wondered what level Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
            had in mind in suggesting bilateral discussions. He personally would be quite busy over
            the next several weeks in connection with preparations for the President's State of the
            Union message and other matters. Did Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
            have in mind our Ambassadors or perhaps some other level?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said the U.S. should inform the
            Soviet side when it was ready to start discussions. We had two capitals and perhaps
            discussions could rotate between them. The Soviet Union was prepared to have discussions
            on a realistic basis at any time, and it was up to the U.S. to decide when. The problem
            of European security was very important to the Soviet Union; it concerned the Soviet
            Union's own security as well as that of its allies.</p>

              <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>.</p>
                    <p>1. Message from the President.</p>
                    <p>I saw Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> this morning at 9,
            just before he went into a Cabinet meeting scheduled for 9:30. I advised <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> that I had just returned from the US where I had
            seen President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> at his Ranch.<note n="2" xml:id="d79fn2">According to President Johnson's Daily Diary, he met with <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> at the <gloss target="#t_LBJ1">LBJ</gloss>
              Ranch from 10:45 a.m. to 11:15 a.m. on December 30, 1964. The two men also talked by
              long distance telephone on January 3 when <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> called from Middleburg, Virginia. (Ibid.) No record of either
              conversation was found.</note> The President had asked me to extend his warm greetings
            to the Chancellor. He had recalled his very satisfactory meeting with the Chancellor at
            the Ranch and had asked me to tell the Chancellor that he looked forward to a return
            visit with him in Bonn. The President had also reaffirmed his continued interest in
            German reunification, and had asked me to point out to the Chancellor the reference he
            proposed to make to this in his State of the Union Message.<note n="3" xml:id="d79fn3">For text of the State of the Union address, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of
                the Presidents of the United States: <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B.

                    <pb n="188" xml:id="pg_188" facs="0218"/>
                    <p>The Chancellor expressed appreciation for the President's greetings and statements. The
            President's presence in Europe was badly needed. There had been many bilateral visits in
            Europe, i.e., he was visiting both <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> and
              <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> soon.<note n="4" xml:id="d79fn4">January
              19–20.</note> However, only a visit by the President could serve to ease the “tensions
            and difficulties” that now exist in Europe. He welcomed the President's statement on a
            European visit as contained in his State of the Union Message.</p>
                    <p>2. Reunification.</p>
                    <p>Since today's Cabinet meeting had been called mainly to discuss the alleged change in
            US policy regarding an initiative toward reunification arising out of the “backgrounder”
            held in Washington on December 30,<note n="5" xml:id="d79fn5">The text of the
              Secretary's comments was transmitted to the Embassy in telegram 1876 to Bonn, December
              31, 1964. (Department of State, Central Files, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss>
              32–4 <gloss target="#t_GER1">GER</gloss>)</note> I dealt next with this subject. I
            explained that there was no change in US policy or tactics towards an initiative on
            reunification. What had been stated in the backgrounder conformed to what the Secretary
            of State had told FonMin Schroeder during his recent visit to Washington<note n="6" xml:id="d79fn6">See <ref target="#d73">Document 73</ref>.</note>—indeed, what he had
            been saying in all discussions on this subject for many months. It is not a question of
            our desire to seek reunification by all feasible means, but what could be expected to be
            accomplished by a particular initiative at this time.</p>
                    <p>I referred to the references to reunification in the President's Georgetown speech and
            in his State of the Union message. I gave orally from the verbatim text of the
            backgrounder the statements made as to the importance of a solution of the German
            problem. In the light of his experience, however, the Secretary was convinced [that]
            before a serious initiative could be undertaken, answers on an agreed Four-Power basis
            must be found to certain questions which the Soviets might raise. This did not mean
            answers to all questions at the outset, but at least enough so as not to be caught off
            balance by the Soviets. I pointed out that the US, through a series of discussions by
            President <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName>, President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>, and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> with Soviet FonMin <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, as
            well as by our Ambassadors in Moscow, had been pushing for an opening for an initiative
            almost continuously since 1961.</p>
                    <p>The most recent discussions in this series had been held as recently as early December,
            between the Secretary and the President, and <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>.<note n="7" xml:id="d79fn7">See <ref target="#d74">Document
                74</ref> and <ref target="#d79fn1">footnote 1</ref> thereto.</note> Both had probed
            deeply with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, however, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had made it clear that he had no desire to talk
            about reunification—only subjects such as Western troops in West Berlin, security of the
            Soviet bloc, borders, non-aggression pact, thin-out, denuclearization of Germany, and
              <pb n="189" xml:id="pg_189" facs="0219"/>sovereignty of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>—subjects which the Germans and we had no desire to speak about. I was
            sure that the Germans did not have in mind a mere propaganda effort, i.e. the floating
            of a proposal which would immediately be shot down in front of the German people. Such a
            maneuver would be so patently transparent that it would unquestionably create an adverse
            popular reaction.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor confirmed that this was not what the German Government had in mind. He
            referred to reports that we had, in the backgrounder, inferred that we did not wish to
            support the present <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> government politically through
            the making of an initiative. I said that no such inference had been given. I recalled to
            the Chancellor the fact that in the Four-Power discussions preceding the recent <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> meeting,<note n="8" xml:id="d79fn8">See <ref target="#d75">Documents 75</ref> and <ref target="#d77">77</ref>.</note> the US and
            Britain had agreed to the strongest statement on a reunification initiative that had yet
            been considered by the Four, only to have it turned down by the French. The Chancellor
            asked why in our judgment the French had turned it down. I replied that it appeared to
            have been the result of a momentary reaction by the French <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> to the position the Germans had taken in the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> on the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>.<note n="9" xml:id="d79fn9">
                            <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName>'s response appears to have been based
              on the summary report in circular telegram 1152, December 20; see <ref target="frus1964-68v13#d66">
                                <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1964–1968, vol. XIII, Document
              66</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>As evidence of the sincerity of our desire to see reunification pushed ahead, the
            Secretary had authorized me to propose to the <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>,
            which I had already done in a preliminary way last evening:</p>
                    <p>1) that Four-Power discussions as envisaged in the agreement which was under discussion
            in Paris be resumed, if acceptable to the other three, in Bonn by the Bonn Group.</p>
                    <p>2) that Schroeder himself join the Secretary, the French <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>, and the British FonSec when they gather in New York for the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> meeting, for further discussions on the initiative.</p>
                    <p>I emphasized that nothing should be said publicly about those proposals since agreement
            had not been obtained from the British and French. However, if the Germans agreed we
            would undertake to obtain their approval.</p>
                    <p>3. <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor asked the significance of the announced abandonment of the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> organization within the State Department.<note n="10" xml:id="d79fn10">Reference is to a James Reston article in <hi rend="italic">The New

            Circular 1158,<note n="11" xml:id="d79fn11">For text, see <ref target="frus1964-68v13#d65">
                                <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1964–1968, vol. XIII, Document
              65</ref>.</note> I advised the Chancellor that we have not lost interest in the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. We, the <pb n="190" xml:id="pg_190" facs="0220"/>Germans, and certain others had developed a position on the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, concerning which the British and others had raised certain questions.
            Since we seek a solution to the question of nuclear responsibility within the Alliance
            on as broad a basis as possible, we are willing to abandon our initial position in
            moving toward a broader consensus, which we hope will come out of the meeting planned
            this month between the interested nations. In arriving at this consensus we do not wish
            to assert pressures or create deadlines. We insist that any arrangement take care of the
            legitimate interests of Germany, as well as those of the other European states involved.
            Our position toward the French, I continued, was that we did not wish to do anything
            directed against them and wished to advise them fully of what we proposed to do. If they
            are not willing to participate now, we wished to leave the door open for them in the
            future. Although we do not expect them to join, we have some basis to hope that they
            will in the end acquiesce in whatever arrangement is made. When the force de frappe is
            operational the French have indicated that they will be willing to coordinate in some
            way its planning and targeting.</p>
                    <p>4. Bloc credits.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor said with some feeling that he had once had hopes that the Germans could
            make a contribution to their relations with the Soviets and to reunification by offering
            large-scale assistance to the Soviets in return for political concessions. This was now
            no longer “politically realistic,” since Germany's allies were offering credits to the
            Soviets.</p>
                    <p>I replied that I assumed he did not include the US Government, which has not offered
            such credits. Minister <persName corresp="#p_WL5">Westrick</persName> indicated,
            however, that there was a possibility that the American firms supplying East Germany
            with a synthetic fiber plant might offer credits on a private basis. I said that I had
            seen no evidence to this effect, however, I would look into the matter and advise them.
            I pointed out that US law, as well as government policy, prevented the granting of such
            credits.</p>
                    <p>5. Review of policy.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor said that he wished to discuss with me further, when there was more
            time, what he termed as a “balance sheet,” which he could use in his forthcoming
            discussions with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName>. He would, for example, like to discuss further
            the question of the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. He thought it significant that
              <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> had now postponed his press
            conference until after the Chancellor's visit. His implication was that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> was thereby putting pressure on him to be more
            accommodating during his visit.</p>
                    <p>Comment: I saw the Chancellor immediately upon his return from a vacation at Tegern
            See, to which he will return for three more days on Thursday. He had had only a few
            moments to be briefed by <persName corresp="#p_WL5">Westrick</persName>, however, he
            appeared quite relaxed about the reunification initiative issue <pb n="191" xml:id="pg_191" facs="0221"/>which has been boiling in the German press. I believe
            that what I told him will enable him to cope with the questions raised in his Cabinet
            meeting. I also believe that the government will now feel itself in a position to take
            action to dampen down press discussion of alleged changes in US policy on reunification.
            Federal press spokesman <persName corresp="#p_HKG1">Von Hase</persName> will be holding
            a press conference later today. I will myself hold separate backgrounders with both the
            German and American press.</p>
                    <p>What is not yet clear is how <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> and
            Schroeder will themselves come through this latest flurry. Apart from some <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> murmurings about the lack of an imaginative government
            approach, the Chancellor and his <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> have so far
            escaped much direct criticism because of concentration on US policy. The next phase
            might, however, bring some shift of emphasis to the inadequacies of Bonn policy which
            have brought about the present situation.</p>
                    <p>In connection with the Chancellor's suggestion for a discussion leading to the creation
            of a “balance sheet” for his forthcoming meetings, the Embassy will put forward to the
            Department suggestions as to the positions we should take on the various outstanding
            issues. The Chancellor was particularly heartened by the indication given in the
            President's State of the Union Message that he would be visiting Europe soon.</p>

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName> said he was calling at his
            own initiative. He stated that he had two questions. The first was what do you consider
            we four do next on the German question? He said there was a strong and growing feeling
            regarding the reunification question in Germany. He cited an article by Zehrer in <hi rend="italic">Die Welt</hi> entitled “The German Disquiet”. According to the
            Ambassador this urge for reunification was becoming more and more a trauma. The feeling
            regarding reunification was no longer entirely rational, but approaching a state of
            hysteria. The Ambassador said he felt personally that after twenty years of frustration,
            there might be hot-heads who would lead demonstrations. He said that this brought
            terrible pressure on the government. The upcoming elections had also to be kept in mind.
            At the same time, according to the Ambassador, there was greater recognition on the part
            of the Germans that they would not get something for nothing. He spoke of a certain
            readiness to consider other matters in connection with the reunification question,
            mentioning the territorial and boundary questions. The Ambassador said this growing
            readiness to consider other questions was, of course, not to be confused with
            concessions. The Ambassador thought this is what the Secretary had in mind when he gave
            his backgrounder at the end of the year.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador said that the recent blow the Germans had suffered on the reunification
            initiative was actually one of two blows, the other one being what he called the change
            on <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> policy, from the old <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> to a combination of <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>. He said confidentially that this change had resulted in
            a storm in the Cabinet against Foreign Minister Schroeder and that he had been
            reproached for pursuing a policy already buried by the Americans. The Ambassador's
            second question, therefore, was what do you envisage on the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>?</p>
                    <p>The Secretary, referring to growing German anxieties, said that one can perhaps
            understand sensitivities without conceding they were justified. He added that we were
            growing sensitive about growing sensitivities in Germany. He said that we must
            understand that sensitivities create counter-sensitivities.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that on the reunification question, only the United States in the
            West had followed a clear, simple and persistent policy over the years. He pointed out
            that he had raised the German question in every serious conversation he had had with the
            Russians on any subject. He said that these attempts on his part to keep the question
            alive with the Russians had been made at least twice a year.</p>
                    <pb n="193" xml:id="pg_193" facs="0223"/>
                    <p>The Secretary said that there were two problems in this connection which bothered him.
            The first was that if we are to take an initiative, we must be serious about it. We
            cannot rely on a negative response from the Russians. We must be prepared for a Russian
            counter-suggestion. If the Russians seriously suggest that we get our troops out of
            Berlin, we would immediately have the crisis of 1958 with the concomitant expense of
            billions of dollars and tremendous expenditure of time and effort. The Secretary
            emphasized that we must be prepared to face the alternatives and the Four must be
            together on this. He reminded the Ambassador that he had been through this before. He
            reiterated that if we take an international step, we must be prepared for the
            consequences.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that his second observation on this subject was that reunification
            was very complex, having many parts. The most obvious problem related to reunification
            is the frontier question. The Secretary added you are really talking about a peace
            treaty when you are talking about reunification.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he had told Foreign Minister Schroeder that it was easy for him to
            envisage the first statement made by each of the participants at a reunification
            negotiation, but what he did not see as clearly were the second speeches on the second
            day. The Secretary said that he had had the impression during recent months that what
            the Germans wished to discuss was reunification in its narrowest sense, and that they
            had been reluctant to face the questions of frontiers, security arrangements and
            disarmament, elements which were inseparably linked.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that he would suggest for the immediate future that Chancellor
              <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>, during his visit with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>, make sure that he have a private, serious and
            extended discussion with the General on the subject of reunification. The Secretary
            added that he was making this recommendation against the background of his own
            conversations with General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that although he had not mentioned this to the British and French,
            he would see a point in having Schroeder come to New York some time during the United
            Nations General Assembly after Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s talk with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>, and
            possibly meet with him and the British and French for further discussion of the subject.
            The Secretary said that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> had
            mentioned this to Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that he was interested in the Ambassador's observation, that there
            was now a readiness to look at substantive questions related to reunification.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador repeated his belief that readiness is growing to discuss such topics. He
            referred in this connection to a recent speech by <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>
            Parliamentarian Gradl. He added that the difficulty was not reduced by discussion of the
            question by political parties in Germany during <pb n="194" xml:id="pg_194" facs="0224"/>an election year. The Ambassador thought that <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>
            Parliamentary leader Barzel would discuss this subject when he visited the United
            States.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he had not had the opportunity to tell Foreign Minister Schroeder in
            Paris that questions raised by the Secretary with the Foreign Minister were really aimed
            at someone else. He reiterated the danger that if we joined in an initiative which
            provides the pretext for the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to return to its 1961
            position, we would have to fly troops in and spend billions of dollars. He added that we
            were ready to do this, to face such an eventuality, but unless there was complete
            solidarity on the part of the Four the American people would question the Secretary's
            actions in bringing about a repeat of the 1961 situation.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador asked the Secretary if he had detected any point of receptivity in his
            talks with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>. The Secretary replied in the
            negative. He said that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> appeared more
            completely negative on the reunification issue than at any other time. The Secretary
            speculated that the twenty-two Soviet divisions in East Germany were no longer there for
            the security of troops in Eastern Germany, but for all of Eastern Europe. He could
            visualize that if the twenty-two divisions left the Soviet Zone of Germany, all of
            Eastern Europe would join Western Europe. The Secretary said that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had said that he was willing to resume a
            discussion bilaterally of questions discussed last year—Berlin, US troops, etc.
              <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, the Secretary added, had told the
            President that he did not discount the possibility that some new elements might enter
            the discussion. The Secretary concluded that when he probed <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> on this point, he received no clue as to what <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had in mind.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he did not believe the Soviets were prepared to discuss
            reunification, or saw any movement in that direction. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had indicated to the Secretary that he was aware of the feelings
            in Europe on this question and saw no sense in creating an illusion there is movement
            when there is none. The Secretary allowed for the possibility that the Soviets might
            come back at some later date with something else.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary assured the Ambassador that despite what <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had said, we were prepared to take an initiative if, as he had
            said earlier, it was serious and we were all aware of the consequences. He reiterated
            his strong belief that considerable advantage was to be gained in Franco-German talks in
            depth and detail in a relaxed atmosphere.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>1. This memorandum suggests a US course of action regarding German unity, for the
            period immediately ahead:</p>
                    <p>(a) The Four Western Foreign Ministers would declare (perhaps when meeting at the GA in
            New York) that they favor, in principle, an initiative, such as the <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> has in mind, for a Four Power Commission on
            Germany, which would provide an umbrella for mixed German commissions. The <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>'s would declare that they have directed a
            quadripartite working group in Bonn to staff out the proposal in greater detail.</p>
                    <p>(b) The Bonn Working Group would then be activated. Its labors could be made the
            subject of considerable public and press comment by the German government between now
            and the election. These labors would include consideration not only of procedures for
            the Four Power Commission and the inter-German committees but also of the substance of
            matters to be considered in that Council, e.g., German frontiers and other security
            aspects of German unity. (Prior to the German elections, it is obviously an open
            question as to how deeply the Germans in the Working Group would consider it feasible to
            delve into such matters of substance, since any leaks on these questions could and would
            be exploited by Strauss and Co. to the disadvantage of Schroeder and <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>. Only time and experience can answer this
            question.)</p>
                    <p>(c) When the <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>'s met for the spring <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting in London, they could review the Working
            Group's efforts and give it further guidance. This would be the occasion for another
            highly publicized communiqué stressing their intent to proceed re German unity.</p>
                    <p>(d) If the three Western <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>'s should then meet
              <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> in Vienna, to celebrate the 10th
            anniversary of the Austrian State Treaty, they could discuss with him, in very general
            terms, the importance of progress toward German unity. They would not unveil the
            specific Four Power Council proposal. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName>'s judgment, expressed on his recent trip, was that the Soviets
            would not accept any proposal on German unity before the German election, for fear of
            strengthening the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>. But even very general
            exhortations by the Western <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>'s, in <pb n="196" xml:id="pg_196" facs="0226"/>their discussions with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, could be made known to the press, with happy results in
            Germany.</p>
                    <p>(e) The specific Four Power proposal could then be put to the Soviets at such time,
            after the German election, as it had been staffed out in sufficient detail to be
            plausibly presented—and to be effectively executed if the Soviets should agree to set up
            the Council.</p>
                    <p>2. This proposal is designed to meet two needs:</p>
                    <p>(a) to generate further quadripartite Western staff work in spelling out the specific
            substance of a German unity proposal;</p>
                    <p>(b) to provide evidence of tangible progress which the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> moderates could put to good use in repelling attacks by the German
            Gaullists.</p>
                    <p>The second of these needs is of crucial importance. The nationalists are clearly out to
            get, first, Schroeder (whose position is highly vulnerable) and then <persName corresp="#p_HKU1">Von Hassel</persName>. They would expect <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>, if success crowns their efforts, to accommodate
            to the changed center of gravity in his party. If the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> thus comes under increasing nationalist influence the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> might be compelled to follow suit, in the degree that
            this commodity proved popular; the lesson of Weimar is that no major German political
            party can allow nationalism to be the monopoly of the opposition. Thus, the basic object
            of our postwar European policy—the maintenance of German moderate leadership—would be
            placed in some jeopardy.</p>
                    <p>3. The basic assumptions underlying this proposal are that:</p>
                    <p>(a) The German proposal for a Four Power Council and inter-German committees is the
            most promising basis on which to proceed with further staff work. No one can predict in
            advance whether substantive discussions in the Four Power Council would prove fruitful;
            this Council might turn out to be no more than a forum for rehashing past Western and
            Soviet positions. In this case, the Council (meeting, perhaps, rather infrequently)
            might prove important chiefly in providing cover for the inter-German committees, where
            useful work might well be done.</p>
                    <p>(b) Quadripartite staff discussion of the German proposal for a Four Power Council will
            only be useful, in the long run, if it gets into the subjects covered in your recent
            backgrounder, in its consideration of proposals to be advanced in the Four Power
            Council. We would have to make this clear to the Germans from the start (although, as
            suggested above, it may well be that the most serious staff work in this respect will
            only be undertaken after the German elections).</p>
                    <p>4. The French will have little incentive to go along with the course of action proposed
            in this memo. The main purpose of that course—the strengthening of German moderate
            leadership—is one that they do not share. They want to see Schroeder weakened, so that
            he can be replaced by a German Gaullist.</p>
                    <p>The French might be moved, however, if it were evident that the US, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, and <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> were prepared to
            proceed with the public declaration and <pb n="197" xml:id="pg_197" facs="0227"/>the
            necessary staff work, without the French, if need be. There may be inoffensive ways of
            intimating this to Couve in New York, before France's position is fixed. The French
            might well fear that continuing French isolation on this issue would place a heavy
            strain upon their allies in Germany: Refusing, day in and day out, to join in allied
            consideration of the issue which, more than any other, interests German public opinion
            is not the way to make the flowers of Gaullism bloom across the Rhine.</p>
                    <p>5. It may be useful to make our willingness to proceed along the lines described in
            this memorandum known to <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>, before he
            visits <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>. He will feel better able to
            stand up to Gaullist pressures and blandishments, in the course of that meeting, if he
            knows that the US is ready to back him strongly on the unity issue. It would probably
            not be useful for him to do more than stress the importance of the German unity issue
            and the need for further discussion of specific tactics among <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>'s in his talk with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>.
            If he unveils the details of the course of action proposed above, this might only
            trigger a premature French rejection—since he could hardly lay out what may be the most
            convincing pro argument: The fact that a possible Western willingness to proceed with
            further staff work without France, if necessary, cannot be wholly precluded.
            Furthermore, our suggesting to <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> at this
            point that he propose this course to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>
            might tend to confirm German suspicions that the US intends to withdraw from a role of
            active leadership and leave the Germans to bear the main burden from here on out.</p>

                    <p>2545. Subj: Reunification initiative. I called on <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> Schroeder yesterday (Jan 7) at my request. I had spoken to him in a
            preliminary way on Monday, Jan 4, following my return from the US, at which time I had
            conveyed to him the Secretary's suggestion that he might wish to consider joining the
            Secretary, the French <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> and the British FonSec,
            during the period they would be together at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, to
            discuss the question <pb n="198" xml:id="pg_198" facs="0228"/>of an initiative on German
            reunification. I also indicated at that time that if it were agreeable to the British
            and French, we would be willing to initiate further Four-Power talks in the Bonn Group
            preparatory to such a meeting.</p>
                    <p>Schroeder said that his attendance at the proposed New York meeting on a unification
            initiative would depend on a number of factors: when it would be held, what the agenda
            would be, etc. The situation had been somewhat changed by the Departmental backgrounder
            given on this subject on Dec 30. It was always difficult for the German Govt to
            authorize the <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> to go to New York during a
              <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> meeting, since he would not be involved in the
              <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> deliberations themselves. Moreover, to take such an
            unusual step under present circumstances might arouse undue expectations. He would,
            however, be willing to go if there were a chance of getting approval on the German
            Four-Power Council proposal. Otherwise it might be best to continue discussions between
            governments. He had not yet been able to reach a decision on the question of whether
            further discussions on reunification should be held by the Bonn Group. He could see
            certain advantages, however, there were also advantages in continuing discussions in the
            Washington Ambassadorial Group, where the American representative, who is the principal
            one concerned, would have better access to instructions.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> then went into the background of his
            recent espousal of the Four-Power Council concept. He had presented this idea in his
            meeting with Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> on Nov
              23,<note n="2" xml:id="d82fn2">See <ref target="#d73">Document 73</ref>.</note> as
            well as during his subsequent meetings in Rome and London prior to the Paris
              meeting.<note n="3" xml:id="d82fn3">Reference is to the North Atlantic Council
              Ministerial Meeting at Paris December 15–17, 1964.</note> In his discussion with the
            Secretary in Paris prior to the evening Quadripartite dinner,<note n="4" xml:id="d82fn4">Reported in telegram Secto 13 from Paris, December 15, 1964. (Department of State,
              Central Files, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 15–1 <gloss target="#t_GER1">GER</gloss> W)</note> he had obtained the impression that the Secretary would
            support the proposal. The evening meeting resulted in no specific agreement, but in the
            general agreement that representatives of the Four would prepare a draft communiqué.</p>
                    <p>It was his impression that during this meeting the French pursued the tactic of
            attempting to get <gloss target="#t_Sec1">Sec</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and FonSec Gordon Walker to raise questions,
            to which they would then agree. During these discussions the Secretary had presented
            arguments very similar to those contained in the Washington backgrounder. Schroeder was
            at a loss to know who had given the impression to the press that the Secretary had been
            reluctant with respect to an initiative. The Germans had not done this. On Wednesday, it
            had been agreed that the Four-Power Council concept <pb n="199" xml:id="pg_199" facs="0229"/>would be discussed further between governments. However, the French
            refused to sign the final communiqué because of the inclusion of the phrase “that the
            time had come to take appropriate steps to that end with the Soviet Union.”</p>
                    <p>Although he had not discussed it with the French, it was Schroe-der's impression that
            they would still agree to discuss the Four-Power Council idea, although without any
            prior commitment to support it. However, no agreement had been reached in Paris as to
            the time and place of such discussions. In view of the backgrounder, and the Cabinet
            discussion on Tuesday, it was necessary that the entire matter now be reviewed, both
            within the Cabinet and with the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Bundestag, which
            includes representatives of the other political parties. Since all concerned would be in
            Berlin together next week, an opportunity would be afforded.</p>
                    <p>Schroeder said that there was a difference between his original proposals and the
            version now being dealt with in the press. He did not propose putting forward a proposal
            to the Russians for a Four-Power Council meeting to consider reunification alone, which
            he knew would be turned down. Although he did not believe that a probable Soviet
            rejection was in itself a sufficient reason for not making a proposal, he agreed that
            any proposal made should be a serious one. He understood from what we had told him about
              <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s meetings with the Secretary and the
            President that the Soviets would probably insist on keeping reunification separate from
            other issues. The Soviets would undoubtedly introduce many topics for discussion which
            the other three would prefer not to discuss.</p>
                    <p>Schroeder, however, still favors putting forward a proposal for a Four-Power Council
            meeting to consider the German problem as a whole. This would not be a new departure but
            would be based on the principle of Four-Power responsibility, which is still a reality
            with respect to certain problems. He would be willing for the Council to be called
            without a specific mandate. He did not consider it necessary for the Western Four to
            agree in advance on the answers to all questions that might be raised in the Four-Power
            Council. It should be possible to eliminate those Soviet proposals which we did not wish
            to discuss, just as they undoubtedly would seek to do with respect to issues distasteful
            to them. As a minimum the Council could create a series of Four-Power commissions, which
            might be able to make progress in their respective fields.</p>
                    <p>What, he asked, is the risk in making such a proposal, even if it is turned down? The
            basic question is whether the making of such a proposal would, in its overall aspects,
            be helpful or harmful. From a German viewpoint he believes it necessary to have strong
            statements made by the Allies on reunification, such as the President's Georgetown
            speech, and positive steps, such as his own current proposal, taken in common by the <pb n="200" xml:id="pg_200" facs="0230"/>British, French and the US, even if the Soviets
            turned them down. He pointed out that the Sovs continually reiterate their own positions
            with respect to all-German questions. Why should we not?</p>
                    <p>I indicated to the <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> that our position on the
            question of an initiative is the same as that which the Secretary had agreed to in
            Paris. We had made certain suggestions to the <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>
            as to how we might proceed and would await his reply. Both were subject to approval by
            the British and French. He was familiar with the Secretary's views. Certainly he
            recognized that there are certain points of substance which must be agreed to before a
            proposal can be made to the Soviets. The Secretary has never said that the answers to
            all questions must be determined in advance.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: As to whether in practice Schroeder's thinking on the
            issues which I discussed with him will correspond to that of the <gloss target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss>, I do not know. I believe that the area of agreement
            can be determined only in terms of specifics—not through general discussion. My own
            feeling is that we would, in connection with any detailed consideration of the
            Four-Power Council proposal, not be far apart.</p>
                    <p>Tuesday's Cabinet discussion did not result in any decision as to the course the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> will pursue on the initiative issue. I do not anticipate
            that we shall have any further reaction from the <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> until the end of next week after the meetings in Berlin. In the
            meantime, if the Dept has any further guidance to give me as to our own stance at this
            juncture, it would be appreciated.</p>

                    <p>2558. Subject: Malaise in Germany. Germany is at the moment in a near crisis of
            confidence with respect to its external relations. As a part of this malaise a series of
            recent developments has, moreover, created a situation in our own relations with the
            Federal Republic which, at best, can be described as awkward. A typical view, conveyed
            to us last week by Jean Monnet's assistant, Max Kohnstamm, who has been seeing German
            officials in Bonn, is that the Germans are aware that their foreign policy has suffered
            a number of reversals recently and that nearly all have in some degree involved the
            United States. Most important, he claims, is the general interpretation given our much
            publicized National Security Action Memorandum,<note n="2" xml:id="d83fn2">See <ref target="#d79fn11">footnote 11, Document 79</ref>.</note> to the effect that the U.S.
            has abandoned the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> and has thereby suffered a major
            political defeat at <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>'s hands. The net
            effect, according to Kohnstamm, will inevitably be to support the Gaullist group in the
              <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_CSU1">CSU</gloss> and drive the
            Germans closer to the French.</p>
                    <p>I do not believe that this view dominates <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s thinking. I believe he still places highest priority on his
            relations with us. Schroeder personally does not have a French alternative, however, he
            has given me the clear impression that he feels “let down”—both in connection with the
            MLF and his proposal for a reunification initiative. Many German officials and party
            leaders go further in questioning whether their foreign policy has not run into a dead
            end and does not, therefore, require some radical revision. <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_CSU1">CSU</gloss> Fraktion leader Barzel, for example,
            has recently expressed views of this kind, while <gloss target="#t_FDP1">FDP</gloss>
            Vice Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_ME4">Mende</persName> has publicly called for more
            emphasis on German national interests in the formulation of policy. There are
            predictions of substantially closer German accommodations to the policies of de Gaulle
            during <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s meeting with him on Jan 19.</p>
                    <p>To recapitulate: Starting with the Paris meetings early in December, the Germans seem
            to have suffered one rebuff after another. Schroeder returned from Paris after a
            much-publicized failure to obtain Allied agreement on a communiqué stressing the
            desirability of an initiative on German reunification. Although the basic French
            responsibility for this has generally been recognized, there has also been much comment
            to the effect that the lack of U.S. enthusiasm played an important role. The public <pb n="202" xml:id="pg_202" facs="0232"/>distortion of the backgrounder of December 30 has
            served to bring into question our basic attitude toward the whole concept of an
            initiative.</p>
                    <p>Although the German Government gained some stature from its hard decision on the grain
            price problem, there has been continuing criticism from farm groups that the government
            has sold out their interests, and from others for having acted too late or for having
            failed to exact anything substantial in return for German concessions. There is a
            feeling that despite the sacrifice Germany made on the grain price, it has earned
            nothing from <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>—i.e., Schroeder's rebuff
            on the initiative came afterwards. The U.S. position in the grain price matter has,
            moreover, been interpreted as having contributed to their lack of success. We appeared
            to be encouraging them in the deal in making a decision which took away some of the
            returns they had expected.</p>
                    <p>Although now put in better perspective, the approval of the construction of a synthetic
            fiber plant in the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> by an American firm was at one
            time widely interpreted as reflecting a change in U.S. policy toward the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. The Germans were mainly influenced by the size of the
            project in comparison with previous American trade with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, and by the fact that we had not advised them in advance of its
            spectacular exposure by a German newspaper.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the widespread belief that the U.S. had in effect abandoned the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> project, or is at least prepared to let it stagnate,
            there exists even in the Foreign Office a feeling that we have left the Germans to
            negotiate the matter out with the British, a task to which they do not feel equal. There
            is wide impression that the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> is “dead.”</p>
                    <p>As a reflection of German sensitivity, which is exceptionally acute at this time, there
            have even been expressions of uncertainty and dismay as result of the comments made by
            the Secretary in his TV interview with Mr. Abel<note n="3" xml:id="d83fn3">For text of
              the January 3 interview, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>,
              January 18, 1965, pp. 62–74.</note> concerning the conditions under which a review
            might be made of the size of our forces here. It seems significant to us that the German
            reaction to the news of French gold purchases has often been more critical of the United
            States than of France. A frequent theme taken up by both press and government officials
            is that the French purchases may do a service to the Western world if they lead to more
            vigorous American action to eliminate our balance of payments deficit. Many German
            editorials tend to view sympathetically the French concern over the continued flow of
            direct U.S. investment to Europe.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s failure up to this point to gain
            acceptance of his proposals for European political integration constitute another

                    <p>The constant German preoccupation is to avoid “falling between stools” which they now

                    <p>In theory the Germans would like to see us reach a rapprochement with France, which
            would take them out of the middle where they feel caught between us. In fact they are
            equally apprehensive that we will make a deal with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName>, whom they think we really value more than they, and that they will
            be left out with no “stool.” President Luebke stated publicly before the German Cabinet
            the other day (Embtel 2530)<note n="6" xml:id="d83fn6">Not found.</note> that the way to
            better German-American relations was to better German-French relations, i.e. presumably
            this will re-arouse our competitive instincts.</p>
                    <p>There is, therefore, a great incentive for <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>—when he meets with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>
            on Jan 19—to attempt to avert further open attacks by de Gaulle and inside attacks by
              <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>'s German followers during the
            election period. In doing so he may be able to retrieve a small place in de Gaulle's
            good graces, and at the same time make us more receptive. In the final analysis the
            Germans, for both their Western and Eastern policies, have to lean on someone. If they
            should become convinced that we will no longer provide the political support, they would
            unquestionably turn toward the French as the next best.</p>

            you privately my own thinking about the various subjects discussed in your several
            cables of the past two days.<note n="2" xml:id="d84fn2">See <ref target="#d83">Document

              provided “guidance for meeting with <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>.”
              (Ibid.)</note> In doing so, I must confess that it is not easy to think about the
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> in the singular nor in terms of a coherent German
            policy. The Chancellor is facing the tiger which he himself created when he permitted
            Adenauer to keep the top Party position. I have not had the feeling that Schroeder
            personally has entered deeply into his job or the major issues of policy confronting the
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. To the extent that he has done so, I have found
            him intelligent, reasonable and a good colleague.</p>

            the German press will be excitable in this preelection period and that there are limits
            beyond which one cannot hope to go in eliciting responsible public discussion of current
            issues. We shall, therefore, be dealing with a feverish friend during the next several
            months. It seems to me that we should try to do so calmly and with complete sympathy and
            friendship while, at the same time, keeping clearly in mind our own heavy
            responsibilities.</p>
                    <pb n="205" xml:id="pg_205" facs="0235"/>
                    <p>The question of an initiative on reunification well illustrates the complexities of
            personal as well as political positions. Simply stated, the United States strongly
            supports the principle of self-determination for the Germans in the Federal Republic and
            in the Soviet zone of occupation. We in the West are committed to the answer reached by
            free plebiscite or some other means of honest consultation; that answer could be a
            divided Germany or a unified Germany; we think it would result in a unified Germany.
            Whichever answer would be reached, a settlement of the problem would require the most
            far-reaching security arrangements in Central Europe as well as some serious disarmament
            and a result could be expected to be a normalization of relations between Western and
            Eastern Europe.</p>
                    <p>Quite frankly, I do not feel that I know what the real British position is on
            reunification nor whether the present British Government would wish to see any progress
            or illusion of progress at the expense of the prospect for the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> in the forthcoming German election. I feel quite certain that Paris is
            not interested in reunification except under circumstances in which Germany would be in
            a position clearly secondary to France.</p>
                    <p>Our response to the German suggestion for an initiative has been to say that we are
            ready to join in a move which is (a) serious, (b) agreed by the four of us, and (c)
            prepared as to substance. We say “serious” because we cannot rely upon the luxury of a
            public Western proposal made on a Wednesday, rejected by the Soviets on a Thursday,
            thereby leaving everybody happy on Friday. Making a proposal is to start something, and
            only the Kremlin can tell us just what. We already know that Moscow wishes to resume the
            bilateral talks on Berlin where they were “left off” in 1962. We already know that
            France won't play on that wicket and Schroeder made the mistake of telling me in Paris
            that such talks would lead to suspicions in Germany about American motives. I could not
            honestly recommend to the President a Western initiative on Germany without telling him
            that one result could be a return by the Soviets to their pressures for peace treaties
            with the two Germanies and a Free City of Berlin. You and I might guess that this would
            not be the result but the President would have to be prepared for whatever the
            consequence, including the possibility of a renewal of the Berlin crisis of 1961 which
            cost the United States many billions of dollars in our defense budget.</p>
                    <p>We have insisted upon a Western Four Power agreement precisely because we have had
            recent experience in talking the Russians out of a Berlin crisis while the French
            disapproved and stood aside, the Germans acted as extremely nervous spectators, and the
            British tried to push us to points in our talks with the Russians on which Western
            allied agreement would have simply been impossible.</p>
                    <p>On the substance of the issues which would arise in discussing reunification, there is
            a serious conflict between German electoral politics <pb n="206" xml:id="pg_206" facs="0236"/>and sober international realities. For electoral purposes, the Germans
            would like to talk about reunification; but for the same reasons they do not wish to
            talk about frontiers, security arrangements or disarmament. The question “reunification
            of what?” will occur in the first five minutes. What disturbs me is that an effort will
            be made to add to the illusion of movement toward reunification the further and demonic
            illusion that Germany is somehow moving toward the frontiers of 1937 or the Munich
            frontiers of 1938. Some German leaders say privately that they realize that the present
            borders of the Federal Republic plus the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> will not be
            changed beyond possible minor border adjustments. But none of them will apparently
            confront that issue publicly. I must tell you that I am deeply concerned about whether
            we ourselves can accept much longer the historical responsibility of silence upon a
            matter which is of such central importance to the peace of Europe and which is now being
            given unilateral agitation within the Federal Republic. The unwillingness of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> to enter seriously into these questions of substance
            lends an air of unreality to their proposals for an initiative. I am not talking about
            “advance concessions” referred to in your tel 2565.<note n="4" xml:id="d84fn4">
                            <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> had commented that the German dilemma
              lay in the fact that any proposal on reunification without substantial initial German
              concessions was likely to be rejected by the Soviet Union.</note> We make no
            concession to the Russians in trying to agree among ourselves in the West. It is no
            concession for the Federal Republic to abandon what it does not have. I know of no other
            country in the world which would support the frontiers of 1937.</p>
                    <p>You may properly say that the above does not solve our present problem which arises
            from the present outbreak of recurring German malaise with which we have become all too
            familiar in the past twelve years. What would you think of telling Erhard and Schroeder,
            before <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s visit to Paris, that</p>
                    <p>(a) We are prepared to join in an initiative on reunification which is serious (i.e.:
            an initiative in which we believe ourselves as constituting a substantive approach to
            the problem, and not merely a procedural gambit undertaken for the purpose of placating
            domestic political pressures), agreed to by the Western Four and properly prepared.</p>
                    <p>(b) We believe that there is a major difficulty in Paris which calls for the fullest
            and frankest discussion between Erhard and <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName>. You might add that some of the points I made to Schroeder in Paris
                            were aimed not at him but at <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve de Murville</persName>.</p>
                    <p>I do not believe that we should undertake to obtain British and French agreement to
            something worked out between us and the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, as
            suggested in your tel 2565. We simply cannot deliver Paris and might not be able to
            deliver London. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> ought to go after
              <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> and try to find something on which
            the two of them would seek the agreement of <pb n="207" xml:id="pg_207" facs="0237"/>the
            Anglo-Saxons. A United States-<gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> agreement would bear
            the “kiss of death” in Paris.</p>
                    <p>One further word on reunification. During the past four years, I have raised German
            reunification in every serious talk I have had with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> and in my talk with <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> when I went to Moscow for the test ban signing. No other
            Western Foreign Minister or Chief of Government has raised the matter more insistently
            than have I. Upon my return from <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, I raised with
              <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> the possibility of informal Big Four
            talks about the German question, making it clear that we would expect to raise
              reunification.<note n="5" xml:id="d84fn5">See <ref target="#d78">Document
              78</ref>.</note> He rejected the suggestion out of hand. I would appreciate your
            comment on whether it would help to let it be known publicly that I took this matter up
            with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> as a result of Schroeder's
            initiative in Paris, with the agreement of the other Foreign Ministers, and with
            negative results.</p>
                    <p>I hope that my letter to Schroeder on the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>

                    <p>B. Despite the lack of Allied enthusiasm and the clear indications, known to the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, that the Sovs will not buy the idea, the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> considers the Four-Power Council concept best suited to
            meet the situation it faces. From the tenor of comments emanating from official sources,
            the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> is taking care to avoid any expectation of
            significant progress toward reunification. The general presentation is that despite
            Soviet intransigence, a committee should be proposed not for propagandistic purposes or
            in the hope of an immediate solution of the German problem, but because such a body,
            where the German question can be kept under continuing confidential study, is badly
            needed. A recurring observation is that with such a council in existence, <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> cooperation in
            humanitarian steps will be facilitated, moreover, the argument goes, even if rejected by
            the Soviets, a Western initiative will once again bring home to the world who is
            responsible for the continued division of Germany.</p>
                    <p>C. Having taken an official, publicized decision in favor of a council, the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> will now have to continue to press the Western Allies for
            their agreement. Failure would expose the Chancellor to attacks for pursuing an illusory
            goal and would raise again the whole question of the degree of support the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> can expect from its Allies.</p>
                    <p>It must be assumed that despite the setback at Paris in December, the Chancellor still
            considers it possible to gain Tripartite acceptance of an initiative of this type.</p>
                    <p>2. The Berlin Cabinet meeting has received prominent attention in German media, with
            the main focus today on the Four-Power Council <pb n="209" xml:id="pg_209" facs="0239"/>decision. The other discussions in the various committee and Fraktion meetings have
            also highlighted Berlin as the center of German politics and policy-making this week.
            Thus the government's commitment to the Allies to avoid wide publicity in connection
            with the Cabinet sessions, while honored prior to the meeting, has perhaps unavoidably
            proved of little significance since yesterday. It was just this that the British advised
            against in the prior consultation on the Cabinet meeting (Embtel 2550).<note n="4" xml:id="d85fn4">Not found.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>3. Editorial comment on the Quadripartite Council decision is so far limited to Welt,
            which views it skeptically. It comments that “if <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> really has in mind more than keeping the German question
            alive—possibly because he feels under domestic pressure—then more substantial proposals
            which provide a realistic basis for negotations are needed.” More editorial comment will
            certainly be forthcoming along this line but for the present the news coverage gives the
            impression that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, while meeting in Berlin, has
            taken a positive step in the German question.</p>

                    <p>2622. For the Secretary. I appreciate your going to such length to describe the
            background of your thinking on the reunification problem (<gloss target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss>'s 1978).<note n="2" xml:id="d87fn2">
                            <ref target="#d84">Document 84</ref>.</note> You portray very well the present
            confused situation here, which reflects in exaggerated form the normal suspicion and
            sensitivity of the Germans—derived from their basic feeling of insecurity, and lack of
            confidence in themselves and in their future. Despite the current attraction of
              <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>, every German knows that his security
            rests only on the U.S. Even the slightest doubt about our position sends them into
            endless rounds of speculation and questioning. During each major period <pb n="211" xml:id="pg_211" facs="0241"/>of upset, and I have gone through approximately six of
            them in the twenty months I have been here, every old doubt and fear is reexamined. The
            public reverberations reach a peak of intensity—and then die down and our relations
            become normal again.</p>
                    <p>I realize that this is very vexing there in Washington. It is of course to us here. The
            Germans should have more confidence in us, as I told Schroeder yesterday.<note n="3" xml:id="d87fn3">
                            <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> reported on his meeting with Schroeder
              in telegram 2610 from Bonn, January 14. (Department of State, Central Files, DEF
                (<gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>))</note> However, we are not likely to see any
            change in their basic mood. If we hope to preserve and build on our alliance with
            them—as the second most powerful nation—in many respects—in the Free World, we must
            continue to be patient with them. We must continue to try to reassure them, to avoid
            apparent abrupt changes in policy on vital matters affecting them without careful
            preparation and explanation. When we do speak, particularly in public, we should I
            believe stick close to the “boiler plate” the Germans are used to and that we know will
            work. If we have serious questions about changing the policy it describes, we should
            first take it up quietly with the government.</p>
                    <p>Your backgrounder has in many respects had a healthy effect here. Most serious
            observers are in agreement with the basic points you made. There have been many
            favorable reactions in the German press. Most responsible people appear to accept the
            proposition that any new reunification proposal should be carefully thought out, and
            that certain agreed positions should be reached in advance. Indeed, Schroeder is
            embarrassed that he is being portrayed as proposing initiatives that are not
            serious.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the question of borders, you may be interested to know that Fritz Erler
            is reported in today's press as saying that Germany should discuss the Oder-Neisse
            border immediately with Poland. I myself have long been concerned at the German attitude
            toward borders, which I think is the one most disturbing subject of discussion here. I
            agree that the time may very easily come when we should speak out. I would not be
            willing, for example, to continue supporting an irridentist Germany. I would not be
            willing to see the 7th Army used as a pawn for Mr. Seebohm to take the Sudetenland. His
            formula of Heimatrecht plus self-determination is sheer aggression. If things get worse
            I think we might first threaten and then, if it continues, later publicly disassociate
            ourselves from any German hope of territorial gain.</p>
                    <p>It was not my intention in Embtel 2565<note n="4" xml:id="d87fn4">See <ref target="#d83fn7">footnote 7, Document 83</ref> and <ref target="#d87fn2">footnotes
                2</ref> and <ref target="#d84fn4">4, Document 84</ref>.</note> to suggest that we
            work out something with the Germans on a reunification initiative following which we
            would obtain British-French agreement. What I intended to say was merely that we would
            be willing to sit down in a Four-Power <pb n="212" xml:id="pg_212" facs="0242"/>meeting
            to attempt to work something out, i.e., as we do through the Ambassadorial Group.</p>
                    <p>I am quite in agreement with your proposals (A) and (B) as to what we should tell
              <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> and Schroeder before <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s visit to Paris. I would appreciate it,
            however, if you would confirm by immediate return telegram<note n="5" xml:id="d87fn5">Instructions for <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName>'s discussion with

            Schroeder, even though it is essentially a procedural proposal. Would your requirements
            for substance be met if the Four Powers could agree in advance of the proposal as to all
            of the variables which would be involved in the proposal itself, and at least the first
            and second round of questions the Soviets might put to the British, French and ourselves
            in the event the proposal were accepted, without necessarily bringing up to date a
            comprehensive substantive proposal such as the <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> Plan?<note n="6" xml:id="d87fn6">Reference is to the Western Peace

                    </p>
                    <p>I see no objection why you should not let it be known that you took reunification up

            results. Schroeder has been briefing the German Foreign Affairs Committee and the
            Cabinet here, using material from your meeting with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> which we have supplied him with <gloss target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss> approval. This fact has become known in the press. If you do not
            consider that it might tend to dry <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> up on
            the subject in future discussions with you, I believe it would be very healthy for you
            to see that this fact gets into the public domain.</p>

                    <p>2651. For the President. I hope you will read our Embassy telegram 2643<note n="2" xml:id="d88fn2">For text, see <ref target="frus1964-68v13#d69">
                                <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1964–1968, vol. XIII, Document
              69</ref>.</note> describing my meeting last evening with Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> on the eve of his visit with General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> at Rambouillet. I believe that this message
            will reassure you as to the state of our relations with the Chancellor and the German
            Government. The closing statement of the telegram quotes <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s assurances to you that “nothing in the German position has
            changed,” that he “values his personal friendship with you,” and that Germany would like
            to consider itself “our most faithful ally”—all of which I am convinced he meant in
            great sincerity.</p>
                    <p>I hope, therefore, that you will not allow the tempest which has been raging in German
            political and newspaper circles during the last two weeks to raise any questions as to
              <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s constancy and faithfulness. The
            atmosphere here is the worst I have encountered during my stay here of almost two years.
            It was set in motion by events emanating from the US, which led to a genuine
            misunderstanding of the US intention 1) to proceed with the creation of an <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> and 2) to support Germany in a reunification initiative.
            I see from the reports of my colleagues that this was not an exclusively German reaction
            but was widespread in Europe—and I believe even in the US.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s reaction to the change in our pace
            following the National Security Memorandum of Dec 17 was, as I predicted to you in
            Johnson City, to seek a delay in obtaining official Bundestag approval for the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> until after the German elections next September. Although
            this is embarrassing to Schroeder and does to some extent play into the hands of the
            Gaullists here, it is warmly welcomed by the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> party
            leadership as removing a source of tension between Germany and France during the
            electoral period. I assume that this is not, moreover, an entirely unwelcome development
            from our standpoint.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">McGeorge Bundy</persName> has in your behalf advised me of
            your reaction to the recent German nervousness, and of the fact that you do not “find it
            agreeable to have repeatedly renewed German questions about the firmness of (your)
            purpose or the direction of (your) policy.” I can understand a reaction to the recent
            German mood. Indeed, during these periodic flurries the Germans behave in a very
            irrational and immature way. This <pb n="214" xml:id="pg_214" facs="0244"/>is, however,
            their present nature, derived from their basic insecurity and lack of confidence in
            themselves and their future. Since we are not likely to change them, and since Germany
            is so important to us as an ally, we must I believe be patient and wait them out.
            Usually, as in this case, the tide again turns. Fortunately, I believe that we now face
            the Rambouillet meeting with a decided upswing in our favor.</p>
                    <p>In any event I very much hope that you have not obtained from my reporting the
            impression that <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> himself has not been
            constant. His position was deeply affected by the popular mood which prevailed here;
            however, he himself did not yield to it and he has now emerged, I believe, master of the
            situation here and, as ever, a faithful friend of yours and ally of the US.</p>

                    <p>Dear Mr. Secretary:</p>
                    <p>You will have seen our 2643<note n="2" xml:id="d89fn2">For text, see <ref target="frus1964-68v13#d69">
                                <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1964–1968, vol. XIII, Document
              69</ref>.</note> dealing with my meeting on January 15 with Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>. I hope that you found the results of this
            meeting to your satisfaction, also how the question of a reunification initiative was
            handled following my telephone discussion with <persName>Bill Tyler</persName> prior to
            the meeting. I subsequently received your 1989<note n="3" xml:id="d89fn3">Not
              found.</note> which, I believe, reflects some misunderstanding of what I had in mind.
            I did not in my 2622<note n="4" xml:id="d89fn4">
                            <ref target="#d87">Document 87</ref>.</note> intend to suggest that we give an answer
            to the Germans on any proposal by ourselves—any more than I had in my 2565<note n="5" xml:id="d89fn5">See <ref target="#d83fn7">footnote 7, Document 83</ref> and <ref target="#d89fn2">footnotes 2</ref> and <ref target="#d84fn4">4, Document
              84</ref>.</note> to which it referred. Indeed, in 2622 I stated quite the opposite.
            “It was not my intention in the Embtel to suggest that we work out something with the
            Germans on a reunification initiative following which we would obtain British French <pb n="215" xml:id="pg_215" facs="0245"/>agreement. What I intended to say was merely that
            we would be willing to sit down in a Four Power meeting to attempt to work something
            out, i.e., as we do through the Ambassadorial Group.”</p>
                    <p>My position with the Germans on this question since my return has been entirely based
            on what you had agreed to in Paris, i.e., to be willing to consider the German Four
            Power Council proposal on a US–<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>-French-German basis. I
            assume that we still are prepared to do this and was in my 2622 merely trying to clarify
            a question raised in paragraph A of <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 1978,<note n="6" xml:id="d89fn6">
                            <ref target="#d84">Document 84</ref>.</note> merely that we were prepared to join only
            in an initiative “constituting a substantive approach.” The Four Power Council concept
            is not in reality a substantive approach. This is the latest proposal that the Germans
            have put forward and one that we agreed in Paris that we would be willing to consider in
            a meeting of the Four (France, US, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>). Although I did not even commit us to this in my meeting
            with <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>, I would appreciate it if the point
            could be further clarified.</p>
                    <p>As to the general question as to whether we should support a German initiative at all,
            I still feel strongly along the lines of Embtel 2565 that we should. Many observers have
            been saying this—<persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName> among others for
            over a year. This assumes, as I am convinced, that the Germans are, following your
            backgrounder, now prepared to come to grips with the substantive issues concerned and
            help work out agreed positions. A Four Power Council proposal would not, on the surface,
            appear to require answers to all issues that would ultimately be raised. I hope that if
            we do agree to this, that we can do so with sufficiently good grace to permit us to get
            some credit. Up to this point, although we seem ultimately willing to consider a German
            proposal, the impression we give is that we do so very reluctantly.</p>
                    <p>I am convinced that the Germans are entitled to an initiative—that one is overdue
            whether this is an election year or not. If a man is sitting on you, you have every
            right to ask him occasionally to get off. I think that even if it is turned down by the
            Russians, that we have the right—indeed the obligation—to continue to point out to the
            world, the monstrosity in the 20th century of keeping 18 million people in neo-colonial
            bondage. I have personally never accepted the argument to the effect that the asking for
            an initiative would trip off another Berlin crisis. That is not what tripped off the
            last one. The Russians appear to want to keep the situation normal in Berlin. If we
            restrain ourselves in raising with the Soviets questions just because we fear an
            aggressive reaction, there will be little dialogue between us. The theory that we must
            stick rigidly to the status quo on the German and Berlin question or else the Russians
            will make things bad for us, does not give adequate consideration to the dynamics of the
              <pb n="216" xml:id="pg_216" facs="0246"/>German people today. They are not content to
            sit still and will not. The question is whether these energies are vented through
            constructive action or by means which would disrupt the existing balance.</p>
                    <p>I know that the Germans can be very irritating at times in their excitability,
            indecisiveness and constant need for reassurance. But unlike the French under President
              <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>, their basic policies in Western
            Europe continue to be along lines consistent with our own broad objectives. To keep them
            moving in this direction, we may sometimes have to accept their lead in making public
            gestures which alone we would find useless or even undesirable.</p>

            discussions with General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> at Rambouillet

            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>.<note n="3" xml:id="d90fn3">Attachment to <ref target="#d67">Document 67</ref>.</note>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> had before him in German translation
            what was presumably a copy of this memorandum, which had just been called to his
            attention, dated August [garble], 1964. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>
            did not raise the question, nor did I, as to whether or not the memorandum had been
            requested. He did ask, however, in what capacity Brandt had written it and what status
            it had vis-à-vis the US Government.</p>
                    <p>I replied that it was my understanding that Brandt had, during his last visit to
            America, volunteered certain views during his meeting with <pb n="217" xml:id="pg_217" facs="0247"/>the Secretary with regard to a policy for Eastern Europe—which he had
            followed up with a written memorandum. I did not know in what capacity he wrote it. The
            Secretary and other high American officials, of course, receive as visitors opposition
            leaders from many countries, and are willing to listen to what they say and read
            memoranda they submit. This did not however, mean that the proposal made by Brandt had
            any official inter-governmental status between the US and Germany. We understand full
            well that this subject is beyond Brandt's competence as GovMayor of Berlin, and we would
            discuss such a matter in an authoritative way only with the Federal Government. The
            Chancellor asked me if I had any objection to his quoting what I had said. I replied
            that I did not.</p>
                    <p>I then advised the Chancellor of the recent démarche made to the Embassy by a
            representative of another party in Germany (although I did not say so, he understood
            that it was the <gloss target="#t_FDP1">FDP</gloss> since their proposal has become
            known publicly) who wished to send a delegation to our country to discuss a further
            reunification initiative.<note n="4" xml:id="d90fn4">Reported in telegram 2710 from
              Bonn, January 20. (Department of State, Central Files, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 32–4 <gloss target="#t_GER1">GER</gloss>)</note> I had advised them
            that although we would receive their delegation at a suitable level and listen to what
            they had to say, we would not undertake to discuss with them authoritatively or
            negotiate with them concerning a reunification initiative. This, again, was a matter in
            which we could deal only with the Federal Government or its designated representatives.
            I had given the party in question no assurances that their delegation would be received
            by the President—indeed, I had attempted to discourage them from going at all.</p>

              (Ibid.)</note> While we are aware that fuss and feathers in Bundestag on the issue of
            Brandt's memorandum represents largely domestic political in-fighting, there is
            nevertheless a question of principle involved which should be upheld. Pending final
            solution of the German problem, the three Western Powers retain certain clear and
            onerous responsibilities with regard to Berlin and to Germany as a whole, which place
            them in a special position. The US Government cannot accept the thesis, either
            explicitly stated or implied, that it may not receive the views of a Berlin official on
            matters relating to matters of common interest. Obviously the US Government has not and

            them with Amb <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> during my recent visit to
            Washington. If necessary in order to obtain a change in existing policy I recommend that
            you talk about this matter with Sec <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
            personally.</p>
                    <p>I strongly recommend this because I consider these flights provocative—indeed, the only
            really provocative thing we now do in Berlin. It is quite clear that this type of flight
            was never envisaged under the original agreements. The flights have nothing to do with
            the maintenance of freedom of air access to Berlin in general, which is done hourly by
            commercial overflights. Their intelligence function is of course obvious to the Soviets.
            They do not in my opinion represent a show of strength or determination on our part,
            indeed quite the reverse, since we carefully gauge the flights on a hit-and-run basis to
            get out before the Soviets can locate them. The Soviets have given ample evidence that
            they consider them objectionable. They consistently vector fighters to find them and
            have threatened to “take care of them.” If these fighters do find them and precipitate
            an incident, either by attempting to buzz them out or shoot them down, we would be faced
            with the very difficult question of whether or not to abandon the flights in the face of
            force. I have looked into the matter carefully and am convinced that the intelligence
            gained is very meager and by no means worth the risks involved.</p>
                    <p>I frankly would be in favor of abandoning the flights altogether. However, if we want
            to maintain some theoretical right of helicopter <pb n="220" xml:id="pg_220" facs="0250"/>flights, which we did not, apparently, consider worthwhile until the Wall, I recommend
            that we send a flight over very infrequently, say every six months to a year, over some
            non-sensitive area, rather than over prime intelligence targets as at present.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Dear Mr. President:</p>
                    <p>In your address on the occasion of your inauguration to the high office of President of
                            the United States,<note n="2" xml:id="d93fn2">For text, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the
              Presidents of the United States: <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B.
                Johnson</persName>, 1965</hi>, Book I, pp. 71–74.</note> you have described the great
            tasks which confront your country in the interest of maintaining peace and freedom in
            the world and you have stressed the heavy burdens which your country is prepared to
            carry toward that end. That you may be granted to come closer to these high aims through
            a successful policy which serves peace is my sincere and cordial wish for your new term
            of office. On the occasion of your solemn inauguration you have expressed your desire to
            cooperate and to stand together with the free peoples. I am happy to be able to tell you
            that it is my firm conviction that my discussions in Rambouillet have also been useful
            in the sense of furthering the political unity of Europe, but also with regard to a
            close cooperation with the United States in the framework of the Western Alliance.</p>
                    <p>I have already informed your Ambassador about the course of my discussions with
            President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>.<note n="3" xml:id="d93fn3">See <ref target="#d90fn2">footnote 2, Document 90</ref>.</note> I have received the
            impression that we are well on our way to reestablish a firmer basis for the vital
            questions of the Western Alliance.</p>
                    <p>It gave me particular satisfaction to note the very positive remarks of the French
            President with regard to the reunification of Germany and the readiness of the French
            Government to discuss the German problem <pb n="221" xml:id="pg_221" facs="0251"/>on the
            level of the Western Powers together with the Federal Republic and to examine if and in
            what way the Soviet Union might be prepared to find on a Four Power basis progress or
            solutions in all questions concerning divided Germany.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> concurred with me in
            recognizing that the preservation of peace and the protection of Europe cannot be
            guaranteed without the immense military potential of your country. France, he said, was
            adhering to the alliance with the United States and was faithfully supporting the
            Western Alliance. I noted these very remarks with particular satisfaction.</p>
                    <p>As far as the European questions in particular are concerned, the consent of the French
            President to preparing until summer of this year a conference of Heads of States and
            Governments of the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>-countries is certainly a good
            beginning in the direction of a political unification of Europe.</p>
                    <p>I very much hope that your plans to come to Europe in the near future will soon take
            shape and I am sincerely looking forward to the opportunity then to continue our
            exchange of views on the most important political questions. A renewed greater clarity,
            certainty and consent in all questions of common policy of the Western world seem to me
            highly desirable if not indispensable in the interest of peace.</p>
                    <p>With my good wishes for a very early and complete recovery of your health, I combine my
            cordial greetings and respectful regards for Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>.</p>
                    <p>m.p.: In friendship,</p>
                    <p>sincerely yours,</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>After mutual introductory compliments, the Ambassador referred to the Chancellor's most
            recent letter to the President.<note n="2" xml:id="d94fn2">
                            <ref target="#d93">Document 93</ref>.</note> The Ambassador said that the letter was
            in a sense in response to the President's oral message conveyed through the Ambassador
            some weeks ago at the time when certain other Ambassadors were presenting their
            credentials (see attachment).<note n="3" xml:id="d94fn3">Not printed. According to the
              memorandum of conversation of this discussion, the President told Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName> that he would keep <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> fully informed of any conversations he had
              regarding Germany and stressed the need for the two nations to work in concert.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>The Ambassador said that he was under instructions to amplify the Chancellor's letter
            in the following respects:</p>
                    <p>(1) <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>'s statements on international
            monetary affairs in his February 4 press conference<note n="4" xml:id="d94fn4">For text,
              see <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">Charles de Gaulle</persName>, Discours et Messages,
              vol. 4, pp. 325–342.</note> had been made without prior consultation with or the
            knowledge of the Federal Republic of Germany. The Ambassador said that his government
            felt strongly that the United States and the United Kingdom must participate in any
            discussions on international monetary matters.</p>
                    <p>(2) The Ambassador said that he was under instructions to bring to the President's
            attention a certain growing concern in Germany with regard to increasing United States
            capital investments. The German government was not at all opposed to US investments in
            Germany which were beneficial to the industrial and economic health of the country.
            However if investments increased beyond a certain point, a situation could arise in
            which German offset military purchases became in fact a form of partial financing the
            deficit caused by massive exports of capital into Germany by the United States. For this
            reason, the German government <pb n="223" xml:id="pg_223" facs="0253"/>hopes that
            further measures could now be taken to reduce the volume of US private capital exports.
            The Ambassador then cited the figures of $4.3 billion in 1963 and $3.9 billion in 1964
            for US export of capital. He also mentioned the sum of $1 billion as the price paid by
            the US Ford Company when it bought up the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Ford
            Company.</p>
                    <p>(3) With regard to German reunification the Ambassador said that his government was
            most grateful for the President's Georgetown speech in December and for his State of the
            Union message as well as for subsequent statements by the State Department in support of
            reunification. It was gratified that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>
            had “at last” come around to supporting discussions on ways of moving toward an
            initiative in reunification. At this point the President asked whether <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> really wanted to go it alone as seemed to be
            the case from what he had said on February 4. The Ambassador stated with emphasis that
            Germany considered reunification to be a Four Power question, at least at this stage and
            for the foreseeable future, and felt strongly that a US role was indispensable. The
            President said that if Germany and other Europeans want to discuss reunification by
            themselves, this was something that he would not have difficulty with. He said he had a
            close feeling for Chancellor Erhard and valued the US-German relationship, but he didn't
            want this to stand in the way of progress toward reunification if Germany thought it
            could be better discussed independently of the United States. The Ambassador referred to
            a statement issued by the French government after <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName>'s press conference clarifying what <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName> had said so as not to exclude a role by the United States. He said
            that this French statement had been made as a result of the strong German feeling on the
            subject which had been conveyed to the French government. He said that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> is now willing to participate in Four Power
            talks and that this was a success for <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>.</p>
                    <p>(4) The Ambassador summarized certain aspects of the talks at Rambouillet between
              <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> and the Chancellor on the nuclear
            question. He said that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> envisaged
            Germany's role as being limited to participating in planning of strategic nuclear
            targeting. The Ambassador stated emphatically that his government considered an Atlantic
            nuclear force to be necessary in order to prevent the gap between nuclear and
            non-nuclear powers from increasing to the point where it would create grave
            psychological and political difficulties. He said he wished to tell the President
            frankly that some people in Germany had felt last December that the United States
            Government had gone too far in apparently dissociating itself from a commitment to move
            forward toward an Atlantic nuclear organization. Even if the United States Government
            felt that it had been exerting too much pressure before this, the fact remained that the
            impression now was in Germany that the United States had moved too far in the opposite
            direction.</p>
                    <pb n="224" xml:id="pg_224" facs="0254"/>
                    <p>The President said that when Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> and he had talked,<note n="5" xml:id="d94fn5">Records of these
              discussions, held in December 1964, are in <ref target="frus1964-68v13#d58">
                                <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1964–1968, vol. XIII, Documents
                58</ref>-<ref target="frus1964-68v13#d61">61</ref>.</note> the Prime Minister had
            questioned just how strongly any European government was in favor of moving toward an
            Atlantic nuclear force. The Prime Minister seemed to feel that such favorable views as
            had been expressed in Europe had been colored by US insistence. The President said that
            we didn't agree with the British assessment on this, and suggested that they take the
            matter up themselves and talk with the Germans and Italians and other countries, and
            that they would find that those countries would say the same things to the British as
            they had said to us. Then the British could come back to us after they had concluded
            their discussions and we could all move forward together again. The President said that
            we had told the British that an Atlantic nuclear force was the best means we knew to
            relieve the British of their national nuclear burden. It was likely that with a small
            majority and certain other pressing problems, the British Government might be glad to
            find a solution to their nuclear difficulties. We had suggested that they undertake
            these talks and then we could discuss the whole thing further. The President said that
            our position represented no advancement and no retreat from the position we had
            previously taken.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador said that nevertheless the December memorandum<note n="6" xml:id="d94fn6">Reference is to <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> No. 322,
              December 17, 1964, <ref target="frus1964-68v13#d65">
                                <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1964–1968, vol. XIII, Document
              65</ref>.</note> had been widely misinterpreted as reflecting far-reaching
            disaffection by the United States.</p>
                    <p>The President said the important thing was for the British, the Germans and the
            Italians to get together, rather than that we should appear to be telling our European
            friends what they should be thinking. The quicker they brought their positions closer to
            each other the easier it would be for us to move ahead with them.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion the Secretary asked the Embassy to tell the Chancellor that he
            appreciated the Chancellor's letter. He said he was happy with the relationship which
            existed between them. He wanted the Chancellor to feel that he had the support of the
            United States government for efforts to make progress toward reunification. He said we
            were ready to participate in discussions whenever our responsible allies were. The
            President said he was pleased that de Gaulle and Erhard were in agreement on further
            moves in the field of European unity. He said that he looked forward to full exchange of
            views with the Chancellor when he goes over to Europe.</p>
                    <p>Finally the President and the Ambassador agreed on what the Ambassador should tell the
            press about their conversation. Subsequently <pb n="225" xml:id="pg_225" facs="0255"/>the following statement on the visit by the Ambassador was issued by the White
            House:</p>
                    <p>“Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName> and I have had a good talk
            this morning. He delivered a message from Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> which reaffirmed the deep community of interest between the Federal
            Republic and the United States. I told the Ambassador of the full and continuing support
            of the United States for serious progress toward the reunification of Germany, and I
            expressed my clear agreement with Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> that the struggle for the reunification of Germany requires the
            interest and active participation of all of the responsible powers.”</p>

                    <p>The Secretary asked what French views were on the German reunification question since
            the <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName> talks at Rambouillet and the press conference of President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>.</p>
                    <pb n="226" xml:id="pg_226" facs="0256"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve de Murville</persName> referred to the Rambouillet
            meeting, saying that as <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> had pointed
            out, in the long run the resolution of the German question was the resolution of the
            European question ending in European unity. If the Iron Curtain disappears, then Germany
            too may be reunited. The Germans, according to <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName>, were pleased to be told that their problem was a European one. They
            realized that German reunification was a long process, but had asked what would be done
            to give the impression that the West was not disinterested. The Germans had left the
            impression that it was better to be turned down on an initiative than to make no effort
            at all. <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> said Schroeder had asked him what
            would be the best procedure for getting another initiative underway and had asked about
            the advisability of using the Ambassadorial Group. <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> had told Schroeder he thought this would be useful. An alternative
            suggestion made by <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> to Schroeder was to meet
            in Bonn. <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> preferred Washington because the
            Ambassadorial Group was accustomed to dealing with the subject, and would not be as
            exposed to the German press.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary stated our preference for the Washington Ambassadorial Group.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> had suggested a meeting of the Foreign Ministers, but this had not
            been followed up by Schroeder. He added that he thought the Germans would have to take
            the initiative, and pointed out that thus far nothing had happened.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary confirmed that we had received no communication from Schroeder requesting
            a meeting.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> raised a question whether we should do
            something or wait for the Germans to act.</p>
                    <p>The consensus seemed to be that we would wait for the Germans to ask for a meeting.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said we were ready to join in some sort of German initiative.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> asked if this meant saying something to the
            Soviets.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said if we agree to an initiative, we should all recognize that there may
            be consequences flowing from it which we would have to take into account. We cannot
            count forever on the raising of an initiative on Thursday, a Soviet rejection on Friday,
            and forgetting all about it on Saturday. He asked what the consequences would be if the
            Soviets bring up the status of Berlin. He wanted to be sure that in case of a Soviet
            reaction to discuss, we would be all together. He pointed to the possibility of a fresh
            crisis arising out of a German initiative. He added that he doubted such a crisis would
            arise, but wished to be sure everyone was aware of the possibility. He said he gained
            the impression that the Germans wished to talk about reunification, but that was about
            all. The Secretary continued, saying that we agreed with the French that the German <pb n="227" xml:id="pg_227" facs="0257"/>question must be resolved in terms of resolving
            European problems. He did not expect any dramatic development. He did not think anyone
            wanted to fight a war over German reunification. The real problem, the Secretary said,
            is what can we do in the face of real and understandable German requirements.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> asked whether the Secretary agreed with the
            French that the only real solution lay in the opening of Eastern Europe. The real
            problem, as he saw it, was to isolate the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> in Eastern
            Europe, place it where it would have no relations with the West.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary agreed. He added that he sometimes contemplated the report that Malenkov
            and Beria in 1955 had been prepared to do something about Germany.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCE2">Bohlen</persName> thought Malenkov would have
            been favorably disposed toward Germany.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that Malenkov and Beria had even raised this thought, gave
            plausibility to the possibility that some day there might be a combination of German
            arrangements, disarmament and trade to warrant the Soviet Union going along with a
            united Germany.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCE2">Bohlen</persName> thought the evolution toward
            this end might be speeded up somewhat if an island of Stalinism in the form of the
              <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> finally became unacceptable to the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked whether the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> would not become
            more important to the Russians if the Soviets pulled back their twenty-two divisions out
            of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. The Secretary said he had tried to explain
            to our people why we treat the Eastern European countries differently from the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. He said this has compelled us to say things at times
            which were unpleasant to the Soviets. He referred to a speech which he had made that had
            had that effect. He concluded, however, that the Soviets have apparently not objected
            too much to our Eastern European policies.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> made allowance for the possibility,
            however, that the Soviets did view our efforts as divisive.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary spoke of the extraordinary changes which had occurred in Eastern
            Europe.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> agreed and pointed out that of course the
            Eastern Europeans were not all Slavs and also economically don't rely on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> also
            referred to the Hungarian Peter as a “nice Calvinist Bishop”.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary thought it important to continue to improve our relations with Eastern
            Europe. In this regard, he said we were studying carefully with Congress our regulations
            and laws governing trade with Eastern Europe.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> pointed out that the US had never had
            much trade with the Eastern European countries. More of this had traditionally taken
            place with Western Europe.</p>
                    <pb n="228" xml:id="pg_228" facs="0258"/>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> referred to the efforts of
            Berthold Beitz to develop cooperative German-Polish enterprises.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> mentioned the growing tourism to Eastern
            Europe. The Secretary saw possibilities for greater tourism to Eastern Europe from the
            US. All agreed that this was an important element in developing better relations.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked again if the French were prepared to support a German initiative in
            the Ambassadorial Group? <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> answered in the
            affirmative and thought the British would do so also.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said it was his impression the British would go along, but he had not yet
            talked to the new British Foreign Secretary about this.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> asked if we waited for the
            Germans to make the initiative?</p>
                    <p>The Secretary and Ambassador Thompson answered in the affirmative.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador Alphand inquired whether we mentioned to the Germans the possible
            consequences of an initiative.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> thought that this would
            depend upon the kind of initiative suggested by the Germans.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> mentioned the need of the Chancellor
            to do something before the German elections.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> saw two choices as to the
            type of initiative raised by the Germans. The first, which would be turned down
            immediately by the Soviets, would call for free elections. The second might be some
            interim step like the setting up of humanitarian commissions.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary related how he had after the December talks in Paris raised with
              <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> in a most tentative way the possibility
            of German unification. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, according to the
            Secretary, turned out to be a good Western politician. He said that there was no chance
            of the reunification of Germany at this time, and that he did not see what the Soviet
            Union had to gain in making it possible for <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> to
            create the impression that it was making progress in this field. The Secretary added
            that he would have to point out to the President that there always existed as a result
            of any conference with the Russians on a German initiative the possibility of a renewal
            of the 1958 and 1961 crises which cost us so much money and time. The Secretary wanted
            to be sure that we would be together if this happened, and that he would not feel so
            lonely as he had so often in the past.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> said that the Soviets would try to find a
            solution which would give no satisfaction to the Germans.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> when the British were
            going to Paris.<note n="2" xml:id="d95fn2">April 2–3.</note>
                    </p>
                    <pb n="229" xml:id="pg_229" facs="0259"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> replied that although the date had not been
            fixed, it could well be April 1.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> asked if there were any possibility of
            doing something on May 8, the 20th anniversary of V–E Day.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCE2">Bohlen</persName> thought that this was a rather
            tricky problem.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> asked whether the Russians had said
            anything about May 8. The answer was “no”. <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName>
            thought the Russians would be delighted to do something with us, which would be
            unpleasant for the Germans.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary saw no great profit in doing something with the anniversary. Mr.
              <persName corresp="#p_TWR2">Tyler</persName> suggested that much attention would be
            paid to the date on a worldwide basis and that the Russians should not be allowed to
            hold the center of the stage.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked whether the Russians had made any suggestions to Paris. <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> replied in the negative.</p>

                    <p>At our luncheon today I drew <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve de Murville</persName>
            aside and commented quite specifically about President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName>'s reference in his recent press conference to his view that the
            question of German reunification is a “European question”. I pointed out that the United
            States has a deep and vital interest in that issue, that our interest in it stemmed from
            World War II, and that I would like to know from <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve de Murville</persName> whether President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
            Gaulle</persName>'s remark implied any diminution of the American role as an essential
            participant in all matters affecting German reunification and Berlin. He stated
            categorically that no such implication was present or was intended, that France fully
            recognizes the United States role in the settlement of such matters.</p>

                    <p>After an exchange of cordial amenities, the President said that he liked the German
            Chancellor very much. He said that he had enjoyed two visits with him, and that he had
            enjoyed no other visit with any other foreign statesman more than that of Chancellor
              <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>. He added that he liked the
            Chancellor's flexibility, vision and fairness. He thought that never in our history were
            the American people more interested in Germany, or liked the Germans more than they do
            today.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Barzel said he was glad to hear that. He realized that there were some problems. He
            said that he had called Bonn today and had found out that one of these problems, the
            extension of the statute of limitations for Nazi crimes, would be decided favorably. Dr.
            Barzel also said that he was glad that Ambassador Harriman had gone to Israel,<note n="2" xml:id="d97fn2"> Harriman visited Israel February 23.</note> and that the
            Federal Republic would be grateful for any help he could give them there.</p>
                    <p>The President said that he was very pleased with what the Chancellor had done in
            connection with Israel.<note n="3" xml:id="d97fn3">Reference is to <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s February 17 statement to the Bundestag on

                Current Documents, 1965</hi>, pp. 479–481.</note> He said he was sorry that there
            had been a bit of flare-up after both sides had agreed to a “no comment” on the arms
            deal with Israel. The President felt that it was unfortunate that not all elements of
            the German Government were apparently together on this. He thought that the <persName corresp="#p_HKG1">Von Hase</persName> statement had not been very helpful. But, the
            President added, his admiration for Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> far outweighed any lapses from good teamwork.</p>
                    <pb n="231" xml:id="pg_231" facs="0261"/>
                    <p>The President said he had told Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> during his last visit that as long as he was President, when
            America would make any move of significance, Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> would know as soon as he would. The President said that this is why
            he sent a special emissary to inform the Chancellor of the decisions reached during the
            visit of Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName>.</p>
                    <p>The President said that on the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> question, the
            British had come here after a tough election and forming a government with a small
            majority. They had raised the question whether the Germans were speaking their own
            minds, or saying what we wanted them to say. The President said that he had told the
            British that the Germans were able and eloquent spokesmen and did not need us to speak
            for them. He had suggested to the British that they discuss this issue with the Germans
            themselves. Since that time he had learned from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> that the question could probably not be settled before the German
            elections. Since that was the case, it would be better to have British-German talks. The
            President said that he felt strongly about this matter. The President went on to say
            that as for US troops in Europe, while we might not need every soldier over there, there
            was no doubt that so long as the Chancellor and the Germans felt they needed us, we
            would be willing to stay.</p>
                    <p>The President repeated his admiration for Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>, saying that he found him to be a very understanding man, who got
            along well with Americans. He said that he knew that the Chancellor was under criticism
            at home, adding that he had experienced that himself. He said that no doubt as long as
              <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> was Chancellor, we would form a good
            team.</p>
                    <p>The President said that he had heard good things about Dr. Barzel too and his future.
            He said we needed young men to take place of those that are getting older.</p>
                    <p>The President next said that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> Ambassador had our
            complete admiration, respect and friendship. The President was sorry that Dr. Barzel
            could not come later when the President would have invited him to the Ranch. The
            President spoke of his personal interest in Germany, his training in German through the
            third grade, and the fact that when one picked up the party line at the Ranch, one heard
            more German than English. The President told Dr. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> to tell his people in truth that whatever we do will be done
            together, that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> had his complete
            confidence and Germany has our absolute and unequivocal support, that we would do all
            that is humanly possible to bring about the reunification of Germany. He repeated that
            he never thought it was necessary to have all of our troops there, but since the Germans
            wanted them, we would keep them there. He expressed pleasure over the fact that the
            Chancellor did not require much time to explain this need to his people. He said that we
            wanted to see the German nation advance and continue <pb n="232" xml:id="pg_232" facs="0262"/>its recovery. The President in turn expressed his appreciation for German
            help with the offset.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Barzel stated that he was very happy to hear the President's remarks. He was
            pleased at this indication of our friendship, something the young generation also had
            very much at heart. He said he would not take the President's time to discuss the German
            question—that he would take this up with the Secretary of State and his officials—but
            that he had one question. He said that it had occurred to him after reading the
            President's State of the Union message, why don't we develop the idea of the Great
            Society not just for the US, but for the entire free world. He thought it was a great
            idea which could find application in its various aspects (vocational education, inland
            waterways, housing, town planning, agriculture, structural problems) in other countries
            of the free world. He said he was not thinking of more aid from the US, but rather of a
            mutual exchange of experiences, from which we all could learn. Dr. Barzel thought that
            this would show the future was with the free world and not the Communist world. Such
            cooperation would also help dispel some of the dangers inherent in ideas stemming from
            the 17th and 18th Centuries.</p>
                    <p>The President expressed agreement. He pointed out that in some sectors we were already
            doing something like that. He mentioned in this connection the Alliance for Progress in
            this hemisphere as well as recent conversations some of our Senators had with officials
            of Mexico about health problems, cancer, heart, stroke and high blood pressure. He
            thought that perhaps we ought to have more of this sort of exchange with the Germans
            too. It might be a good idea, the President thought, that certain Bundestag members
            could meet here with our own Congressmen to discuss such exchanges.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador said that the Germans had a great deal of experience which they would be
            willing to make available.</p>
                    <p>The President said he would talk to leaders here about this next Tuesday. Perhaps some
            sort of meeting could be arranged with twenty-five on each side, possibly meeting one
            year in Germany and the next in the US at some resort.</p>
                    <p>The President autographed a photograph of himself and gave it to Dr. Barzel.</p>

                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Lonely and Unfairly Treated</hi>. If the object of U.S. policy is
            to make Germans feel closely bound to the West and fairly treated, events have conspired
            to produce at this time a rather extreme version of the opposite. In twenty years of
            following the cycles of German sentiment, I do not recall as acute and generally felt a
            trough as that I found in a week of intensive contacts in Bonn, Frankfurt, Freiburg, and
              Rheinhartshausen.<note n="2" xml:id="d98fn2"> Rostow reported on his discussions with
              German leaders in telegram 3474 from Bonn, March 14. (Ibid.)</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>This mood arises from a convergence of specific frustrations, large and small, from
            many directions over recent months:</p>
                    <p>—The simultaneous Israeli pressure on three fronts: military equipment, restitution,
            and the extension of the statute of limitations on war criminals, plus, of course, the
            confusions and burdens of the hasty German decision to recognize Israel.</p>
                    <p>—The threatened Arab rupture of the Hallstein Doctrine plus the burning of German
            embassies, which is not taken with the sang-froid which we and the British have
            developed.</p>
                    <p>—The (recently somewhat corrected) sense that the U.S. got them into trouble in the
            Middle East and then stood back.</p>
                    <p>—The Danish protest against the appearance in Denmark of German soldiers on joint
            maneuvers.</p>
                    <p>—The threatened removal of the German Peace Corps from Tanzania (now probably in
              hand).<note n="3" xml:id="d98fn3">All German assistance was withdrawn following
              Tanzania's recognition of the German Democratic Republic in February 1964.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>—The feeling that, in the face of the Wall and recent economic improvements, a kind of
            local identity and pride may be developing in the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>—What appears outside the government as a U.S. dumping of the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> in the face of British, French, and Russian pressures—to some extent
            shared in the government even by those relieved that they don't have to face a
            confrontation with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> before the
            election.</p>
                    <pb n="234" xml:id="pg_234" facs="0264"/>
                    <p>—A more general sense that the domestic interests of the U.S., combined with our
            Southeast Asia problem, have made us draw back from Europe in general and the German
            unity problem in particular.</p>
                    <p>—The hardening policy of Moscow on Germany since <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>'s departure from power and a bafflement as to how to mount a
            national German unity policy in either the short run (a pre-election gesture) or in the
            long run.</p>
                    <p>—A consciousness that even the most promising recent development—a European
            agricultural policy—was bought at a high cost to Germany in order to limit one—but only
            one—element in <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>'s blackmail and veto
            leverage over Germany; that is, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>'s
            threat to break up the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>.<note n="4" xml:id="d98fn4">Reference is to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>'s accusations that
              the Commission presidency was exceeding its powers.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>All this is compounded by a sense that <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s leadership is infirm.</p>
                    <p>The upshot is a feeling I can only describe as follows: Here it is a generation after
            the war; everything we try to do on the world scene fails; and it fails because others
            exploit systematically our war guilt; and, in the clutch, our only potential real
            friend, the United States, places the interests of Britain and even a disruptive France
            ahead of the interests of Germany, and ahead of the collective policies it espouses.</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Stabilizing Factors</hi>. The mood, its intensity, its generality,
            and its causes are unmistakable. Its seriousness we will neglect to our peril—a judgment
            shared by Jean Laloy, Jack Nicholls, Michael Palliser, Jens Boyesen, and others in
              <gloss target="#t_APAG1">APAG</gloss>, as well as by our country team in Bonn. But all
            is by no means lost. The roots of the German commitment to a policy of European
            integration and the closest possible ties to the U.S. go deeper than this painful
            interval. The response to my Frankfurt and Bonn speeches was: please lead us in just
            those directions. More important, the plea from Schroeder, <persName corresp="#p_EF4">Erler</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BK6">Birrenbach</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName>, was in the same sense. Men like Barzel and
            Walther Casper are by no means despairing of European and Atlantic progress over the
            longer pull. Distinguished journalists like Georg Schroeder and Bruno Dechamps are a bit
            bloody but unbowed. Men like Eric Blumenfeld and Stefan Thomas are optimistic about a
            policy of enlarged contacts with the East and the long run implications of trends in
            Russia and Eastern Europe. The German youth appears more interested in contacts with
            East Germany than in the Hallstein Doctrine. Germany's extraordinary continued
            prosperity is a substantial (but insufficient) cushion to those shocks and strains.
            Above all, the bilateral military tie remains strong; <persName corresp="#p_HKU1">Von
              Hassel</persName> treasures his tie to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>; and there is only fear at the thought of U.S. troop withdrawals.
            But there is widespread anxiety that, without <pb n="235" xml:id="pg_235" facs="0265"/>U.S. leadership that moves things forward again, even modestly, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> will gain in power. There is little attraction
            for leadership by Paris. It is well understood that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName> cannot defend Germany and he opposes German unity and serious
            European integration. But, if things do not improve, I would predict the outcome will be
            a stronger and more nationally assertive German government, Gaullist only in the sense
            that it will imitate <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> in a more
            forthright use of German national bargaining power vis-à-vis Washington, Paris, and
            Moscow.</p>
                    <p>The Germans by and large would prefer a policy of cooperation rather than a squeaky
            wheel operation; but that's the way they are likely to go unless things look up a
            bit.</p>
                    <p>In this connection, perhaps the most interesting, if faintly ominous, moment of the
              <gloss target="#t_APAG1">APAG</gloss> meeting was Muller-Roschach's measured warning
            that if the Alliance cannot mount a concerted, even if modest, policy of movement on the
            German unity question, Germany will move towards the view that German unity is a
            domestic rather than an international question.</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Six Steps in German Policy Between Now and November</hi>. The
            long-run answer to this problem is clear enough and old enough in our policy: to sink
            German nationalism and its national vulnerability in collective enterprises of Europe
            and the Atlantic; to engage Germany widely and, if possible, collectively on the world
            scene outside Europe; and, against this background, to mount a long term, pacific policy
            looking toward German unity and a European settlement. I can perceive no alternative to
            that policy that meets U.S. interests. And a week in Germany in March 1965 is most
            instructive; because under present strains the shape of the alternatives can be lucidly
            perceived, even if now far from dominant. They are all, at best, ugly and, at worst,
            lethal.</p>
                    <p>But, of course, if our German policy is to move forward starting right now, it can only
            move forward within two powerful constraints: General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName>'s policy; and the German election period. I believe American
            leadership can be exercised in this situation. I have come (under the Secretary's
            prodding) to this definition of U.S. leadership: the achievement of an objective in the
            U.S. interest, at U.S. initiative, by a combination of example, persuasion, and pressure
            when:</p>
                    <p>a. U.S. example, persuasion, and pressure make the object achievable at all;</p>
                    <p>b. when the advantages of achievement outweigh the costs.</p>
                    <p>Right now what we can achieve at all is narrowly limited by <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> and the September election; but I do believe a modest policy of
            movement is possible and inexpensive, if we put our minds to it.</p>
                    <p>Specifically, we can do the following six things, the first four of which are placed in
            a wider setting in paras. 4–6, below:</p>
                    <pb n="236" xml:id="pg_236" facs="0266"/>
                    <p>—Generate in the Quadripartite Group, round about May, an allied policy statement in
            support of German unity.</p>
                    <p>—Start some quiet bilateral talk, on an informal basis, on German unity at the Council
            of Foreign Relations, if the Germans are not ready for deeply buried planning talks,
            while preparing ourselves for some serious talk after September.</p>
                    <p>—Maintain some quiet forward movement on the <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> in the Paris Working Group, while continuing to make
            clear publicly our interest in a collective Atlantic solution to an inescapable Alliance
            problem, and awaiting the outcome of the September election.</p>
                    <p>—Use the Under Secretary's forthcoming trip to Paris and the May Ministerial meeting to
            press for regular regional sessions at the U.S. Assistant Secretary level of interested
            countries, covering: East Europe; Africa; Middle East; South Asia; Far East; and Latin
            America. If this doesn't work at <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> level, offer it
            bilaterally to the Germans as well as the British.</p>
                    <p>—The President might pick up Barzel's (really Casper's) suggestion that we extend the
            Great Society concept through an Atlantic conference (or conferences) to compare and
            exchange views on efforts to improve the quality of our respective affluent societies:
            e.g., air pollution; traffic; education in an automated age; pockets of poverty (U.K.,
            France and Italy have them, Germany extraordinarily little); the social problem of the
            small, inefficient farmer; wage guidelines problems; mental health and retardation; etc.
            After an initial kick-off at highest level, these could give the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> some extra life, give vitality to some unexploited
            strands of common interest in the Atlantic, and project to the rest of the world our
            common concerns with the qualitative margins of our life. (Sarge Shriver is probably the
            man to take this on.)</p>
                    <p>—The greatest of all short-term measures would be, of course, a Presidential trip this
            summer to Germany. In a microscopic way, I could perceive what it means in Germany to
            have a live, visible American stand up and say out loud what our policy is. Georgetown
            and Cleveland speeches are basic; but inevitably distant and abstract. I believe a
            Presidential trip against the background of the other five measures suggested above,
            would put Germany in a mood to go forward with confidence after September on the right
            lines and help get men elected who are faithful to the integrationist cause in Europe
            and to the Atlantic connection.</p>
                    <p>4. <hi rend="italic">A Strategy for German Unity</hi>. Beginning with the question of
            German unity, what now follows merges conclusions drawn from the <gloss target="#t_APAG1">APAG</gloss> meeting and my talks with Germans. The <gloss target="#t_APAG1">APAG</gloss> meeting, at its formal sessions, centered, in fact, on
            two matters, extensively discussed also in my bilateral contacts with Germans: an
            alliance strategy for German unity and the coordination of alliance policy in areas
            outside <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. The third major issue of German concern
            was discussed privately at Reinhartshausen <pb n="237" xml:id="pg_237" facs="0267"/>with
            the British and the Italians; that is, the Paris talks on the <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> until September and prospects
            post-September. These three issues are now discussed in turn.</p>
                    <p>Muller-Roschach pressed the German question strongly in manner but temperately in
            substance (fortiter in modo, suaviter in re). And he evoked what was certainly the best
              <gloss target="#t_APAG1">APAG</gloss> discussion yet of this matter. I would summarize
            it as follows, indicating along the way the emphasis of various members (and various
            Germans) where relevant.</p>
                    <p>(i) It is not safe for the Alliance, for the stability of Central Europe, or for the
            peace for us to accept passively the split of Germany and Europe.</p>
                    <p>(ii) The urgency of creating an Alliance strategy is heightened by the possible decay
            of the Hallstein Doctrine which will force the Germans to move in one way or another.
            And an Alliance strategy is the preferred course.</p>
                    <p>(iii) The achievement of German unity must be peaceful—via historical process,
            negotiation, and persuasion. No one can tell when it will be achieved. What is important
            for Germany and the Alliance is a policy which involves some action in concert. Neither
            accepting the status quo nor waiting for the anonymous forces of history to restore
            unity to the German people will suffice.</p>
                    <p>(iv) Aside from the Hallstein Doctrine, the major headings for an Alliance policy
            looking towards German unity are the following:</p>
                    <p>—declaratory statements</p>
                    <p>—a treaty proposal</p>
                    <p>—policy towards the GDR</p>
                    <p>—policy towards Eastern Europe</p>
                    <p>—policy towards the Soviet Union</p>
                    <p>—arms control</p>
                    <p>(v) <hi rend="italic">Declaratory statements</hi> have a role in Germany, in the
            Alliance, and vis-à-vis the Russians and the rest of the world. But if not accompanied
            by forward movement, they wear thin. They should be used, but sparingly. (<gloss target="#t_APAG1">APAG</gloss> didn't discuss this but, as indicated above, I believe
            between now and September is such a time.)</p>
                    <p>(vi) A treaty proposal to be effective must meet complex criteria:</p>
                    <p>—Given the present Moscow position on Germany, it should not be designed to be
            acceptable now; but it should contain features (security and boundary) which will hold
            out some attraction for Eastern Europe and, perhaps, for Russia in the future, although
            not necessarily final Western positions. As Nicholls said, a treaty proposal must be
            regarded as part of the historical process itself.</p>
                    <p>—The security issues must be dealt with in a way that, while holding out promise to the
            East, does not give the Russians an excessive initial bargaining position and does not
            set in motion neutralist forces in the West (Boyesen, Laloy, Rostow).</p>
                    <pb n="238" xml:id="pg_238" facs="0268"/>
                    <p>—Since immediate Soviet acceptance is not expected, the proposal should be put into
            negotiation in a way that leads, if possible, to protracted Austrian Treaty-type
            discussions, rather than a dramatic show-down with Moscow.</p>
                    <p>The advantages of a treaty proposal, if it can be devised, were judged to be these:</p>
                    <p>—It would reassure the Germans of Allied seriousness while forcing serious thought in
            Germany about what unity entails.</p>
                    <p>—It would dramatize to the East and to the world the pacific features of a German
            settlement.</p>
                    <p>—It would permit smaller steps to be taken as part of a large mosaic, so that they
            would appear less ad hoc and insignificant. (As our country team in Bonn emphasized, and
            I can now attest, this view is held by many thoughtful Germans.)</p>
                    <p>No one was confident that a proposal of this kind could be devised; although the
            technical success of the 1959 package led, on balance, to optimism. All agreed it was
            worth thinking about now and working on after the September election.</p>
                    <p>(vii) <hi rend="italic">As for the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
                        </hi>, it was agreed that in the matter of intra-German contacts, Bonn should be the
            judge of the proper balance; all agreed that Allied recognition of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> was ruled out; as for Allied contacts with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, the Belgians and Danes explained their problems with the
            strongly reiterated (<persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> as well as
            Muller-Roschach) German policy of denying Allied contacts with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and isolating and focusing the Soviet zone on West German
            relations. Since the <gloss target="#t_TTD1">TTD</gloss> (East German travel documents)
            issue was being discussed elsewhere in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, the matter
            was left. (Both Schroeder and <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> expressed
            the need for more West German contacts with East Germany; and <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> revived tentatively the old proposals for mixed commissions. The
            pressure for more contacts with East Germany is clearly rising in West Germany.)</p>
                    <p>(viii) As for Eastern Europe, there was general agreement (with some familiar Dutch
            scepticism) that the forces at work in that region could be turned to Western advantage
            in general, and to assist the process of movement towards German unity in particular. A
            higher degree of concert in the Alliance in orchestrating policies towards Eastern
            Europe was generally approved. (Schroeder spoke in some pain of his difficulties with
            the credit-limit issue and with French egoism in its Eastern European policy; but agreed
            that identity of policy was not necessary on issues other than credit.) The central
            argument in <gloss target="#t_APAG1">APAG</gloss> was that the loss of Moscow's control
            over and diminution of its ideological stake in Eastern Europe would, along with other
            factors, hasten the day when responsible men in Moscow might think the advantages of a
            European security agreement outweighed the costs of surrendering ideological control
            over East Germany. (With respect to Eastern Europe, Vaes reported <persName corresp="#p_RA4">Rapacki</persName>'s <pb n="239" xml:id="pg_239" facs="0269"/>discussion with Spaak on the advantages of first disengagement, then Germany unity.
            Laloy was wonderfully lucid and vigorous in dealing with both <persName corresp="#p_RA4">Rapacki</persName> and Spaak. Vaes privately agreed and deplored Spaak's
            vulnerability on this issue. In the formal meeting he was somewhat inhibited—not by the
            presence of foreigners but by the presence of Spaak's son-in-law, Michael Palliser.)</p>
                    <p>(ix) As for policy towards the Soviet Union, (leaving arms control to section x,
            below), it was accepted that in talking about the peaceful unification of Germany we
            were talking about a basic shift in the character of the Soviet Union and its view of
            the world scene—a transition from ambitions to lead a global ideological system to a
            mature acceptance of its considerable but limited role as a nation state among many.
            Forces were at work tending to press Russian policy in this direction, but clearly the
            day had not come. Nor could anyone predict when it would come. It followed, however,
            that everything we did on the world scene to discourage Soviet hopes that the expansion
            of its ideological power was possible and everything we did to dramatize the place of
            dignity awaiting it as a nation state was relevant to the problem of German unity and a
            European settlement. At the present time, given the case of Communist policy, this bore
            on what we did and failed to do as an Alliance about Communist policies in Asia, the
            Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. And it bore also on our capacity to continue to
            demonstrate the cohesion of the West in defense and other matters.</p>
                    <p>(x) With respect to arms control and a European security settlement, it was agreed that
            the relation between these somewhat separate theologies ought to be looked at closely
            for three reasons. First, it is possible that at a moment when Moscow would be willing
            to contemplate German unity it might also be prepared to contemplate an effectively
            inspected arms control system on a world basis: both go to the heart of the transition
            from a Bolshevik view of the world in Moscow to a more narrowly national view of the
            world. Second, given the changes in military technology since 1959, it may be more
            rational for Moscow, as well as the West, to conceive of a European security arrangement
            in broader terms than has been traditional in German security negotiations; perhaps, for
            example, embracing nuclear weapons systems and delivery capabilities outside Germany,
            from Western Russia to the Atlantic. The rational outcome might be a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>-Warsaw Pact arms control agreement rather than a piece
            of surgery on Germany alone—indeed, a good piece of the total problem of arms control.
            Third, in general arms control negotiations the problems of allied policy towards German
            unity should be kept clearly in mind. They should, if possible, help move towards German
            unity and a European security settlement, rather than away from it.</p>
                    <p>(xi) Although these were the elements in an Alliance policy for German unity and a
            European security settlement, and, although all of us <pb n="240" xml:id="pg_240" facs="0270"/>bore a responsibility for contributing to policy-making and action to
            bring it to pass, Germany had a double responsibility: it had to make concrete policy
            suggestions under these headings, and German political leadership had a responsibility
            for creating a political and psychological environment in Germany which could accept the
            German unity problem in these wide-ranging terms.</p>
                    <p>I have two final comments on this generalization of what transpired on my trip
            concerning the German question.</p>
                    <p>First, it struck me with great force, in talking with Germans, that there was a gap
            between the classic Adenauer position (formalistic statements on German unity plus the
            Hallstein Doctrine) and how Germans thought and talked in private—not merely in talks
            with me alone, but in pretty large groups. The headings under which we considered the
            problem in <gloss target="#t_APAG1">APAG</gloss> did not greatly differ from how
            Germans, in and out of the government, considered the matter (except one Herr Theo Loch
            of the Rheinische Merkur, who said he didn't want any Prussian provinces in Germany and
            was content to rely on the force de frappe for protection. But this is the view of a
            tiny German minority.). In short, it is my impression that after the German election, it
            may well be possible for a German government to talk honest sense on the unity
            issue.</p>
                    <p>Second, there emerged in <gloss target="#t_APAG1">APAG</gloss> a quite strong sentiment
            to enlarge the role of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> on the matter of German
            unity and a European security settlement. The Italians, Canadians, and others spoke of
            their dissatisfaction with the monopolistic role of the Quadripartite Group. The dilemma
            is familiar enough: it is tough enough to get unity in the Quadripartite Group; but, in
            fact, the most vital interests of the whole Alliance are engaged in these matters and,
            as Mario Mondello and Arnold Smith pointed out, the cost of the present system is that
            those outside the Quadripartite Group feel no responsibility for the German unity
            question.</p>
                    <p>My impression at the moment is this: If we can get anything like agreement over the
            next year on an Alliance strategy towards German unity and a European settlement, either
            in the Quadripartite Group or as among the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, Germany,
            and U.S. (and I am confident this is possible), we ought to widen parallel discussions
            in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>—notably on the strategy as a whole and the
            non-treaty aspects of that strategy (e.g., policy towards Eastern Europe).</p>
                    <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Consultation</hi>. There was much talk of consultation—between
            Germans and myself and within <gloss target="#t_APAG1">APAG</gloss>. I was alerted to
            the cutting edge of the problem by a widespread German view which is this: OK, we
            consulted with the Americans on the Middle East; we agreed to carry some of the White
            Man's burden with the tanks for Israel; we were assured that our position with the Arabs
            wouldn't blow; it blew; for quite a while the Americans were out to lunch; they finally
            helped with courage and fraternity; but the lesson for Germany is—no consultation, just
            a nice, <pb n="241" xml:id="pg_241" facs="0271"/>straightforward policy of narrow
            national interest. With Germans I tried to turn this around, arguing that the Middle
            East was a very tough area where you could easily meet yourself coming through a
            swinging door; successively, there was Suez, Lebanon-Jordan, the U.S. miseries over
            Yemen, the current German miseries. On each occasion one or two of us felt extremely
            lonely, while the others moved in gallantly to pick up the commercial change and to
            represent Western interests. Moreover, we felt damned lonely in Laos and South Viet Nam;
            the Belgians and we were lonely in the Congo; the British and Germans pretty lonely in
            East Africa; etc. The lesson was that the serious interests in the Middle East and
            elsewhere were common interests; namely, to keep the regions tolerably pacified, to
            strengthen the hands of the moderates, and to keep Communist influence within bounds.
            The answer was more sustained, wider, and more responsible consultation, not less.</p>
                    <p>There was, on the whole, a German willingness to listen to this argument, although they
            will be shy about weapons and soldiers outside Germany for quite a while, except as part
            of a completely integrated <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> force. (As Barzel put
            it to me, better than his reported statements in Washington, what if they turned up one
            ex-Nazi sergeant in Cyprus or South Viet Nam?) If we move rapidly on consultation, I am
            convinced the Germans will play either multilaterally or even bilaterally, notably in
            economic and political matters.</p>
                    <p>Against this background, conscious of the Under Secretary's impending mission to Paris,
            and after some preliminary talks the first night at <gloss target="#t_APAG1">APAG</gloss>, I put in a paper entitled (after Jack Nicholls' suggestion) “The
            Resolution of Reinhartshausen.” It was designed to dramatize the urgency of regular
            consultation at the one critical level where consultation does not now systematically
            exist; namely, that of the U.S. Assistant Secretary with operational (rather than
            planning) responsibilities. Its critical passage was the following:</p>
                    <p>1. They should engage government representatives who bear direct operational
            responsibility for the conduct of policy in the area concerned.</p>
                    <p>2. They should be regularly conducted, whether crises exist or not, with provision for
            extraordinary meetings.</p>
                    <p>3. They should be open to all <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> members interested
            in the area and prepared to attend.</p>
                    <p>4. The Secretary General, or his representative, should preside; and the Council should
            be informed of the results.</p>
                    <p>5. With respect to diplomatic proposals for German unity and European security, the
            three Western occupying powers bear a special responsibility. But, in respect to other
            matters, the objective should not be <pb n="242" xml:id="pg_242" facs="0272"/>to yield
            total uniformity of action by <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> members, but rather
            to produce:</p>
                    <p>a. a common understanding of the problems involved and of the common vital interests at
            stake;</p>
                    <p>b. collective or individual policies designed to reflect that understanding and those
            interests, with the subsequent conduct of each member to be determined by the special
            character of his limitations and possibilities for action in the area.</p>
                    <p>I knew Jean Laloy could not sign on and he understood exactly the purpose of the
            exercise, which we discussed. The substance of the message was broadly agreed, after
            various statesmanlike reservations, and, of course, not in the form of a resolution. It
            will be incorporated in some anodyne form in the Secretariat report to the Council; but,
            more important, it will be taken home to the various capitals.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">My recommendation is this:</p>
                    <p>a. The Under Secretary should make a strong pitch for systematic consultation along
            these lines at <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> at the end of the month;</p>
                    <p>b. The issue should be pressed at the May Ministerial meetings;</p>
                    <p>c. If there is no agreement, we should beef up and make more systematic our bilaterals
            with Great Britain and Germany, perhaps bringing the three of us together in tune with
            the Canadians (now hooked in Ceylon and Tanzania), the Italians, and any other
            interested parties, on an ad hoc basis.</p>
                    <p>In this matter of homely, practical responsible consultations on dirty, difficult
            problems, we should not let a French veto frustrate us. I suspect we could get agreement
            to consult regularly in Washington.</p>
                    <p>6. <hi rend="italic">
                            <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>
                        </hi>. This matter was not discussed formally in <gloss target="#t_APAG1">APAG</gloss>.
            I talked with <persName corresp="#p_SU2">Scheske</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> at some length. Also, at their initiative, with
            Nicholls and Palliser; and then, at his initiative, with Farace.</p>
                    <p>The upshot is the following.</p>
                    <p>a. The Germans will file, I believe, a paper replying to our questions about the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> position.</p>
                    <p>b. The German anxieties about the British position are: the scale of the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> component; the proportionate shares (which they want
            equal and not distorted by assorted British nationally manned hardware); the assignment
            to a new commander rather than <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss>; the Italian
            pressure for a European clause more explicit than they or we want and the British
            insistence on no European clause; and their (the German) desire to avoid any further
            nuclear-denial commitments outside a German settlement.</p>
                    <p>c. <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName>, at least, is clear that all these
            matters are negotiable with the British, given the underlying U.K. position (see
            below).</p>
                    <p>d. What the Germans want right now is: a U.S. initiative to get the Paris talks going;
            a U.S. position that helps narrow the gap quietly in Paris <pb n="243" xml:id="pg_243" facs="0273"/>so that motion is maintained and things are more nearly ready by
            September; some high level overt statement of the continuity of the U.S. interest on an
            integrated settlement with a substantial <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> component
            to supplement the statement at the Ranch.</p>
                    <p>e. On the critical question—whether the Germans would be willing to face a
            confrontation with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> after September on
            the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>—I got various answers which I reported by cable.
            The Foreign Office view is clearly (from <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName>
            as well as <persName corresp="#p_SU2">Scheske</persName>) that this is a matter of
            German national interest; and that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>
            cannot and should not have the right both to a force de frappe and a French veto on
            German participation in a collective effort. So far as German unity is concerned,
            Germany's nuclear role must, evidently, be considered in a general settlement. But one
            should not forego doing what is right in the West in the vague hope of a German
            settlement, when none is in sight. It is, however, correct to make a change in Germany's
            nuclear role explicitly a part of a German settlement, and to signal that fact in an
              <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> treaty.
              <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> would not predict the position of a
            German government after September.</p>
                    <p>Another view is, simply, that <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> is
            dominated by a desire to be elected in his own right. If the present political
            constellation is returned to power, he would cheerfully face down <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> on this and other matters—notably since
              <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>'s threat of breaking up the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> is no longer credible.</p>
                    <p>There is general agreement, right or wrong, that a grand coalition of the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> would have no problem
            with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> and the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>; and this is a possible and widely hoped for result.</p>
                    <p>What I would add to my cabled view is that the posture of the U.S. on the short run
            issues laid out in para. 3, above, may significantly determine what kind of German
            government we get in September and what its policy will then be. We should try to behave
            in such a way as to strengthen the Atlanticists in the German election, while we move
            quietly in Paris to bring the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, Germany, and Italy
            together, so that we can move or not move promptly when we know the constitution and
            temper of the new German government.</p>
                    <p>f. As for Nicholls and Palliser, they report the following. The present <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> government wants a settlement. The <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> component, the financial shares, the command issue are all negotiable.
            The European clause presents political difficulties in Parliament, although a weak
            European clause is not ruled out. (Strangely, this may prove the toughest issue.) They
            are primarily concerned with: whether a new German government would face down <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>; whether a new British election and the return
            of a Conservative government would throw the thing off the track again, for a while; and
            about the tendency of the Conservatives, having carefully analyzed the strong
            pro-European content of the Liberal vote, may turn to a loose European deterrent,
            notably in the face of what they <pb n="244" xml:id="pg_244" facs="0274"/>regard as weak
            U.K. leadership in this matter. In general, they want almost precisely what the Germans
            want out of Paris: U.S. leadership in getting the Paris meetings started; U.S.
            leadership in quietly narrowing the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>-German positions
            so that we are tolerably prepared by September; an interval to assess the temper of the
            new German government in this matter; then rapid diplomatic movement to button it
            up.</p>
                    <p>g. Although others in the Italian Foreign Office are probably more knowledgeable,
            Farace drew me aside to ask what we thought should and could be done in the Paris
            meetings. I told him that Washington was in the process of evaluating the <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>
            visit when I left. I did not know what would be decided in Washington about the Paris
            talks; but it was my personal view that the British and German and Italian views were
            not as far apart as might appear; that we should use Paris quietly to narrow the gap
            between now and September; and then we would see. And, indeed, that is my
            recommendation.</p>

                    <p>The Secretary said that the Germans want some initiative on reunification but are
            reluctant to get into a consideration of borders and security arrangements. We are
            prepared to be helpful but are not clear what can be done. We have picked up the idea of
            a statement on May 8, but this has been somewhat downgraded by premature publicity. The
            problem is that if we make proposals to the Russians they may come back with counter
            proposals for a free city status for Berlin and we could find ourselves back in the
            crisis atmosphere of 1961. We have no desire to see a repetition of the Western disarray
            of that period when we found very little support among our allies, with the exception of
            the British. The Secretary said that we have a preliminary draft of a May 8 statement
            and it is up to the Germans to say whether or not it meets their needs.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Secretary said that while electoral considerations are prompting the
            Germans to urge a Western initiative at this time, a further motivation results from the
            difficulties they are experiencing with the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and
            other Arab states. The Federal Republic is concerned at the prospect of further
            recognitions of the East German regime and hopes to discourage such action by a Western
            declaration. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM12">Stewart</persName> said that there is no
            immediate prospect of getting anywhere on reunification and this means that a Western
            statement can be hardly more than a series of platitudes. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> said that our draft statement emphasizes
            four-power responsibility, but the Germans would like to include a reference to
            negotiations; this causes problems since there is no agreed Western position; the
            Germans say that it is impossible to get their political leaders to focus on the problem
            until negotiations are about to begin. Sir <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Harold</persName>
            said that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had emphasized that disarmament
            would have to be a precondition to reunification. The Secretary noted that security
            arrangements and disarmament would have to be a part of an agreement on reunification.
            The Foreign Secretary replied that reunification cannot be achieved without the
            agreement of the Russians and that is not in prospect. The Secretary said that in
            December <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had suggested that there might
            be some point in resuming bilateral US/Soviet talks and he did not exclude the
            possibility of injecting some new elements in the discussions. The Secretary recalled
            that the previous bilateral talks in 1961 were limited to the problem of Berlin. He said
            that we are not enthusiastic about resuming these talks without knowing what our allies
            think.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that in the course of the German election campaign, we can
            anticipate agitation on the question of the Eastern territories and public statements
            requiring a reaction from us. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM12">Stewart</persName> said
            emphatically that there is no prospect of the Germans recovering the lost territories
            and they should be in no doubt on the score. A reunified Germany within present borders
            is what is required. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName>
                        <pb n="246" xml:id="pg_246" facs="0276"/>said Germany would like some minor border
            rectifications, for example in the Stettin area.</p>

                    <p>2. Vice President <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName>, toasting Mayor
            Brandt at luncheon he gave for him at Blair House, said after heavy harassment of Berlin
            we respect Berlin more. After recent harassment we and our Allies took another good look
            at situation. It caused us to remember importance of our Alliance and we hope every
            member noticed. Brandt called Berlin success story of West and especially of US.</p>
                    <p>Brandt told Vice President after luncheon <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> was not
            interested in becoming a nuclear power but felt it was legitimate for Germans to
            participate in shaping of strategy involving nuclear arms. The Vice President told
            Brandt our long-range missiles and Polaris submarines were most reliable and most
            important substitute for <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>s. Vice President said
            Soviets were under no illusion re purpose and dependability of US deterrent.</p>
                    <p>3. During call on Secretary, Brandt and <persName corresp="#p_EF4">Erler</persName>
            asked for Secretary's assessment of Viet-Nam situation. Both deeply impressed with
            Secretary's presentation and promised to contribute to greater understanding in Germany
            for US position and intentions in Viet-Nam.</p>
                    <p>On German reunification Brandt expressed hope for some kind of expression, hopefully
            tripartite but at minimum from US alone, on German reunification on May 8. Brandt
            recognized such appeal as morale factor and not substantive move toward reunification.
            Felt it would be useful particularly for German voters and especially youth born in 1944
            who would cast first ballot on Sept. 19. Brandt hoped for more substantive moves after
            elections. Secretary said we were still hoping for tripartite declaration but without
            doubt as minimum would do something on our own on May 8.</p>
                    <pb n="248" xml:id="pg_248" facs="0278"/>
                    <p>On Berlin Brandt saw recent Soviet harassment<note n="4" xml:id="d101fn4">See <ref target="#d100fn2">footnote 2, Document 100</ref>.</note> as support pried out of
            Soviets by <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, praised US “massive political-diplomatic
            steps,” suggested we seek to discuss with Soviets recent “military maneuvers” so that
            they could not become weapon used repeatedly against Berlin. Secretary stated we had
            underestimated degree of Soviet-<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> reaction to
            Bundestag meeting. Secretary added we did not use all possible countermeasures because
            of pre-announced limitations of harassment and subsequent short duration.</p>
                    <p>Last major theme raised by Brandt and <persName corresp="#p_EF4">Erler</persName> was
            European unity. Brandt and <persName corresp="#p_EF4">Erler</persName> both said British
            were changing their views on Common Market. Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> stated we would like to see <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> join
            Common Market on Common Market, not <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss>, terms.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EF4">Erler</persName> asked that we coordinate better our trade
            policies with Eastern Europe. Suggested that <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> be
            improved. He considered long-term credits for <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
            nothing more than development aid.</p>
                    <p>4. In meeting with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, Brandt
            suggested effort be made to reach understanding with Soviets re future Communist
            military maneuvers around Berlin so that Western access would not be interfered with.
            Brandt said he saw no present indication that Communists would interfere with access in
            future. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> expressed view Communists had
            achieved some psychological impact by showing force that they could bring to bear around
            Berlin. On French policy, Brandt and <persName corresp="#p_EF4">Erler</persName> thought
            French position in Common Market had passed point of no return. <persName corresp="#p_EF4">Erler</persName> considered French flirtation with Moscow to have
            nuisance value rather than as serious effort to establish alliance with Russians.</p>
                    <p>On alliance nuclear organization <persName corresp="#p_EF4">Erler</persName> felt
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> unwilling make any decisions before September
            elections and eager to avoid hassle with French. <persName corresp="#p_EF4">Erler</persName> implied Germans would prefer greater role in strategic planning and
            targeting without creation of new nuclear force and felt this was also British approach.
              <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> stressed US desire to be helpful to
            its non-nuclear allies in Europe. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and
              <persName corresp="#p_EF4">Erler</persName> agreed that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> should employ whatever weapons might be necessary to achieve its
            objectives and that study is required to determine that conventional weapons are
            available as necessary. <persName corresp="#p_EF4">Erler</persName> suggested that
            Germans should talk frankly to French about French policies indicating in which areas
            they could follow French and where they could not follow, as in French policy toward
              <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_EF4">Erler</persName>
            said nuclear problem has not been solved and will recur.</p>
                    <p>5. In meeting with <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">McGeorge Bundy</persName>, Brandt said
            that he thought foreign policy would not be election issue, that he does not plan go
            Moscow before elections but would not close door to ultimate visit. In connection <pb n="249" xml:id="pg_249" facs="0279"/>with Hallstein Doctrine Brandt said problem
            essentially one of maintaining and broadening contacts. He agreed with <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>'s present course in Eastern Europe of building relations
            gradually, with initial emphasis on economic contacts.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> said that although his
            Government had been unenthusiastic from the beginning about the idea of a new allied
            statement on German unity, they were prepared to go along with such a gesture. The
              <gloss target="#t_GOF1">GOF</gloss> believed it would lead nowhere and supposed that
            neither we nor the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> had any illusions. The Ambassador
            said he was under instructions from Paris to submit for our consideration the attached
            new draft of such an allied declaration.<note n="2" xml:id="d102fn2">Not printed.</note>
            He believed it was substantially the same as the earlier draft but somewhat terser. The
            new French draft omitted any mention of the U.N. They thought this was a good idea since
            the U.N. had never been brought into the German matter. Neither did their draft refer to
            relations between the two Germanies, but rather held to the basic idea that
            reunification must be based on self-determination. They reaffirmed Four-Power
            responsibility, emphasizing the relationship of the German problem to European security.
            He said <pb n="250" xml:id="pg_250" facs="0280"/>that the draft had been shown to the
            German Charge in Paris who considered it adequate. It had also been shown to the German
            Embassy here. The French Ambassador in London was presenting the draft to the Foreign
            Office.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> said that a second question
            was the date of the declaration. May 8 would hardly be good from a German viewpoint.
              <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> would be in Paris April 24–30. The
            Germans wished to refer to the declaration in the communiqué following the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting May 11. Therefore, sometime between the first
            and the eighth of May seemed best. An early date might preempt a Soviet statement on the
            same matter. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> suggested that
            May Day might not be the best time and that it might be wise not to leave the Soviets
            much time to respond between issuance of the declaration and the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting.</p>
                    <p>Finally, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> suggested that the
            text of the declaration and the date of its issuance be considered in a meeting of the
            Ambassadorial Group Tuesday, April 20.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> said that at first glance
            the French draft seemed a good one and, subject to the Secretary's views, we would
            consider taking it up in a meeting of the Ambassadorial Group April 20. We would take
            appropriate steps to convene such a meeting.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> raised the question of how
            the declaration would be made. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName>
            conjectured that it might be delivered by Ambassadors of the three Western powers to the
            Foreign Office in Moscow. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName>
            suggested that the best procedure might be parallel public statements in each of the
            three Western capitals. It was agreed that this question of procedure could be discussed
            in the Ambassadorial Group also.</p>

                    <p rend="center">The Problem</p>
                    <p>To estimate the principal trends in West German foreign policy during the next two
            years or so.</p>
                    <p rend="center">Conclusions</p>
                    <p>A. West German leaders are becoming increasingly impatient to adopt a more
            self-reliant, distinctively German, foreign policy. Conscious of their country's growing
            economic and military strength, they are eager to attain a more influential position
            within the Western Alliance and a greater share in the formulation of Western defense
            and nuclear policies. At the same time, they are anxious to impart momentum, if
            necessary on their own, toward the reunification of their country. Whatever the outcome
            of the national election this fall, we believe that during the next two years or so
            these tendencies will be reflected in a more assertive style and some differences of
            emphasis in foreign policy. Nevertheless, barring important external developments, the
            West German government will probably be constrained by practical considerations—notably
            the rigidity of the power relationship in Europe—from making any major changes in the
            basic lines of policy. (Paras. 1–11)</p>
                    <p>B. Specifically, we believe that West Germany will retain its present commitments in
            Europe and the Western Alliance for the period of this estimate, and will continue to
            depend on US nuclear power to protect the integrity of its borders and those of West
            Berlin. Though we expect sympathy to grow for <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName>'s idea of “Europe for the Europeans,” with some accompanying
            interest in a European nuclear force, West Germany's strong defense ties with the US
            will almost certainly prevent a significant shift away from present defense policy
            during the next two years or so. (Paras. 12–19)</p>
                    <p>C. In policy toward the Communist world the new West German administration will be
            likely to make more vigorous attempts than its predecessor to take the initiative. This
            will almost certainly include further <pb n="252" xml:id="pg_252" facs="0282"/>efforts
            to expand the West German position in Eastern Europe. It may also be reflected in moves
            to resolve the German question by direct discussions with the Soviet leaders and
            additional steps to “normalize” relations with East Germany. Yet substantial progress in
            any of these spheres is unlikely unless an important shift occurs in Soviet policy
            toward Germany; a marked acceleration in the trend toward independence or internal
            “liberalization” in Eastern Europe could also open up new opportunities for West Germany
            in the area. (Paras. 20–23)</p>
                    <p>D. Beyond the period of this estimate, we believe the potentiality for important
            changes in West German foreign policy will increase. In the event of rapid or
            fundamental changes outside Germany—e.g., in the Communist world or the Western
            Alliance—West German leaders may find themselves in a position to act independently in a
            way which would importantly affect the interests of their allies, favorably or
            adversely. For example, if the Soviets eventually are forced by events to reassess their
            position in Europe, this might open the way for a West German-Soviet agreement to
            resolve the German question at the expense of the East German regime and perhaps of
            Bonn's Western allies. Or future West German leaders might be tempted to seek to exploit
            popular frustration over the absence of visible movement toward reunification and might
            thus tend to revive German chauvinism and the appeal of a boisterous and intolerant
              extremism.<note n="2" xml:id="d103fn2">The Director of Intelligence and Research,
              Department of State, feels that this Conclusion does not adequately represent either
              the negative or positive possibilities over the longer term. In particular, it fails
              to note such possible favorable developments as a post-de Gaulle softening of French
              opposition toward European integration, significant progress toward reunification
              consistent with US interests in a changed international context, continuing economic
              prosperity, and especially the attraction of a strong political-military tie to the
              US. Moreover, the Conclusion omits such critically important adverse possibilities
              (mentioned in Para. 27) as major disturbances in Alliance relations, which could cause
              Bonn to reopen fundamental questions of defense policy. [Footnote in the source

            (Western Three Declaration on Germany).<note n="2" xml:id="d104fn2">At the April 20
              Ambassadorial Group meeting, the French had introduced their draft statement and the
              United States had outlined requests for modifications in its language. A report on
              these discussions is in telegram 3169 to Bonn, April 20. (Ibid., Central Files, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 32–4 <gloss target="#t_GER1">GER</gloss>)</note>
            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> quipped “even a pygmy”.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName> said the situation with
            respect to the Declaration is “bad”. If no declaration at all were issued, that would be
            most unfortunate. Even if unilateral declarations were made, Moscow could use the
            differences in them to split the Allies. <persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName> said his instructions are: (1) to support the American
            suggestion of an added sentence which makes clear Four-Power responsibility for the
            reunification of Germany; (2) to see if a unanimous declaration can be found. <persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName> said that at lunch today <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> had said that if the Americans continue to insist
            on their sentence or on the compromise which they offered and which Paris has already
            turned down, we will then have a deadlock and he will return to the original French
            draft.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> said if <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> could accept our sentence there would be no
            impasse. Even if the sentence is somewhat repetitious of other language in the
            declaration, this should not be an obstacle to its acceptance. <persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName> agreed.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName> said, speaking personally, he had told
              <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> that perhaps paragraph one of the
            Declaration could be changed sufficiently to take account of the American requirements.
              <persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName> thought the word “continuing” might
            be inserted before “obligations and responsibilities”; also “German reunification” could
            replace the word “German”; the word “incumbent” could be changed to some other word
            which could more accurately reflect the meaning of the French text.</p>
                    <pb n="254" xml:id="pg_254" facs="0284"/>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> said the real difficulty was
            that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> had linked the Declaration
            to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>'s February 4 press conference. We
            did not agree with the French position as stated by <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName>. We have suggested a formula which does not mean acceptance of the
            French point of view by us nor of our point of view by them. This formula is the
            addition of the phrase “all of the peoples concerned” rather than the words “of Europe,”
            at the end of paragraph 3.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName> said he contradicted <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> strongly regarding the role of the US in relation
            to the German problem, pointing out that at the Peace Conference it was necessary for
            the US to be present. Under no circumstances could the Germans envisage the US not being
            present.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> said he felt that even
            though Paris had already rejected the “all of the peoples concerned” compromise he
            nevertheless felt this was still the best one from the French standpoint and should be
            acceptable to them. <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> said we would rather
            have unilateral statements than buy the French line if it comes to that.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Von Staden asked if the placement of the sentence proposed by the US was important.
            Thompson replied our preference was for after the third paragraph but we could accept it
            at the end of the Declaration. Another possibility would be to drop the French sentence
            at the end of the third paragraph and drop our sentence too.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName> said that the Germans do
            not like the fact that the only reference to reunification is that the German people
            “asks for its reunification.” Thompson thought that paragraph one might be revised to
            include reunification. The US wants it clear that it retains its interests in the German
            problem and Europe; as he had stated in the Ambassadorial Group, we maintain six
            divisions as well as nuclear weapons there. <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> said the future is what is important for us with respect to
            Europe.</p>
                    <p>Von Staden thought there were many possible changes which could be made. The real
            problem is the French rejection of the compromise “of all the peoples concerned”, which
            is neutral and protects their position.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName> said Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> is strong on the need to emphasize Four-Power
            responsibility for the German question and supports the US suggested added
            statement.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> referred to an article
            appearing in Die Welt on the Western Three Declaration, and said it was regrettable that
            press leaks continue. <persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName> said that Federal
            Press Chief von <persName corresp="#p_HKG1">Hase</persName> had already replied as
            follows to this article: “The responsibility of the Four Powers is the decisive
            foundation of German reunification policy. There is no thought of reducing or
            eliminating this Four-Power responsibility as the main element of German policy. The
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> would consider it unwise to alter anything in
            connection with this firmly agreed state of affairs.”</p>
                    <pb n="255" xml:id="pg_255" facs="0285"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> said that he had pointed out to
              <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> that the first sentence of the fourth
            paragraph appeared to take adequate account of the main point raised by the French.</p>
                    <p>Von Staden suggested one compromise might be to drop the final sentence of paragraph
            one of the French draft and put in the sentence the US was advocating. Ambassador
              <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> questioned the usefulness of this but
            said he would have to refer the suggestion to his government. He said he wanted to be
            clear that we were not going to agree in the draft Declaration or any other place to the
            emphasis on Europe which the French were attempting to urge. Speaking personally, he
            thought that there were five possibilities: (1) drop the second sentence of the first
            paragraph and the final sentence of the third paragraph and insert in its stead, at an
            appropriate place, the responsibility of the Western Three governments to work for
            reunification. (2) The words “of all the peoples in Europe” could be replaced by “of all
            peoples concerned” at the end of the third paragraph. (3) The last sentence of the third
            paragraph could be dropped and our sentence could come later in the Declaration. (4)
            Eliminate both the final sentence of the third paragraph and the sentence proposed by
            the US. (5) We could all issue differing unilateral statements if agreement on a Western
            Three Declaration is not possible.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName> said that on the question
            of the date of issuance the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> prefers May 5, 6, or 7
            to other dates that have been suggested, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> thought the French may wish to make a statement on May 8
            themselves. He said Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> had told
            him that the French may have to make their position clear in the public mind on the
            effort to arrive at a Western Three Declaration. If the French do go to the press we
            will probably get a polemical statement, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> thought.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MISH1">McIntyre</persName> said that he had been told by Mr.
            Morizet, Counselor of the French Embassy, that the French cannot report possible
            compromises to Paris at this time—their instructions are so strict, Morizet said, that
            without an Ambassadorial Group meeting they would not be able to take up with Paris the
            question of possible compromises. Morizet had noted that compromises which the Americans
            had put forward so far had all been previously rejected by Paris in any case. Ambassador
              <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> said that the French cannot run our
            business for us. He thought it would be better if a declaration could be worked out
            without having an Ambasssadorial Group meeting, but stated that we are ready to meet if
            the others wish a meeting, <persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName> said that
            the only compromise which <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> had discussed
            with him was to broaden the language of the second sentence of the first paragraph so
            that it read “obligations and responsibilities concerning Germany as a whole” rather
            than “obligations and responsibilities concerning Germany”.</p>
                    <pb n="256" xml:id="pg_256" facs="0286"/>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> emphasized that it is
            important to stress that Four-Power responsibility continues into the future. When
              <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> spoke on February 4 he was speaking
            of the future and it is important that we not lend support to his conception of how the
            German problem will be solved. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> said that he hoped Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName> agreed with him that it was important, if an Ambassadorial
            Group meeting is held, that we do not permit the French to split the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and the US.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName> thought that the clarification issued
            by the French Foreign Office on February 5, which followed on the heels of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>'s February 4 press conference, could perhaps be
            worked into a declaration. He expressed the view that if a declaration is not agreed and
            it becomes necessary for individual members of the Ambassadorial Group to issue
            unilateral statements, it will be particularly bad for the French in German public
            opinion. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> said we should hold
            firm—the French are now in an impossible position.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Von Staden said the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> would prefer the language
            “in the whole of Germany” to “in the two parts of Germany” in paragraph three. <persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName> did not think that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> should press for the change, however, and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> agreed. <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> said that is the language “in the whole of Germany” were used we
            would open ourselves to a propaganda onslaught by the Soviets since they would argue
            that self-determination applied in the whole of Germany would give an unfair advantage
            to the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> since it is far more populous than the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> thought, although other
            possibilities might exist, the most promising possibilities for reaching agreement are:
            (1) inclusion of our sentence at either the end of the third paragraph or the end of the
            Declaration; (2) drop the French final sentence of paragraph 3 and our sentence; or (3)
            substitute “of all the peoples concerned” for “of all the peoples of Europe”.</p>

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName> called on Ambassador
              <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> under instructions to make a
            compromise proposal regarding the Western Three declaration on Germany. The Germans were
            making this suggestion, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName>
            noted, in an effort to save the Western Three-Power declaration on Germany. The Germans
            were coming to us before going to the French with the proposal. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> was also describing its proposal to its embassies in
            Paris and London but they will not mention it to the French and British until it has
            been discussed with the United States and our reaction is obtained.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName> said the Germans suggest
            the following re-draft of the second sentence of the declaration:</p>
                    <p>“The Governments of the Republic of France, the United Kingdom and the United States of
            America in conjunction with the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany have
            recently undertaken a further examination of the German problem and of the prospects for
            a resumption of discussions on this subject with the Government of the Soviet Union.
            They have taken this action by virtue of the obligations and responsibilities concerning
            Germany, including Berlin and access thereto, devolving <pb n="259" xml:id="pg_259" facs="0289"/>upon them without change since the end of the Second World
            War—obligations and responsibilities which the Three Governments share with the
            Government of the Soviet Union and which have been reaffirmed by the heads of government
            of all the four powers in Geneva on July 23, 1955, in a directive aiming at the solution
            of the German question by the reunification of Germany.”</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName> said that if the US found
            difficulty with this suggestion there was another one he could make, although it was not
            an official proposal. This would be to delete the second sentence of the draft
            declaration, first paragraph, and insert the following sentence at the end of the
            declaration:</p>
                    <p>“The Three Governments reemphasize the obligations and responsibilities concerning
            Germany including Berlin and access thereto devolving upon them without change since the
            end of the Second World War—obligations and responsibilities which they share with the
            Government of the Soviet Union and which were reaffirmed by the heads of government of
            all the Four Powers in Geneva on July 23, 1955 in a directive aiming at the solution of
            the German question by the reunification of Germany.”</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> noted that even if sentences
            such as those suggested by the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> were included in the
            declaration the fundamental difficulty with the French draft nevertheless remained,
            i.e., its emphasis upon the solution of the German problem as primarily a matter for the
            Europeans. He observed that the 1955 declaration was 10 years old; also, even though the
            Soviets agreed to it at one time, for many years they have attacked the declaration.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName> suggested personally that
            one additional idea might be to say “of all European peoples as well as the other
            peoples concerned” at the end of paragraph three in place of the words “of Europe”. He
            noted, however, that this was probably unacceptable to the French.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> expressed appreciation that
            the Germans had asked us about their compromise proposal before approaching the French.
            He said, however, that he did not think that revising paragraph (1) was helpful. We have
            offered three compromises which are reasonable and should be acceptable to the French.
            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName> agreed with Ambassador
              <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> that the French concept regarding
            responsibility for the solution of the German problem in the future must not be
            accepted. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> thought that the
            French are now in an impossible position. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> said he could not in good conscience recommend acceptance of
              <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>'s dictat. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> thought that if the sentence suggested by the
            Germans were placed in the first paragraph it would be impossible for the US to accept.
            Even if it went at the end of the declaration it would be doubtful.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> thought there was a very
            real danger in putting the German compromise proposal to the French now for it would
            take off them pressure for real movement. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> said it was better to hold to the compromises we have already
            proposed.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName> stated that he personally
            wondered what would happen if no Three Power declaration were agreed. He referred to the
            conversation of the Secretary with Brandt,<note n="2" xml:id="d106fn2">See <ref target="#d101">Document 101</ref>.</note> noting that the Secretary had indicated
            that if there were no agreed declaration the US might issue a unilateral statement.
              <persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName> regretted the fact that Brandt had
            talked publicly following his visit with the Secretary. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> thought there were two possibilities: (1) that
            we could make a <pb n="260" xml:id="pg_260" facs="0290"/>joint statement with the
            British or (2) a unilateral statement, possibly in a speech which might be made at a
            high level in the United States Government on or about May 7. It would obviously be
            easier on the French if we issued a unilateral statement rather than a joint statement
            with the British. Our preference would probably be for a unilateral statement.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName> thought that if a break
            occurs on the negotiation for a declaration there will be a severe reaction against

            and now unpleasant problem of draft Tripartite Declaration on Germany. If he raises you

              (<gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 3268 to Bonn, repeated Paris 5579).<note n="3" xml:id="d107fn3">Not printed. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 32–4

            particularly substituting the phrase “of all the peoples concerned” for the words “of
            all the peoples of Europe,” would seem adequately to protect the French point of view.
            If the phrase “of all the peoples concerned” were included, we would not insist upon
            inclusion of the sentence we had suggested and, you may wish to note, the French draft
            would still include in para three the phrase “on the continent” and in para four a clear
            reference to the security of “all <pb n="261" xml:id="pg_261" facs="0291"/>European
            states.” You may say to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> that we were
            surprised and disappointed by <gloss target="#t_GOF1">GOF</gloss> unwillingness accept
            such minor change in otherwise completely French-drafted text. Nevertheless, we continue

                    <p>In my conversation today with <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> Schroeder, he
            expressed himself as follows in response to a question I put to him regarding his

            agreed revisions. Following discussions in the <gloss target="#t_AG1">AG</gloss> it was
            the <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>'s impression that at the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting before last, held at The Hague, the other three
            powers had “almost” agreed to the German publication of their proposal as a German plan.
            It had been his expectation that the plan, moreover, would be given some type of
            separate national support by the other three, although the <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> did not seem clear just what this would constitute.</p>
                    <p>Rather than proceed virtually alone, however, the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
            had subsequently proposed at the Paris <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting in
            December 1964,<note n="4" xml:id="d108fn4">See <ref target="#d75">Document
              75</ref>.</note> that the Four-Power Council proposal be put forward as an initial
            step which would hopefully lead to the ultimate acceptance of their revised 1963 peace
            plan in its entirety. They considered this substitute initial proposal also still to be
            before the <gloss target="#t_AG1">AG</gloss>. Following the Secretary of State's
            backgrounder of last December, however, and the subsequent explanation of the US
            position by the US representative on the <gloss target="#t_AG1">AG</gloss>, the Germans
            concluded that they would be expected to agree in advance to concrete positions on such
            vital questions as boundaries and security measures, before we would be willing to
            proceed with their Four-Power Council proposal.</p>
                    <p>The Germans are, according to the <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>, ready for
            frank discussions on these questions at any time there is an indication of real interest
            on the part of the Soviets. Since the Soviets at present display no interest, he does
            not consider it feasible for the Germans to agree to proposals in the <gloss target="#t_AG1">AG</gloss> which would probably become known and merely serve to
            solidify the status quo. The Germans are forced into a position of “rebus sic
            stantibus.” As a result, the Germans' immediate objective is to revive the concept of
            Four-Power responsibility for Germany as a whole. In the Four-Power Council proposal
            they see a way of forcing a statement of the Soviet position on this question.</p>
                    <p>For tactical reasons they are not, however, pushing this proposal at the present time,
            but have withdrawn to the position of asking what proposals the other three have to
            offer. In the meantime, however, they consider that both the peace plan and Four-Power
            Council proposals are still before the <gloss target="#t_AG1">AG</gloss>. In the
            meantime, having <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s remarks on frontiers

                        <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName>, on his own initiative, told me that he
            expected to discuss the wording of the declaration on Germany next Monday in London. He
            seemed to think a solution could be found. I told him this matter had assumed the
            proportions it has because the wording at <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName>'s press conference had created an issue perhaps where one had not
            existed before. I told him I could see no reason why the substitution of the words “of
            all peoples concerned” for the phrase referring to the peoples of Europe only was not
            acceptable. <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> then pointed out that it was
            nations in which the United States was definitely included which would work out the
            eventual agreement for German reunification. This would not come about except by the
            evolution of Europe which would involve only the people of Europe. I told him I thought
            this was a somewhat over-subtle presentation and would not be understood if the
            declaration was published. He repeated that he intended to discuss it with the Secretary
            in London.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> said that the French were anxious not to
            have this declaration come out on the 8th and they thought it would be just as valuable
            next week as this week. He also told me in confidence that he himself had personally

            statement we were now discussing. If, however, the Germans felt a Three-Power
            declaration to be important, we would try to get one.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister said he had had no recent contact on the matter with the French
            and had no indication of what their present ideas are. The Germans for their part have
            no suggestions to put forward. If the French wished to talk about a statement tonight,
            the Germans would not object since there still would be at least some value to a
            Three-Power declaration. If on the other hand the French showed no desire to continue
            the discussions, then we should stand on what we already have and put the question of a
            Three-Power statement off to some later and more appropriate time.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister said that in view of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName>'s presence, he wished to make one further point: As far as the
            Germans were concerned, there had never been a situation where they felt they had
            reached full agreement with the French in the Ambassadorial Group on the basis of the
            French proposal. The Germans had welcomed the American draft when circulated. They were
            also glad to receive the French draft but they had never identified themselves with it.
            The Germans had fully supported the additional sentence proposed by the Americans which
            stressed Four-Power responsibility for the German problem and also the intention to
            continue to work actively for reunification. They did not wish to get into the position
            with the French of putting up a solid front against the Americans. He added that with
            regard to the idea of “Europeanizing” the German problem, no one could be more critical
            of this concept than he was himself.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> commented that the Germans
            had in fact put one specific formula to the French (that the phrase “of all European
            peoples as well as other peoples concerned” be substituted for the words “of all the
            peoples of Europe” at the end of the final sentence of paragraph 3 of the French
            draft).</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister Schroeder agreed but said that he was not personally very fond of this
            suggestion. The French had not yet replied to it. It took away only a little bit of the
            concept of “Europeanization,” which he reiterated he found a very dangerous idea. It
            corresponded to the concepts put forth recently by <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>. He asked, “Where would this lead if we have to talk with people
            who are not in the least prepared to change the status quo?” He feared it would result
            in the Germans having to make all concessions in advance while leaving Germany still
            divided.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> said that for our part we
            were prepared to accept any of four different variations in the text. Three of them had
            already <pb n="266" xml:id="pg_266" facs="0296"/>been advanced in the Ambassadorial
            Group; the fourth was the one put by the Germans to the French, to which no reply had
            been received. It would be a pity if we were not able to reach agreement on a
            Three-Power declaration or at least on a passage on Germany in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> communiqué.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary commented that the two things were not quite the same. He tended to
            share Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName>'s reluctance to let the
            matter lie. It had become public knowledge that there has been an argument over this
            issue. An article in Le Monde this morning had referred to this as a reflection of
            further deterioration in US-French relations. If no agreement were reached now it would
            give the public impression of a greater amount of disagreement than probably in fact
            exists.</p>
                    <p>Schroeder repeated that the German point of view was to wonder about the utility of a
            Three-Power declaration which would be weaker than the statements already made. He was
            not particularly enthusiastic over this prospect. He said the real question was who was
            to take the initiative. The Germans would prefer to leave this to the French. The latter
            were not very happy over the situation in which they found themselves; this had been
            aggravated by pointed criticism in the German press over the French failure to make any
            statement on Germany on May 5. Maybe it would be possible to find a middle ground. This
            would be along the line that if there were no Three-Power declaration a statement could
            be included in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> communiqué, similar to that
            worked out at The Hague last year, which would stress Four-Power responsibility for
            Germany and the need for German reunification.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary suggested we leave it this way: Wait to see if the French take an
            initiative looking to a satisfactory agreement on a Three-Power declaration. Should they
            do so, we would go along. If they did not, we would have a statement on Germany in the
            communiqué.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>The Under Secretary opened the discussions by asking what subjects the others wished to
            discuss. Minister Schroeder suggested three subjects: the situation in the Ambassadorial
            Group; the question of Berlin clauses included in agreements or treaties entered into by
            the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>; and trade relations of Western countries with
            the Soviet zone of Germany.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the first of these three questions, Minister Schroeder noted that there
            was no agreement within the Ambassadorial Group on a Tripartite declaration on Germany.
            He also referred to the fact that various proposals regarding Germany had previously
            been tabled in the Ambassadorial Group and were still before that Group. Schroeder said
            the question arises as to whether we should discuss the Tripartite declaration in this
            evening's meeting. He said that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> had already
            indicated that it could agree to various compromise formulae which had been
            suggested.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> said that the United States
            could accept certain modifications in the final sentence of paragraph 3 of the French
            draft <pb n="268" xml:id="pg_268" facs="0298"/>or could agree to drop the final sentence
            of paragraph 3 and the U.S. proposed sentence.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary said that it seemed to him that we were close enough on a text so
            that we should be able to arrive at agreement.</p>
                    <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> said that he had no difficulty
            with amending the final sentence of paragraph 3 of the French draft to read: “of all
            European peoples as well as other peoples concerned” rather than “of all the peoples of
            Europe.”</p>
                    <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_SM12">Stewart</persName> asked the deletion of the words
            “in conformity with the principles of international law” in paragraph 3 arguing that
            self-determination does not really exist as a principle of international law.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary added quickly, “Notwithstanding the fact that international law
            itself doesn't exist!”</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> suggested that the word
            “assuring” be used in paragraph 4 rather than the word “guaranteeing.” There was no
            objection to either the compromise language which <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> said he could support at the end of paragraph 3 or to the
            suggestions of Minister Stewart re deletion of the phrase “in conformity with the
            principles of international law” or to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName>'s suggestion that the word “assuring” be used rather than
            “guaranteeing.”</p>
                    <p>Since there seemed to be full agreement on the text, the Under Secretary read it aloud
            and there was full agreement. (See Secun #9 for Text.)<note n="2" xml:id="d111fn2">Secun
              9, May 11, reported on the Quadripartite meeting on Berlin. (Ibid., Conference Files:

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> suggested that the best time
            for the publication of the text might be the afternoon of May 12 or on the morning of
            May 13 so that it could be endorsed in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
            communiqué on May 13.<note n="3" xml:id="d111fn3">For text, including the annex on
              Germany, see Department of State Bulletin, June 7, 1965, pp. 926–928.</note> He
            suggested that Minister <persName corresp="#p_SM12">Stewart</persName> present the text
            at the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Ministerial meeting the morning of May 11.
            The others present at the meeting agreed that this procedure would be good.</p>
                    <p>Although Schroeder went on to say that perhaps publication of the Three-Power
            declaration should be delayed until after the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
            communiqué, <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> felt that prior publication and
            a reference in the communiqué to the declaration would be the best way of handling it.
            Schroeder said the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Ministerial meeting could “take
            note of” or “endorse” the Three-Power declaration.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> referred to the sensitivity of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> partners and the need to inform them. Ambassador
              <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> reiterated the desirability of
            releasing the text the afternoon of May 12 and then picking up reference to it in the
            communiqué. The Under Secretary suggested that it be provisionally <pb n="269" xml:id="pg_269" facs="0299"/>agreed to publish the text on the afternoon of May 12.
            The Under Secretary emphasized that nothing should be said to the press other than the
            usual bland statement.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> wondered what the word
            “indefinitely” meant in the last sentence of the declaration. He wondered if it meant
            “Bis auf unbe-stimmte Zeit.” There was general agreement that this was a satisfactory
            translation of the word “indefinite.”</p>
                    <p>Schroeder suggested looking at the communiqué issued at The Hague on May 15, 1964<note n="4" xml:id="d111fn4">For text, see ibid., June 1, 1964, p. 850.</note> which could
            perhaps serve as a guide for us this time. He thought that there should be mention in
            the communiqué of the declaration. Minister <persName corresp="#p_SM12">Stewart</persName> thought that perhaps working level people of the Four at the
            meeting this evening could meet, following the discussions in the Ministerial meeting
            tomorrow morning, and draft a formula for <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
            communiqué language.</p>
                    <p>Schroeder said that if the discussion on the declaration was completed, he wished to
            note that there were some proposals still before the Ambassadorial Group which had been
            tabled earlier. He said he would not have anything new to add to these proposals at this
            time.</p>
                    <p>Minister Schroeder then turned to the second large subject which he had suggested for
            discussion this evening, namely Berlin clauses in <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
            treaties. Schroeder referred specifically to the problems which had been encountered by
            the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> in negotiating trade treaties with Eastern
            European countries. Treaties had already been entered into with Berlin clauses included,
            with Hungary, Poland, Rumania and Bulgaria. At the time these come up for extension, the
            question of a Berlin clause will again arise. Negotiations are presently pending for
            trade agreements with Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union. Every time a Berlin clause is
            included in an <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> treaty, positive action is required
            by the Allied Kommandatura before the treaty becomes applicable to Berlin. Schroeder now
            wished to suggest a change in procedure from a “positive” to a “negative” Berlin clause
            whereby Berlin would be automatically included in <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
            treaties unless the Allies took specific action to prevent this from happening. He
            stated that opposition from Pankow to Berlin clauses will continue but we should not let
            this deter us. In its relations with Eastern Europe it will be important for the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> to include Berlin and a “negative” Berlin clause was
            preferable to a “positive” one.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary wondered whether this was meant to include all treaties or just
            trade agreements with Eastern Europe. Schroeder responded that all treaties could
            perhaps be included but that one can consider whether all treaties should have negative
            clauses or not. It would be <pb n="270" xml:id="pg_270" facs="0300"/>difficult to
            determine right now to which ones a negative clause would be applicable and to which
            ones it would not be applicable.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary said we would want to study the question carefully. The
            implications of the proposal might go beyond the immediate question of trade agreements.
            It raises difficult questions. He did not think we could get a consensus on the general
            concept. The inconven-ience presently imposed by the existing procedure on Berlin
            clauses is not great.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SM12">Stewart</persName> pointed to difficulties with the proposal
            of Schroeder, including the difficulty of indicating publicly that Berlin is simply to
            be regarded as a part of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> as far as the treaties
            are concerned. Schroeder said he did not wish to suggest any change in the legal
            situation. It is only that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> is faced with certain
            practical difficulties regarding Berlin. He said the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
            could draft a paper and submit it to the Western Three so that they could consider the
            matter further. What is involved here are fundamental problems of relations with Eastern
            Europe and the Soviet Union. <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> expressed some
            general reservations regarding Schroe-der's proposal, but agreed the matter could be
            studied further.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRC1">Creel</persName> recalled the difficult problems of a
            legal character which had been involved in 1952 in working out existing procedures for
            applying <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> treaties to Berlin.<note n="5" xml:id="d111fn5">For texts of the declarations governing the relationship, see
              Documents on Germany, 1944–1985, pp. 379–383.</note> He recalled his personal
            involvement in the efforts to arrive at an agreed formulation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRC1">Creel</persName> suggested that the Germans formulate their ideas in
            writing and with some specificity so that we could see precisely what types of treaties
            are involved. Schroeder said that the Germans would do so and have a memorandum on the
            subject at a later date. He suggested that the problem might be examined in the first
            instance by the Ambassadors in Bonn. The others present agreed to this suggestion.</p>
                    <p>Schroeder then turned to the third subject he had mentioned earlier, namely, commercial
            relations of the Western Powers with the Soviet zone of Germany. He emphasized strongly
            that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> is not afraid of competition of Western
            trade with the zone. However, trade increases the status of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and the more Western countries move into that market, the less the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> is dependent on the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>.
            Interzonal trade rests on the fundamental principle of making East Germany dependent on
            West Germany. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> regards <gloss target="#t_IZT1">IZT</gloss> as domestic trade. <gloss target="#t_IZT1">IZT</gloss> is an instrument
            to be used to insure access to Berlin.</p>
                    <p>Schroeder complained particularly about Western exports of machine tools and
            electro-technical equipment and also about credit guarantees by Western governments for
            trade with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. He said that <pb n="271" xml:id="pg_271" facs="0301"/>machine tools and electro-technical equipment traded by
            other Western countries is almost equal to the volume of trade of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> with the zone in such goods. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> is concerned for political, not economic, reasons about the rising trend
            of increased trade by Western countries with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. He
            did not have any particular objections to privately financed trade but credit guarantees
            by governments are very objectionable. There is a great difference between trade with
            the zone and trade with Eastern European countries. Total Western trade amounts to
            $70,000,000. US trade in 1964 amounted to $24,000,000, and for the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> it was $37,000,000.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary said that as far as he knew there were no US Government guarantees
            for exports to the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. A great proportion of US exports
            to the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> in 1964 was from wheat sales. <persName corresp="#p_SM12">Stewart</persName> said he thought that <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> sales in the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> had decreased over the
            past three years. Schroeder said it is the trend that is important. If we are not
            careful we will quickly reach the point where <gloss target="#t_IZT1">IZT</gloss> will
            lose its significance and the East Germans will cease to be dependent on West Germany.
            It is true there has been an increase in Western German trade recently with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> but the fact that there has been an increase is not the
            real point that we are dealing with. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> wants the
              <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> to continue to be interested in those areas where
            they will be most dependent on the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> takes certain goods from the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> that the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> would otherwise have great
            difficulty in disposing of.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary referred to the Miller Committee<note n="6" xml:id="d111fn6">Reference is to the Special Committee on U.S. Trade Relations with Eastern European
              Countries and the Soviet Union, chaired by Irwin Miller, Chairman of the Board of
              Cummins Engine Company.</note> report which will be taken into consideration in the
            formulation of legislation regarding trade with Eastern Europe. He noted that we have
            always differentiated in trade with the zone and the rest of Eastern Europe. We have no
            intention of changing our basic policy through increasing our trade with the zone.
            Further, we have no intention of extending government credits to cover zonal trade.</p>
                    <p>Schroeder said there were advantages of a common strategy vis-à-vis the zone in this
            matter. The zone for its part tends to play various Western countries against each
            other. What we need is “contingency planning” in this field. <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> asked if Schroeder was suggesting bilateral discussions or talks in
            some other form. Schroeder answered that it was perhaps useful to have discussions on a
            Four-Power level. <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> trade with the zone has been
            gradually increasing.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary thought that, since quite a number of Western countries are
            involved in trade with East Germany, we should perhaps consider discussing the question
            in a forum larger than a quadripartite group. Schroeder responded that the Western Three
            Powers, because of <pb n="272" xml:id="pg_272" facs="0302"/>their special
            responsibilities for Berlin and its access as well as Germany, had a closer connection
            to the problem. Therefore, quadripartite discussions were preferable. He felt that other
            members of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> would be interested in whatever was
            worked out with those powers with special responsibilities in Germany.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary thought there was not much point in getting the agreement of the
            Four if other countries are going to increase their trade sharply with East Germany. The
            United States is very much aware of the problems involved in efforts to restrict trade
            since we have had our experience, which has not been entirely pleasant, with trying to
            restrict trade with certain countries ourselves and found subsequently that others had
            increased their trade with the countries in question while we were limiting ours.</p>
                    <p>Schroeder said he knew of our experiences in this field but in dealing with the East
            Germans we are dealing with a very limited subject. Stewart thought there would be
            considerable difficulty in working out a common line on this question. In any case, he
            had the impression British trade was lower than it was three years ago. Schroeder said
            that in 1964 the British figures were slightly above the 1962 figures.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary said the United States is already following the policy which is now
            advocated by Schroeder. We would not object, however, to quadripartite discussions, or
            larger discussions if they were deemed preferable. <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> said that he would be prepared for bilateral discussions,
            quadripartite discussions, or larger discussions if they were desired. <persName corresp="#p_SM12">Stewart</persName> did not object to quadripartite discussions but
            said we will have to work at the question from the standpoint of our trade position.
            Schroeder suggested that quadripartite discussions take place in Bonn and this
            suggestion was agreed to by the other participants in this evening's meeting. In
            response to a question by <persName corresp="#p_SM12">Stewart</persName>, Schroeder
            agreed that Western German trade with the zone could also be discussed in such
            talks.</p>
                    <p>Schroeder expressed appreciation for the relative speed with which the questions he had
            raised this evening were dealt with.</p>
                    <p>It was agreed that the press guidance regarding this evening's meeting would be along
            the following lines: We discussed certain Berlin and German questions. Foreign Minister
              <persName corresp="#p_SM12">Stewart</persName> will report at the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Ministerial meeting on May 11.</p>

                    <p>4633. Ref: Embtel 4626.<note n="2" xml:id="d112fn2">Telegram 4626 from Bonn, May 22,
              reported on the issues <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> wished to
              discuss with President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>. (Ibid.)</note>
            Subj: <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> visit—political topics. In my
            meeting with him on May 21 (Embtel 4626), the Chancellor indicated a number of topics
            which he wished to discuss in Washington. From what I know of the arrangements, time
            will probably preclude the discussion of all of these subjects between the President and
            the Chancellor even though this is the Chancellor's desire. If there is not time some of
            the topics might appropriately be discussed between the Secretary and <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>, or the Secretary and <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> Schroeder, if they hold separate conversations, or with State
            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName>.</p>
                    <p>I recommend that we attempt to focus the bulk of the conversation between the President
            and the Chancellor on certain major topics of broad mutual interest, namely,
            Franco-German relations, European unity, German reunification, the future of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, and economic relations.</p>
                    <p>In general, these are the topics in para (1) of the reftel.<note n="3" xml:id="d112fn3">These topics were: “The current French attitude,” French-Soviet relations, the Common
              Market, <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, and “recent change in the Soviet
              attitude.”</note> The topics in paras 2 and 3<note n="4" xml:id="d112fn4">These were:
              the Middle East, India, Pakistan, and China.</note> should be subordinated, if indeed
            time permits their consideration. We should accommodate the Chancellor's wish for a
            statement of our attitude about the situation in Viet Nam and draw him out as to what
            increased support he is willing to provide on the non-military side. His support for our
            position can be helpful in any public statement after the talks.</p>
                    <p>Comments on Franco-German relations, European unity, and German reunification are
            contained in this message. Separate messages are devoted to the defense and economic
            items.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. Franco-German relations.</p>
                    <p>Of all the subjects proposed by the German side, none to my knowledge is more crucial
            at this time than the future course of action we should both take with regard to
              <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>. As the Department is aware, the
            problem of Gaullism in Germany has been as much a question of internal politics within
            the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_CSU1">CSU</gloss> as of
            foreign relations strictly speaking. Because of this, there are still voices heard in
            Germany which maintain that the policy of deference to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName> has been proved all the <pb n="274" xml:id="pg_274" facs="0304"/>more correct by recent developments. Those who follow this line maintain that it is
            only because the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> has been willing to go along with
            those who would frustrate <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>, that he has
            taken a direction which seems more dangerous in German eyes. In particular his
            flirtation with the Soviets, which has worried even such a staunch advocate of close
            ties with France as <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>, is cited as
            evidence. This is not a majority view, but is held by a number of publicists and
            politicians. Their conclusion is that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>'s
            recent actions (the “Europeanization” of reunification, the move toward the Soviets, the
            implied threat to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, etc.) make it all the more
            important to draw closer to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> in the
            future. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> will undoubtedly do all he can
            to stimulate this view during his visit here next month.</p>
                    <p>In spite of this view, which cannot be disregarded even though held by only a minority,
            I feel that there is a more important segment of German official and public opinion who
            have reached what might be termed a “watershed” in their thinking about <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>. This group includes Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> and <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>
            Schroeder themselves. Schroeder told me recently, as reported in Embtel 4348,<note n="5" xml:id="d112fn5">See <ref target="#d108fn2">footnote 2, Document 108</ref>.</note>
            that many of his adversaries were beginning to admit that he had been right about
              <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> all the time. It is believed to be
            symptomatic, for example, that such an influential paper as Die Welt said recently that
              “<persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> has destroyed two of the main bases
            on which the Franco-German Treaty rests—the understanding that the FedRep would not
            return to Rapallo, and that France would not return to a policy of encirclement.”</p>
                    <p>The domestic political considerations which have limited the freedom with which
              <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> and Schroeder could handle relations
            with Paris may be in the process of becoming less significant as disillusion with
              <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> grows. This being so, I feel that the
            degree of firmness we could expect from the Germans in any post-electoral confrontation
            with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> will depend in large part on our
            willingness to take a strong lead. We should make clear to <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> and Schroeder, before the German leaders begin to formulate any new
            policy, that we are if necessary prepared, albeit reluctantly, to move ahead with
            Germany and other countries which may be so disposed, toward common goals even without
            France. We shall need to show that the Germans have an alternative to catering to
            France, and that alternative may well offer the best means of bringing France back into
            the fold, even if fairly rough sledding must be expected in the short run. We do not
            seek confrontations with France for their own sake, but in order to accomplish pressing
              <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and other business which cannot await his
            retirement from the scene. It is hard to see how we could really offer Germany any kind
            of European unity without France; but we can offer the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> continued security in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> (which can
            still be effective <pb n="275" xml:id="pg_275" facs="0305"/>even without France) and an
            honorable role as partner and ally in constructive Free World endeavors. We could
            suggest that the time may have come for the two of us quietly to think out together how
            to proceed in the event France withdraws from <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. If
            effective planning is begun, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> can gain
            less leverage from threats to withdraw.</p>
                    <p>If the above points are made to the Chancellor during his Washington visit, they should
            serve to strengthen him in his meeting with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName> the following week.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Reunification.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor is not likely to put forward any new proposals in this area. Although
            the Chancellor like other German political leaders must give constant public evidence of
            interest and maximum efforts to obtain progress, essentially the Germans are not
            interested in defining their negotiation positions until there is some indication that
            the Soviets are prepared to enter serious negotiations. They recognize that this
            condition is not likely to prevail for some time to come. Nonetheless the Chancellor
            will certainly wish to be in a position to say that he raised the German question and
            that the two governments are in close agreement on the need for reunification.</p>
                    <p>He can be expected to express appreciation for the President's May 5 letter to
            President Luebke and May 7 speech and to indicate the importance he attributes to
            continuing Four-Power responsibility for a German solution. He may ask for continuing US
            support in combatting Soviet efforts to enhance the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
            and perpetuate the status quo.</p>
                    <p>We believe it would be desirable to state forcefully that the US has no intention of
            relinquishing its responsibilities in Germany; that we recognize the legitimate
            European-wide interest in a German settlement, but we cannot and will not accept any
            watering down of the special responsibilities borne by the Four Powers alone. In
            reassuring the Chancellor of our support vis-à-vis the Soviets, it might be well to
            caution against steps on the German part to change the status quo in Berlin or moves of
            a purely demonstrative nature which could induce strong Soviet reactions. It would be
            awkward for both of us if we were forced to choose between seeming to oppose the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> or seeing some aspect of our position in Berlin
            jeopardized. Both of us can only lose from such a situation.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. Soviet relations.</p>
                    <p>The state of Soviet/<gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> relations has seldom been less
            promising than at the present. Moscow has taken every available opportunity recently to
            attack the <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> and <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> has rebuffed the Chancellor's invitation to visit Bonn. This
            attitude is a concomitant of the Soviet determination to make the division of Germany as
            permanent as possible and is, in the foreseeable future, likely to continue. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>'s only hope for improving relations lies in the trade
            field where the Germans have some leverage. Under the circumstances, the Chancellor will
            probably be <pb n="276" xml:id="pg_276" facs="0306"/>mainly interested in the
            President's assessment of current Soviet overall intentions, and his estimate of the
            present Soviet leadership.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">4. European unity.</p>
                    <p>Despite <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>'s clearly negative attitude
            toward European political integration, Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> continues to seek at least an appearance of progress toward unity.
            He has pushed for a meeting of <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> heads of govt and now
            has a “step by step” plan for European unity. As of now there appears to be little new
            or substantive beneath the Chancellor's public efforts. It is doubtful whether he will
            have any new approach to outline to the President. He will be looking mainly for
            encouragement and support. He undoubtedly recognizes that the prospects of progress on
            political unity are dim at present. It is understood that <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> during their
            June meeting will agree to postpone the heads of govt meeting until after September,
            since otherwise <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> might well be confronted
            with a failure just before the elections.</p>
                    <p>The Germans are not interested in an integrated European defense policy as proposed by
              <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>, so there can be no forward movement
            in this area. Only in the economic field is the process of European integration moving
            ahead.</p>
                    <p>In responding to <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> on this subject we
            should, as in the past, express strong support for an integrated Europe as a partner in
            the Atlantic Alliance. The Chancellor can rely on our support in his efforts toward this
            goal. We should stress, however, that it is the Europeans themselves who must take the
            lead.</p>

                    <p rend="center">CHANGE IN EAST GERMANY</p>
                    <p>A kind of ersatz stability has been growing in the Soviet Zone, the so-called German
            Democratic Republic (<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>) during the last three <pb n="277" xml:id="pg_277" facs="0307"/>years. Erection of the Berlin Wall in August 1961
            was the turning point that forced the East German people to accommodate to <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Walter Ulbricht</persName>'s regime. From this accommodation, the
            regime has gained enough security and self-confidence to enable it to satisfy pressures
            both from the outside and within for some relaxation of domestic policies and a general
            overhaul of the country's economy. With these developments a sense of national
            self-interest has begun to evolve. While the regime has as yet had no cause to regret
            these changes, it is still too early to be confident that it will not backtrack.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Popular Attitudes</p>
                    <p>The majority of East Germans remain anti-Communist but with decreasing emotionalism.
            The popular temper is no longer one of the potential revolt. Many of the really
            dissatisfied East Germans fled through the open Berlin border before the Wall closed in
            mid-August 1961. Among those who remain, there is a general attitude of acquiescence
            encouraged by the presence of 20 Soviet divisions, by the efficiency of the security
            apparatus, and by a few key concessions granted in the last year or so.</p>
                    <p>This new attitude is reflected in the slow but steady rise in the levels of economic
            productivity, and in a general decrease in the incidence of barn burnings and industrial
            sabotage. It is also illustrated in the surprisingly small number of pension-age East
            Germans who have opted to remain in the West since the regime began allowing them to
            visit relatives in West Berlin and West Germany last November.</p>
                    <p>With the relaxation of domestic tensions, East Germans have come to express their
            complaints openly. These center on the lack of personal freedoms—particularly the
            freedom to travel—a sense of being cut off from developments elsewhere in Europe, and
            the disparity between their standard of living and that of the West Germans. Even
            rank-and-file party members feel free to criticize and frequently deride official
            explanations of foreign and domestic political developments.</p>
                    <p>The regime's most significant shortcoming in the eyes of the people—a liability also
            recognized by the leadership—is its character as an unpopularly elected government
            running an artificially created portion of a Greater Germany. In a “poll” last December
            the central committee found that the people generally do not support or understand the
            party's ideological and political policies, particularly with regard to West Germany. To
            meet this problem, propaganda techniques were revamped.</p>
                    <p>Only the youngest generation, however, is likely to respond positively to the new
            approach. A poll conducted by the West Berlin Senat after the first Christmas Pass
            period reflected the first signs of a sense of national identity and consciousness among
            East German youth. To cultivate <pb n="278" xml:id="pg_278" facs="0308"/>such sentiments
            the regime sponsored a nationwide youth convocation last May—the first of its kind in
            ten years.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Economic Reforms</p>
                    <p>Recent reforms in the economy grew out of the failure of earlier, quite unrealistic
            plans to “overtake and surpass” West Germany. Retrenchment brought obvious benefits in
            1963–1964, reducing the backlog of unfinished investment projects, ending foreign trade
            deficits, and greatly easing inflationary pressures in the consumer market.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> pushed the development
            of a new program to create popular confidence and to reassert a sense of purpose, the
            so-called “new economic system of planning and management.” <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> set out to win over the technical elite—engineers, economists,
            and executives—who previously had been ignored by his planners and alienated by his
            economic policies. He offered them increased responsibility and greater incentives and,
            with their support, proposed to test the idea that the productive techniques of Western
            management can be blended into a planned economy.</p>
                    <p>The introduction of the “new economic system” began with the reorganization of the
            industrial associations into super-enterprises somewhat resembling major subsidiaries of
            a large Western corporation. Reforms in prices, planning, and banking are being
            introduced in stages. The “new economic system” has brought administrative order into
            the East German economy and seems to be working fairly well. But without more basic
            reforms it is unlikely to lead to any significant increase in the presently
            disappointing rate of economic growth.</p>
                    <p>Economic retrenchment and reform, however, have given some relief and encouragement to
            the long-suffering population. The process of easing inflation was painful—wage cuts and
            price increases for consumer goods—but produced welcome results. Daily necessities now
            can be bought without queuing and are generally affordable. There is renewed hope of
            further improvement in living conditions.</p>
                    <p>The regime has promised to improve the quality and assortment of consumer goods and the
            availability of services, and the first results have begun to appear, although the
            consumer is still far from satisfied. Without promising, the regime has also encouraged
            the people to look forward to a five-day work week within the next few years. As a
            result, although East Germans have no prospect of “catching up with” West Germans, they
            are conscious of being better off than at any time since World War II.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Travel Reforms</p>
                    <p>The regime has also taken the first steps toward alleviating the people's sense of
            isolation. Since last November, pension-age East Germans <pb n="279" xml:id="pg_279" facs="0309"/>(65 for men, 60 for women) have been permitted to visit relatives in West
            Berlin or West Germany for up to four weeks a year. Three million of East Germany's 17
            million people are eligible for these visits, and 1.5 million are expected to take
            advantage of the opportunity. Under the Berlin pass agreement, arranged initially for
            Christmas 1963 and renewed in 1964, West Berliners may make four one-day visits to
            relatives in East Berlin each year.</p>
                    <p>While the East Germans welcomed these programs, they were critical over the requirement
            that Berlin pass visitors must exchange a minimum amount of currency at an artificially
            low rate, and that pensioners must not accept the West German Government's grant-in-aid
            of 50 deutschemarks. These programs have increased popular pressures to further widen
            travel privileges.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Juridical Reforms</p>
                    <p>The regime also is trying to soften its reputation for hard-fisted justice by
            emphasizing “corrective treatment,” imposing generally milder sentences, and resorting
            in many instances to restrictive measures short of imprisonment.</p>
                    <p>Last October, <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> announced the regime's
            first large-scale amnesty which freed some 10,000 political and common criminals over a
            two-month period.</p>
                    <p>Before the amnesty, between July and September 1964, West Germany had been allowed to
            ransom between 800 and 1,000 political prisoners for payments in goods and cash. Another
            release-for-ransom deal involving 1,000 prisoners is currently under way.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Policy Toward Intellectuals</p>
                    <p>The regime's cultural policies have been ambivalent. Some of Kafka's works, once all
            banned, now are being published, partially in response to pressures from other Eastern
            European countries. Writers denied publication only a year ago now appear occasionally
            in the regime-controlled press, receive official recognition for controversial works,
            and are permitted to lecture publicly—even traveling to West Berlin to do so.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, the regime has been fighting a rear-guard action to prevent artists
            and intellectuals from challenging the basic tenets of Marxism-Leninism or its
            self-appointed role as cultural arbiter. Last April, Ulbricht convoked the Second
            Bitterfeld Conference for the purpose of urging a return to “socialist realism” under
            regime guidance. Addressing the party plenum last December, ideologist Kurt Hager
            sternly warned that the regime would not permit the watering down of its cultural
            policies at the behest of “revisionists” inside or outside the bloc, and that “bourgeois
            decadence and abstractionism” would not be tolerated.</p>
                    <pb n="280" xml:id="pg_280" facs="0310"/>
                    <p>The case of <persName>Robert Havemann</persName>, a professor at Humboldt University,
            illustrates the regime's ambivalent policy. A year ago he was ousted from the party and
            fired from the university for lecturing on the necessity of liberalizing Communism. In
            December, he was interviewed by a Western journalist, presumably with official
            knowledge. The interview, published in the West German weekly Der Spiegel under the
            title “Marxism Suffers From Sclerosis,” urged fewer controls and claimed that the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> had far to go in de-Stalinization. Nonetheless, he has
            not been imprisoned and is still allowed occasional contacts with foreigners.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Religious Policy</p>
                    <p>The regime has struck a bargain with the Evangelical Church, the major religious faith
            in East Germany. The basis of understanding is that organized religion will not be
            harassed if the clergy supports the regime's political goals.</p>
                    <p>After quiet and delicate negotiations last spring the regime released imprisoned
            clergymen. West Berlin Bishop Dibelius announced in October that, for the first time
            since 1933, no pastors were in prison anywhere in Germany. Church officials also report
            a rise in the number of baptisms, confirmations, and marriages, and a concomitant
            decline in the number of people apostatizing and undergoing secular regime-sponsored
            confirmations. The regime also is permitting church-oriented convocations, and allowing
            clergymen to travel abroad to international meetings such as Vatican II and the recent
            Pacem in Terris conference in New York.<note n="2" xml:id="d113fn2">May 21.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>A significant concession to private conscience was the creation last fall of labor
            battalions—unique in Eastern Europe—in which conscientious objectors could fulfill their
            military service obligation. The number of conscientious objectors now reportedly
            exceeds the total in West Germany.</p>
                    <p>Of course, the situation is still not ideal from the church's point of view. The six
            theological faculties and three church training centers provide too few graduates—about
            85 a year—to staff the country's 4,500 pastorates. In the Saxony church district, for
            example, only 1,000 of the 1,350 pastoral offices are filled. Bishop Dibelius has warned
            that it would be “pure nonsense” to assume that the regime had embarked on a
            liberalization process.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Party</p>
                    <p>In the last 15 months, Ulbricht has further rehabilitated and in some cases readmitted
            to party membership many of his real or imagined opponents of the past. These include
            former politburo member Paul Merker, former justice minister Max Fechner, “revisionist”
            economists Fritz Behrens and Arne Benary, and ideologue Wolfgang Harich.</p>
                    <pb n="281" xml:id="pg_281" facs="0311"/>
                    <p>The East German people probably are not convinced by the regime's continually expressed
            intentions to liberalize domestic policies, even though there are signs that this time
            the leadership means it. Rather surprisingly, <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> referred favorably on two occasions in the last six months to the
            controversial critique of Soviet-directed Communism by the late Italian Communist
            leader, Palmiro Togliatti.<note n="3" xml:id="d113fn3">Reference is to the so-called
              Yalta Memorandum, August 1964. For text, see William E. Griffith (ed.), Sino-Soviet
              Relations, 1964–1965 (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1967), pp.
              373–383.</note> A dominant theme at the December plenum of the central committee and
            in the subsequent lower level party elections was that officials must be more
            sympathetic and responsive to popular opinion.</p>
                    <p>The party is faced with the necessity of attracting technocrats into its ranks to help
            with economic reform. However, their admission—many of them are opportunistically rather
            than ideologically motivated—causes strains with the older generation of orthodox,
            militant Communist functionaries.</p>
                    <p>For the moment the basic power structure remains unchanged. Personal antagonisms among
            the top leaders are kept in check by the dominating figure of <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>. Since the Wall, the aging first secretary has become something
            of an “elder statesman,” a court of last resort, and has delegated more and more of his
            responsibilities to others. Relatively young experts like Guenter Mittag and Erich Apel
            exercise the power of immediate decision. Erich Honecker appears to run party affairs on
            a day-to-day basis as <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>'s undisputed deputy
            there. More recently, he also seems to have handled some governmental matters, normally
            the prerogative of Premier <persName corresp="#p_SW6">Willi Stoph</persName>, who
            after achieving that office last September suffered a period of eclipse until May Day
            this year.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Reasons for the Reforms</p>
                    <p>Pressures on <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> to institute the past
            year's reforms have come not only from inside the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
            but also from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the East European countries.
            He had long been able to evade de-Stalinization by pleading that East Germany's exposed
            position on the bloc's western frontier demanded a garrison-state atmosphere. As a
            result, East Germany and its party were more and more turning into Stalinist fossils and
            becoming a source of general embarrassment to the bloc.</p>
                    <p>East Germany's vulnerable position was brought home to <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> when the loosening of intrabloc ties revealed an increasing
            willingness on the part of brother satellites to ignore East German state interests.
            Poland, Rumania, Bulgaria, and Hungary in the last two years have signed trade
            agreements with West Germany that include West Berlin, which East Germany considers a
            separate political entity. There is some evidence <pb n="282" xml:id="pg_282" facs="0312"/>that Pankow fears that Moscow might ultimately make a deal with the West
            at East Germany's expense.</p>
                    <p>The reforms are intended to improve East Germany's initiatives abroad. The economic
            reforms are also intended to make East Germany more competitive in foreign markets, both
            in the bloc and in the West by upgrading products and modernizing business methods.
            Steady progress is required if East Germany is even to hold its own in today's
            markets.</p>
                    <p>The reform program also is closely linked to the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>'s
            policy toward West Germany. For example, Pankow portrays the Berlin pass agreement,
            signed with the West Berlin Senat, as supporting the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
            contention that West Berlin is a separate political unit—one of the three German states,
            which can and must learn to work amicably with each other. Ultimately, the reforms seem
            designed to help establish an atmosphere conducive to direct East-West German
            negotiations and to take advantage of West Berlin Mayor Brandt's view that West Germany
            can ameliorate living conditions for the East German people in exchange for economic
            concessions.</p>
                    <p>From the standpoint of its internal policies, the <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> regime apparently hopes that a measured degree of unorthodoxy and
            flexibility will enable it to win popular commitment to its objectives. The reforms so
            far enacted, however, have not greatly affected the lives of most East Germans. Their
            loyalties are still doubtful. But for the relatively few—e.g., factory managers and farm
            chairmen—whose support in the first instance is necessary, new incentives should prove
            efficacious.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Prospects</p>
                    <p>The reforms suggest that, even as elsewhere in Eastern Europe, a new and more realistic
            element of national self-interest is affecting East German policy. Responding primarily
            to pressures from the Soviet bloc, East Germany has embarked on a new course.</p>
                    <p>While there has been no retreat since <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>'s ouster, neither have there been new concessions. The regime now
            appears to be marking time, assessing the results so far. The central committee plenums
            in December and April were distinguished by an undertone of caution in all but economic
            policies. It appears doubtful that <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> will
            carry through his promise to add duplicate candidates to electoral lists this year, to
            increase pensions, or to lengthen vacations.</p>
                    <p>However, the future of the present trend is not assured. There are strong conservative
            forces within the party opposing even those reforms already granted. There are several
            reports, for example, that the Ministry for State Security bitterly opposes the Berlin
            pass agreement and the pensioner visits. <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>'s incapacitation or death could serve to spark a conservative
            resurgence.</p>

                    <p>Minister Schroeder said that closer ties between East and West are a value in
            themselves. They might not always have a direct bearing on progress towards
            reunification, but that objective is always in German thoughts.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> observed that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> thinks that only by economic and some other
            closer ties can the reunification of Germany be brought about.</p>
                    <p>Minister Schroeder suggested that in approaching the German question in the future, the
            United States and Germany should first explore the matter bilaterally. Then these
            discussions could be broadened to include the others.</p>
                    <p>Minister Schroeder added that the talks should be kept highly informal.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName> emphasized that they must
            be kept absolutely secret.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> asserted that any suggestions
            prepared for the group of powers should have substance.</p>
                    <p>Minister Schroeder pointed out that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> attitude
            towards the Four Powers has not changed. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> knows
            the prospect for reunification is not good now. The German position is to continue to
            rely on the Four Powers for the settlement of the German question but initially to
            discuss bilaterally what is possible.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said there should also be talks with
            the United Kingdom.</p>
                    <p>Minister Schroeder replied that he did not have exclusive talks in mind. The British
            could be included a little later.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>The Chancellor spoke of his pleasure at being here. He said that he was certain the
            Secretary knew how keenly he felt about the Alliance. He <pb n="285" xml:id="pg_285" facs="0315"/>referred to his upcoming talks with de Gaulle which he said would not be
            easy. They would concern not only the problems of the Six, but the problems of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. The Chancellor felt it was not necessary this morning
            to mention the German problem in particular. He was grateful, as the Secretary knew, for
            the recent statements by the President and other American leaders on the German
            problem.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor said he had one question he wished to explore with the Secretary. He
            stated that one heard a great deal today about the relations of the West with the
            countries of Eastern Europe. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>, according
            to the Chancellor, had described the solution to the German problem in terms of a better
            relationship between the East and West. The Chancellor said it was his view that the
            Eastern European countries had their own identity, were national states whether
            Communist or not and that they threatened the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> with
            giving equal treatment to the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. In the US, Chancellor
              <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> said one hears more and more that
            commercial relations with these Eastern European countries are useful. He referred to an
            article in Life by Professor Brzezinski.<note n="2" xml:id="d115fn2">Not found.</note>
            The Chancellor said the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> was not hostile toward the
            Eastern European countries, but it was premature to speculate regarding diplomatic
            relations between these countries and the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. He felt
            the time for such action was not opportune. He thought that in view of the rupture of
            relations caused with the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> by ten Arab states and the
            upcoming Algiers conference of Afro-Asian countries,<note n="3" xml:id="d115fn3">The
              Conference was held October 28–November 2. It ended without any agreements.</note> any
            speculation regarding the establishment of diplomatic relations between the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and the Eastern European countries would only create an
            atmosphere of uncertainty.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor asked if all Western European countries grant long term credits to the
            Eastern European states, what will be achieved? Are we not basically deceiving ourselves
            into thinking that we may achieve German reunification in this way? He felt it would be
            difficult to explain such actions to the German people. He thought that even when viewed
            from a long range point of view, it was necessary for us to proceed with great caution.
            If everybody gives long term credits to the Eastern European states, what will they do
            with these credits? Perhaps they will increase their armaments.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor asked if it was not to be expected that the Soviets would increase the
            pressure on the Eastern European countries as we are trying to develop better relations
            with them. The Chancellor asked, as an economist, when and under what conditions would
            these Eastern European countries be ready to repay the credits extended to them? He was
            concerned that the position of the creditors would in the last analysis be <pb n="286" xml:id="pg_286" facs="0316"/>worse than that of the debtors. We would be forced to
            continue giving them credit in the hope of getting repayment. He warned that we could
            not give them the impression that we are doing this as a gift. He voiced the necessity
            for the development of an economic strategy in this field, a strategy based on a study
            of the results achieved. He asked if granting credits has resulted in greater readiness
            to move away from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Had the chances for German
            reunification actually improved? Or are these Eastern European states making use of
            these funds to undermine the Western position? Were they financing armies of liberation
            in other parts of the world? He said he felt ill at ease at these thoughts.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary replied we saw considerable advantage in more relaxed relations between
            East and West Europe, including improved relations between the Federal Republic of
            Germany and the Communist states of Eastern Europe. He believed important developments
            were taking place in Eastern Europe. The smaller Eastern European countries have
            achieved a considerable degree of national autonomy. This is decidedly to our advantage.
            The Secretary felt there was underlying nostalgia in Eastern Europe for greater
            association with the West in the cultural, intellectual as well as other fields. The
            Secretary said the role of the US in such a policy toward Eastern Europe is fairly
            restricted. US trade with Eastern Europe is only a small fraction of Western European
            trade with that part of the world. It was not easy for us to change this situation.
            There was legislation governing our trade with Communist states. Congress would want to
            look with great care into any change of this situation. Moreover, the attitude of
            Eastern Europe toward us cannot help but be affected by developments in other parts of
            the world—in Viet-Nam and Cuba, for example. Some Eastern European countries, the
            Secretary suggested, may stand aside in conflicts involving us with the Communists in
            other parts of the world, but a crisis like that of Viet-Nam imposes inevitably
            limitations on us to improve the atmosphere, the relations between us and Eastern
            Europe.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary expressed his full agreement with the Chancellor on the problem of
            credits to the Communist Bloc. He said that we and the Federal Republic had tended to
            view the problem in the same light, but that we have often been disappointed by the
            positions taken by other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> powers. He felt it would
            be unfortunate if there developed in the West a policy of giving easy credit terms to
            Eastern Europe. He said when credits became aid, we were making a mistake in our
            priorities. We should obviously not increase the capacity of Communist strength until
            the prospects for much better relations with the Bloc looked brighter. The Secretary
            felt that the idea of a détente had gone far beyond the facts. He cited the nuclear test
            ban treaty as a stimulus to the notion that a détente had been reached. To prove that
            this was not so, he cited crises which had arisen since that time. He said there were
            indications the Soviets may <pb n="287" xml:id="pg_287" facs="0317"/>press us on Berlin
            again. He reminded the Chancellor of <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s
            suggestion that there be four-power talks on Berlin. Gromyko, he said, also tried to
            have bilateral talks with us on Berlin and our position there. The Secretary said he
            gathered <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> in Paris took up the German and
            Berlin questions, hinting that the Soviets were growing impatient. The Secretary added
            that we had intelligence reports concerning very large military maneuvers in Eastern
            Germany, suggesting that we might find ourselves again with very great pressure over
            Berlin. It was thus important for <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> to try to talk
            out in some detail the wide range of questions affecting our relations with Eastern
            Europe. He deplored the absence of a strong Western policy on this subject and the
            tendency to create confusion.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said, in summary, we have noted a steady relaxation of tensions in
            Eastern Europe which made for better East-West relations. He said our role in increasing
            this better relationship would be somewhat restricted. He believed this subject should
            be discussed further in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. The Secretary asked Mr.
            Ball to comment further on this subject.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary referred to the difficulties which the Federal Republic had
            encountered when it sought to take the lead with Belgium in restricting credits to
            Eastern Europe to the Berne Union rules. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>
            said we made our support of this position clear and tried to persuade our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> partners to agree. The UK, however, would not make any
            distinction between credits to Eastern European countries and to others. As a result, a
            split developed within <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> followed by the French and the Italians going beyond the
            Berne rules. The result was that we had no common policy, which was a matter of great
            regret to us. Our suggestion to have the Berne Union rules accepted as a standard was
            taken up in the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss>. The British showed little
            sympathy for this suggestion. Subsequently, Mr. Leddy undertook to push this further,
            but I am not very sanguine as to what might be accomplished.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName> said the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would go along with general rules applicable to all, but was afraid they
            would want to grant credits for as much as ten years. We feel it was appropriate to
            limit them to five years.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> added that as long as we have members
            of the Alliance who believe in no discrimination, it would be very difficult to develop
            a common policy.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he wished to add that it was important to draw distinctions between
            the smaller countries of Eastern Europe on the basis of the role they played in
            Communist conspiracies in other parts of the world. For instance, Rumania was quite
            inactive, whereas the Czechs were very troublesome.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor said he would like to speak about the Soviet Zone of Occupation of
            Germany. He said we heard more and more about <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> trade
            with the Zone. In this connection, he wished to make it clear that <pb n="288" xml:id="pg_288" facs="0318"/>interzonal trade was not a matter of choice for the
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, was not engaged in for economic reasons. The
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> undertook originally to help Germans in the Zone
            when the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> was literally the only source for aid. Now,
            he said, the situation had changed and the Zone can buy more from other countries which
            has altered zonal trade a considerable degree. If the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> gets long term credits, it will in turn be able to offer credits to
            countries like the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> (350 million marks) to Indonesia
            and Tanzania. By enhancing the economic status of the Zone, the West will in turn permit
            the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> to enhance its political status with countries
            like those above by assisting them economically.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor added he agreed with the Secretary in making a clear distinction between
            the Zone and the Communist Eastern European states. Referring back to trade with the
            Communist Bloc, <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> said that even viewed
            from a businessman's point of view, it was a bad bargain. He urged that we look at trade
            with the Bloc from an economic point of view. He saw disaster ahead if developments in
            the trade field in this area were not kept under control. He noted there was already
            competition in Western European countries to grant credits to Eastern Europe, a
            ridiculous situation.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he did believe trade with the Zone represented a special case. He
            thought that this affected us very little since the volume of trade between us and the
            Zone was so small and so much less than that of Western European countries with the
            Zone.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked the Chancellor how he saw the so-called co-production schemes like
            those of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BB3">Beitz</persName> in Poland. Would they involve
            long term credits?</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor thought the possibilities of anything coming of these schemes were
            rather limited. He envisioned no great opportunities for Krupp. He again suggested that
            it would be up to the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> to achieve better
            coordination in the general field of trade with Eastern Europe. He suggested that these
            countries could offer mainly agricultural products only. The EEC was not in a position
            to expand its imports of agricultural products to any substantial extent. How were they
            going to repay the credits?</p>
                    <p>The Secretary assured the Chancellor that we had no intention of relaxing our
            limitations on credits to the Communist Bloc. The Chancellor warned that German industry
            would try to emulate the actions of other countries. He pointed to <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> trade with the Eastern Bloc as representing only four per
            cent of the total German volume. Before Hitler, German trade with the same area was
            twenty per cent of the total volume.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName> if there were any
            possibility of getting neutral countries like Switzerland and Sweden to agree on credit
            terms if there was no unanimity in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                    <pb n="289" xml:id="pg_289" facs="0319"/>
                    <p>The Chancellor interposed the suggestion he was skeptical that neutrals like
            Switzerland and Sweden, who were so sensitive lest they be accused of being drawn into
            Alliances, would be influenced by <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> decisions. He
            thought the most useful forum was the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> where the
            situation could be discussed in sober commercial terms without openly mentioning the
            political angles.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName> expressed complete agreement with the
            Chancellor. He said that our efforts to achieve an agreed policy in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> had made no progress. To get the neutrals in, you would
            have to proceed on a commercial basis. He agreed fully it was wise to pursue this in the
              <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> and to see how far we could get.</p>

                    <p>The Chancellor stated that as for <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>'s
            solution of the German problem in strictly European terms, this is entirely unacceptable
            to the Germans. The Chancellor wanted to emphasize that point.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor said he had no objections to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s going to Paris. What was sought after there was a certain
            tactical effect.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor stated that German reunification must be achieved by peaceful means. It
            was not possible for the Germans, however, to make advance concessions which would be
            cashed in by the other side without granting anything in return. He said the Germans
            would be ready to discuss substantive matters when serious discussions were in order,
            but there could be no advance concessions.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said we pay no attention to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName>'s suggestion to solve the German problem in the European context. He
            said that we were <pb n="290" xml:id="pg_290" facs="0320"/>not children, that we had
            important rights derived from our victory over the Nazis which we would not surrender to
            either the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> or the French.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor assured him that he never doubted this, but was glad to hear it from us
            from time to time nonetheless.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked if he expected in his upcoming talks with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> to get more specific information about the
            prospects for <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.<note n="2" xml:id="d116fn2">The

                    </p>
                    <p>The Chancellor replied that he was somewhat confident that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> would not reveal a great deal. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName> may realize that he has gone too far. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> had not kept
            his promises to him on the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, moreover he knows that
            his pawns in the Federal Republic, the Gaullists, have grown more skeptical. He said
              <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> knows he is running the danger of
            losing the Germans. At the same time we were all in agreement that we should try to keep
            de Gaulle in the Alliance. As for the French elections, the Chancellor thought even
              <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> cannot afford to show consistent
            stubbornness, disclose new and violent differences and still keep the French people
            behind him. The Chancellor said he was not ready to make concessions to de Gaulle and
            assured the Secretary that he intended to represent German interests. This involved
            standing by those who helped the Germans.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he had had interesting talks with Foreign Minister Schroeder about
            the timing of de Gaulle's moves against <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. The
            Secretary said this was a vital matter. He cited as an illustration of the importance of
            this question the fact that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> had asked
            his people not to discuss with us the question of a new headquarters building for <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">SHAPE</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> suggested jokingly that we ask him after
            September 19, but said we can't face this issue now before the German elections. He said
            that the Federal Republic was the most loyal ally in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. He referred to a German poll which indicated that the German people had
            twenty-four times as much confidence in the US as in France.</p>

                    <p>The President concluded the discussion with the following summary:</p>
                    <p>1. He understood <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s problems with
            General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>. He believed <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> was handling them right. They would continue to
            work together on this problem, and he would support the Chancellor as much as he
            could.</p>
                    <p>2. The <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Alliance must be preserved. The American
            commitments were extremely solid and he would stand by them. <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> would continue with or without France.</p>
                    <p>3. The Chancellor should bring forward any ideas, suggestions and possible approaches
            on the question of reunification of Germany. The President assured the Chancellor these
            ideas would be warmly received and studied with care.</p>
                    <p>4. The President and the Chancellor should keep in touch on the Great Society and the
            Formed Society. They should continue their work in that direction.</p>
                    <p>5. The President appreciated the interest of the Chancellor in development programs for
            Asia. This subject should also be brought up at the United Nations.</p>
                    <p>6. The President assured the Chancellor he would do the best he could to solve the
            conflicts in Viet-Nam and in the Dominican Republic. He appreciated the Chancellor's
            sympathetic attitude toward these problems. The Chancellor could be assured that, if it
            came to defending Berlin, the US would also do the best it could and stand firmly by its
            commitment.</p>
                    <pb n="292" xml:id="pg_292" facs="0322"/>
                    <p>7. The President apologized for being unable to give the Chancellor more time for talks
            during this visit. This was partly due to the cancellation of the Shastri visit. The
            President hoped they would be able to continue their conversation at another date.</p>

            had been a great success and that it refuted <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de

            British <pb n="293" xml:id="pg_293" facs="0323"/>elections. He had been concerned before
            the elections, but was happy with the situation now.</p>
                    <p>Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> commented that one problem
            with the French was that you never knew how long they would keep their promises.
              <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> had agreed to the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, and one-half year later he almost broke the
            Franco-German Friendship Treaty. In Rambouillet he had promised him the chiefs of state
            would have a meeting on European political union, and four months later he declared the
            issue dead and said a meeting was impossible. No basic feeling of trust was possible
            with such a partner. De Gaulle's idea of Europe was French hegemony. He knew he could
            not bring this about alone, but needed Germany's support. Germany did not want that, nor
            did it even want Franco-German hegemony. He believed that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName> felt he was running out of time and that he had to press the issue
            now. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> believed that if he could not
            bring about French hegemony, no one after him would ever be able to accomplish it.</p>

            pressures on the West in Berlin has mounted in recent weeks. The current East German

                    <p>These developments raise a number of broader questions—in addition to the practical
            problem of how best to counter this or that Eastern move. Are the current pressures the
            prelude to a new Berlin crisis of major proportions? If so, what is the likely form and
            scope of the new crisis? If not, what are the probable limits of the pressures? What is
            the Sov/<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> motivation?</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Berlin Senat views:</p>
                    <p>Berlin Senat circles have for some time been advancing a two-fold explanation of what
            they see basically as a new hard phase of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>—as
            distinct from Soviet—policy. First, it is said that hard-line elements within the <gloss target="#t_SED1">SED</gloss> have been winning out over more moderate elements who are
            prepared to seek accommodation with the West. Second, the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> is said to have acquired a certain independence of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> since the fall of <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>, including a certain freedom to mount pressures on the West on
            its own initiative.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Strength and limitations of Senat views:</p>
                    <p>Senat representatives have contacts of various kinds with the East German
            authorities—at the Korber level, through unofficial intermediaries such as the East
            Berlin lawyer Vogel, and through newsmen and other informal channels. They presumably
            obtain certain insights into the internal workings of the East German regime. Two
            reservations seem in order, however. First, the East Germans—and the Soviets—have an
            interest in trying to draw the Senat further into contacts and negotiation. On this
            view, it would make good sense for the East to give the Senat the impression that there
            are people on the Eastern side who are prepared to do business reasonably, that these
            people are involved in an internal struggle with hard-liners, and that the West should
            take this factor into consideration and in turn be prepared to be reasonable in order to
            make things easier for the moderates on the other side. This is an old approach. Second,
            Brandt has an equally obvious interest in trying to make the point in the West about the
            hard-soft struggle on the Eastern side. His policy of small steps and the larger vistas
            it holds out make much better political sense against a background of factional dispute
            within the <gloss target="#t_SED1">SED</gloss> than on the assumption that the East
            German leadership is united. Moreover, in the West German election context Brandt
            presumably fears that an actual sharpening of the Berlin situation would work in favor
            of the party in power. He has already shown sensitivity on this score.<note n="4" xml:id="d119fn4"> Brandt's concerns were reported in telegram 1698 from Berlin, June
              9. (Department of State, Central Files, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 28 <gloss target="#t_GER1">GER</gloss> B)</note>
                    </p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Situation within <gloss target="#t_SED1">SED</gloss>:</p>
                    <p>So far as facts observed by the Mission go, there is little to support the Senat view.
            We have often asked Senat representatives to identify the <pb n="295" xml:id="pg_295" facs="0325"/>supposed <gloss target="#t_SED1">SED</gloss> factions, but without
            result. The reason could be caution on the Senat's part about divulging sensitive
            material. It could on the other hand point to a lack of precise information. Without
            dismissing the first factor, we are inclined to give more weight to the second. East
            Berlin lawyer Vogel has also often talked to Mission representatives about hards and
            softs on the Eastern side, but he has been evasive and vague when pressed for details.
            The Mission is far from dismissing the possibility of factional dispute within the
              <gloss target="#t_SED1">SED</gloss>. In the post-<persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> period there may be important developments as the new generation
            jostles for position. We believe, however, that so long as <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> continues in command, the chances are slight that differences
            will become an important practical factor in East German relations with the West.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Soviet-<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> relationship:</p>
                    <p>In the question of the relationship between the <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> regime and Moscow, the Mission has previously expressed its
            belief that Ulbricht doubtless feels more comfortable now than he did before <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>'s removal. The new Soviet leadership turned
            away sharply from <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>'s somewhat
            experimental approach to the Federal Republic. Soviet efforts to muffle the Sino-Soviet
            dispute in the wake of <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>'s removal must
            also have been a relief to <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>, and he has
            used the opportunity to improve his own relations with Peiping. In purely personal
            terms, <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>—now an elder statesman of the
            Communist world—probably feels on more equal terms with the Brezhnev-<persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> team than he did with <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>. He must also realize his value to the post-<persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> leadership, confronted as it is with difficult
            internal and external problems it has—one with demonstrated ability to keep things
            together in East Germany in times of stress. <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>'s foreign policy successes, notably his visit to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and Tito's recent visit to the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, and the modest recovery of the East German economy, have no doubt also
            given the East German leader added confidence which would be reflected in his relations
            with Moscow and in his public posture towards the West.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, it is a large step from these considerations to the proposition that the
            East German regime has a new-found freedom to run harassments on Berlin which would
            affect the Allies directly, and thus bring broader questions of Soviet-Western relations
            into play. Such a development would be contrary to what we have assumed—and what long
            experience has shown—is a basic Soviet interest, namely to keep Berlin matters affecting
            relations with the Western Powers firmly in their own hands. It is difficult to imagine
            that this interest is now in process of changing. In a period of apparent overall
            caution in Soviet policy toward the West, it would seem that the need for control of the
            Berlin situation would be more than ever necessary for Moscow. It will be recalled in
            this connection that the Polish defector Tykocinski was categorical on the <pb n="296" xml:id="pg_296" facs="0326"/>point of Soviet control of any moves in Berlin which
            might affect their relations with the West.</p>
                    <p>Positive factors in current Soviet-<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> attitude:</p>
                    <p>In short, we believe the Senat's views are not in themselves altogether satisfactory in
            explaining the current situation. It is also relevant to note that the pressures on the
            West from the Soviets and the East Germans have been accompanied by some factors which
            point in the other direction. (1) The Soviets have moved with reasonable speed to repair
            the damage to the <gloss target="#t_USMLM1">USMLM</gloss> house. (2) The East Germans
            finally released the two West Berliners arrested at Easter, even though the East German
            who duped them and escaped to West Berlin with their identity papers was not extradited.
            (3) The East Germans have designated an official to conduct future pass negotiations.
            (4) The Reichsbahn position on rail tariffs seems not to be as hard as it was once
            thought to be. (5) US official civilian entry to East Berlin has been resumed without
            difficulty. (6) Ambassador Seydoux seems to have found Abrasimov in a fairly relaxed and
            uncombative frame of mind last week. (7) The <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> is
            apparently continuing to [garble] to the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> through
            private lawyer channels. (8) There are no indications that the East Germans intend to
            stop or curtail pensioner visits. (9) The Allied and German civilian access situation is
            normal. (10) The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> have made progress toward settlement of various <gloss target="#t_IZT1">IZT</gloss> problems.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Conclusions:</p>
                    <p>The Mission is inclined to see the following as the main factors in the Soviet-<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> position.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. West German elections:</p>
                    <p>The elections have introduced a kind of pause in Soviet-<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> relations with Bonn and the Berlin Senat, in the sense that there is
            probably little point in taking positive initiatives until the new German government is
            formed. At the same time, policy tends not to stand still, and there is perhaps a
            disposition to believe that with the West German Government and Mayor Brandt
            increasingly swept up in the election campaign, the next few months can be used with
            greater impunity for increasing pressures. US absorption with Southeast Asia and
            Caribbean affairs is presumably also a factor on the Eastern side.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. East German pressures on the Soviets:</p>
                    <p>The East Germans may be pressing the Soviets to let them try to increase their presence
            in Berlin, and it is Soviet policy also to enlarge the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> role—with the proviso, we believe, that the situation brought about by
            any initiatives be relatively safe and capable of being brought under complete Soviet
            control should need arise. We could imagine the East Germans arguing with the Soviets
            that the attack on the <gloss target="#t_USMLM1">USMLM</gloss> house and the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> helicopter flights over East Berlin and around the West
            Berlin sector-zonal borders would be safe yet politically useful. They could <pb n="297" xml:id="pg_297" facs="0327"/>point to our past record of caution in retaliating
            against the Soviet Liaison Mission and guess that we attach enough importance to the
              <gloss target="#t_USMLM1">USMLM</gloss> that we would be prepared to swallow the
            Potsdam incident. As for the helicopter flights, the East Germans probably argued that
            these could be carried out with little risk. Perhaps the Soviets gave conditional
            approval to the flights, reserving the right to enter the picture if the Western
            reaction were such in their view as to warrant their intervention.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">C. Vietnam:</p>
                    <p>The Soviet predicament with the Vietnam situation may have inclined Moscow to accede
            more readily to East German pressures for initiatives on Berlin. On this view, which has
            been most explicitly stated in Berlin by Boelke, the editor of Tagesspiegel, the current
            pressures on Berlin represent a kind of substitute crisis laid on in part to
            counterbalance US policy in Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>Theoretically at least, the Soviets enjoy a very wide range of options on Berlin as a
            “substitute crisis.” They could go all the way to resumption of the direct <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> challenge to Allied access. They know pretty
            well what difficulties this would bring on in the West. On the other hand, they also
            know from the <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> period that it is
            difficult for them to go beyond a certain point in challenging the West without bringing
            on the risk of direct confrontation with all the uncertainties this involves. In this
            reading, pressures on the West on Berlin at the present juncture must seem attractive to
            the Soviets, yet they must also be aware of the political limitations.</p>
                    <p>It is difficult from Berlin to judge the present Soviet mood. We have the impression
            from recent Soviet and <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> statements stressing the need
            to observe the status quo in Berlin that the current Eastern attitude is not a radically
            forward one. Admittedly, the statements called on the West to observe the status quo
            without committing the East, but it seems worth noting in this connection that Tito
            during his recent East Berlin visit<note n="5" xml:id="d119fn5">June 8–13.</note> seemed
            to be calling on both East and West to do nothing that would increase tensions in
            Germany.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Prospects:</p>
                    <p>In summary, I would conclude that we are in for a period of increased probing in Berlin
            subject to careful Soviet control, in which—as always—the Western reaction at any stage
            will be an important factor for the Soviets in weighing further moves; that the Soviets
            will continue to be flexible and keep [garble] maneuver towards the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and the West in following any course of action; and that
            the evidence so far does not point to a Soviet-<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
            intention of bringing on a crisis of major dimensions. A failure—which would be publicly
            apparent—on our part to <pb n="298" xml:id="pg_298" facs="0328"/>react with firmness to
            probes, such as the helicopter flights, against established Allied rights could
            seriously mislead the Eastern leadership as well as the West Berlin leadership and
            populace. The East is apparently prepared to accept a measure of risk—not so far a very
            large measure—in carrying out the helicopter flights. It is difficult to see how the
            West can influence Eastern views without itself accepting some measure of risk.</p>

            I had a useful discussion yesterday with Dean Acheson and Jack McCloy on the helicopter
            problem in Berlin.<note n="2" xml:id="d120fn2">As part of the campaign of harassment
              undertaken by East German authorities at the time of the April Bundestag meeting in
              Berlin, East German helicopters began to enter the Berlin control zone and air
              corridors between West Berlin and the Federal Republic of Germany with increasing
              frequency. For text of the April 8 U.S. protest note, see Documents on Germany,
              1944–1985, pp. 893–894. In a June 23 memorandum to the Secretary of Defense, the Joint
              Chiefs of Staff recommended “concerted political action by the Western allies” to
              force the Soviet and East German authorities to cease this harassment. (Johnson
              Library, National Security File, Country File, Germany, vol. 8)</note> There was no
            disagreement with the steps we are already taking, such as official representations in
            Moscow and/or the three capitals. It was also agreed that we should press the Germans to
            suspend negotiations between Airflot and Lufthansa relating this to the helicopter
            problem.</p>
                    <p>The main issue discussed was whether or not we should ourselves resume helicopter
            flights over East Berlin. The military are in general opposed to doing this at this time
            as they fear that linking these with the East German flights might end in our losing our
            right to fly over East Berlin. We probably have little chance of stopping the East
            German flights over East Berlin unless we take some very strong action, such as
            paralleling their flights along the sector border with flights of our own inside <pb n="299" xml:id="pg_299" facs="0329"/>East Berlin. It is not certain that this would
            lead to cessation of their flights but if it did, we would probably end up by having to
            give up our own flights.</p>
                    <p>The general judgment of Acheson and McCloy was that we should maintain the legal
            position that all East German flights are a violation of quadripartite rules but that in
            fact we only act to prevent the East Germans flying over East Berlin. They would go
            quite far in this connection even to the point of using force to bring down an East
            German helicopter over West Berlin.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary suggested we should investigate the “dirty tricks” department to see if
            we could not make the East Germans look ridiculous. The most hopeful idea which we are
            investigating is to encourage West Berlin youths to fly kites along the sector borders
            to harass the East German flights.</p>

                    <p>4986. Subj: <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s views on Berlin.
            Following is the discussion on the question of Berlin, during my meeting yesterday with
            Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>. Other subjects discussed are
            being reported separately.<note n="2" xml:id="d121fn2">In telegram 4973 from Bonn, June
              23. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_GER1">GER</gloss> W–US)</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>I recounted to the Chancellor the recent series of adverse events in Berlin: The damage
            to our Potsdam Mission; the shooting at the Teltow Canal on June 15; the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> denunciation of the barge and rail agreements, and the
            flight of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> helicopters initiated on June 5. I asked
            the Chancellor for his own appraisal of whether this represented a general stiffening of
            the Soviet-<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> posture in Berlin.</p>
                    <pb n="300" xml:id="pg_300" facs="0330"/>
                    <p>The Chancellor replied that he construed these events to represent a well-planned,
            large-scale attempt to build up the pretense of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
            sovereignty. It was hoped thereby to show the world that there are two German states. If
            the Soviets and the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> are able to make good their
            present threats, damages would accrue which represent a greater price than the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> can pay. The whole future of interzonal trade is at
            stake.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor deplored, along familiar lines, the granting of credits by the Western
            states to the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. (He admitted that the US is not
            involved, as I pointed out.) As one of the results, iron and steel, which had formerly
            played an important part in <gloss target="#t_IZT1">IZT</gloss> trade, were now largely
            furnished to the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> by others. The Western credits may
            have played a role in encouraging the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> to seek
            further to diminish the right of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> to represent
            all Germans. The pass discussions held between Korber and Kohl on June 21 had ended in a
            few minutes. Twenty percent of the passes issued to West Berliners during the Whitsun
            vacations had not been used; he interpreted this to mean that the people were afraid to
            use them.</p>
                    <p>With respect to barge traffic, the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> aim is to
            replace permanent barge permits by permits which must be granted for each trip. The
              <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> threat to terminate rail traffic is a “devilish”
            thing. The East Germans say that future arrangements must be made as between
            states—i.e., at the Cabinet level. If there is no new agreement they may disrupt
            traffic. In either case the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> would be able to prove
            its two-state theory. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> must either negotiate at
            the Cabinet level, or face proof that the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> has the
            right to stop shipments at the border.</p>
                    <p>Free access to Berlin, continued the Chancellor, is based on Allied agreements and the
              <gloss target="#t_IZT1">IZT</gloss>. The possibility exists that <gloss target="#t_IZT1">IZT</gloss> can be interrupted in retaliation against a denial of
            access; however, this could only be done if the Allies would guarantee that the
            necessary goods for Berlin would be provided. He referred to his recent discussion with
            French Amb Seydoux on this point, in which the latter had raised the question of the
            possible re-mounting of an airlift in such circumstances. The Chancellor asked whether
            this would be possible. He emphasized that the <gloss target="#t_IZT1">IZT</gloss> does
            not exist for purely commercial reasons—only as a means of assuring access.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> The Chancellor took a more serious view of the barge and
            rail problems than the <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> projected last week.
            Generally speaking, I think that his assessment is overly gloomy, in that he almost
            seems to assume that some stoppage of rail and waterway access is likely, unless, as he
            says, the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> agrees to “Cabinet level”
            negotiations.</p>
                    <p>Our judgment to date, in which both the French and British Embassies as well as the
              <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> concur, is that the Zone, with its
            implication of a July 1 deadline, is probably demonstrating its standard pre-negotiating
            tactic of trying to maximize pressure on the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. As we
            have reported <pb n="301" xml:id="pg_301" facs="0331"/>(Embtel 4916),<note n="3" xml:id="d121fn3">Not found.</note> the East Germans have in fact backed down from
            earlier extreme demands that international (CIM) rail rates be introduced on July 1.</p>
                    <p>The barge situation is less clear, but I also do not presently expect a “blockade.” The
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> will
            probably settle down to a prolonged, and perhaps not overly comfortable dickering over
            barge permits—of a type familiar to us in past talks on the Hof Bridge and a fourteenth
            train path.</p>
                    <p>What I think the Chancellor's views reflect, is that the weekend developments have
            upset a cautious German optimism of last week. Over the weekend the Zone has sharpened
            its air demands, posed brusque demands in the pass talks, and begun a new line of attack
            against <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> “war plans.” While this <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> activity has proved upsetting to the Germans, I think
            that it is mostly declamatory in purpose, rather than the signal for a serious test of
            strength on Berlin.</p>

                    <p>5015. Subject: Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s views on
            Berlin. Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> called in the French
            Ambassador and British and U.S. Charges on June 24 to impress on the three Occupation
            Powers the seriousness with which his govt regards the developing situation in Berlin.
            Surrounded by Vice Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_ME4">Mende</persName>, Minister
              <persName corresp="#p_WL5">Westrick</persName>, State Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> and Hrautwig, and other German officials, he made
            a lengthy opening presentation lasting some thirty minutes along the following
            lines:</p>
                    <p>1. The situation in Berlin, which was causing great concern to the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, should not be played down. It was the result of a
            conscious and <pb n="302" xml:id="pg_302" facs="0332"/>concerted policy clearly aimed at
            the enhancement of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> status and intended also to cause
            trouble in the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> before elections by raising the level
            of insecurity and fear. <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> threats and actions were
            obviously supported if not stimulated by Moscow. Ever since the Bundestag session in
            April (about which he did not wish to speak at this time), a developing pattern of
            harassments had emerged.</p>
                    <p>2. After enumerating the various <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> actions which fell
            within this pattern, he stressed that the helicopter flights over West Berlin were the
            most serious and dramatic. (He actually said “Soviet helicopter flights” but Westrick
            corrected him by noting that the flights in question were East German.)</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> had spoken to Bundestag Fraktion leaders
            earlier in the day and all had agreed that something must be done. The helicopters over
            West Berlin had to be forced to land, and the German Govt would welcome it if—without
            launching an air war of course—this could be achieved. The East Germans were probing to
            see how far they could go and they had to be resisted.</p>
                    <p>3. As to the Interzonal Trade agreement, the German Govt would give it up tomorrow if
            it were not for the connection between the <gloss target="#t_IZT1">IZT</gloss> and free
            access to Berlin. If such a step were to be taken, the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> would have to consider, in consultation with its Allies, the effects on
            Berlin and what must as a consequence be done.</p>
                    <p>4. It was necessary to make a basic distinction between trade with the Eastern European
            countries and trade with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. The former were at
            least partly independent national entities. As <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> had previously suggested to President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>, it
            was desirable that the subject of trade with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> be
            discussed in the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss>. The German Govt had noted that
            the <gloss target="#t_IZT1">IZT</gloss> was becoming progressively less interesting to
            the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, since it was getting increasing deliveries from
            other countries as well as long-term credits. Since the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>'s allies supported her opposition to the two-German-state theory, it was
            inconsistent and wrong to undermine this opposition by giving trade and credit
            assistance to the Soviet Zone.</p>
                    <p>5. After repeating that his views had the support of all party leaders in the
            Bundestag, <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> again stressed the importance
            of action against <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> helicopter flights in order to
            maintain West Berlin morale. Mere protests would not suffice; the helicopter flights had
            to be stopped.</p>
                    <p>6. It was also essential to prevent any upgrading of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. If the <gloss target="#t_IZT1">IZT</gloss> were to be involved as a
            countermeasure and access to Berlin were interrupted as a result, the Western Powers
            would have to proceed on the assumption that an airlift of the 1948–49 variety would no
            longer suffice to keep Berlin supplied with its basic requirements.</p>
                    <p>7. The German Govt had lived through August 13, 1961, when the initial erection of the
            Wall took place, without sufficiently serious reactions. <pb n="303" xml:id="pg_303" facs="0333"/>The Allies likewise had limited themselves to protests. The experience of
            1961 could simply not be repeated.</p>
                    <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> requested that the Allied
            representatives present report the German position back to their governments, and hoped
            that official responses would soon be available so that a further exchange of views
            could take place and agreement on action could be reached.</p>
                    <p>French Ambassador Seydoux responded that he could assure Erhard the three Occupying
            Powers were concerned about the Berlin situation and efforts to enhance the status of
            the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. The three Embassies in Bonn were consulting on
            a daily basis with German Foreign Office representatives as well as keeping in close
            touch with all pertinent developments. The Wall had been a brutal and decisive act,
            Seydoux observed, which was different in kind from the isolated actions under discussion
            today. It was too soon to know the precise scope and significance of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> threats and harassments. The French Embassy still saw the
            possibility that <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> was acting largely on
            his own initiative although obviously with general Soviet permission, and it was not
            clear how far the Soviets would permit him to go.</p>
                    <p>It was necessary to distinguish, Seydoux continued, between the helicopter problem,
            which clearly fell within the responsibility of the three Occupying Powers for the
            security of West Berlin, and the various other issues raised by the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, which were initially matters of German concern. The
            three governments were presently considering the helicopter problem and following the
            Berlin situation closely. It was obviously desirable and necessary that a common policy
            be worked out on problems of mutual concern.</p>
                    <p>In response to Seydoux's query, <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>
            repeated that the German Government would like Allied support when the Germans raised
            the problem of Western trade with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and the
            extensions of credits in the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss>. When <persName corresp="#p_WL5">Westrick</persName> pointed out that no <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> meeting was scheduled in the near future, <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> said he would then ask for a special session. He believed it better
            to use the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> for this purpose rather than <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, since discussion in the latter forum would seem to
            give the subject an aggressive character. If there were a united Western front against
            the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> in this field, <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> continued, <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> would
            soon retreat in order to avoid losing prestige. The German Government wanted to disabuse
            other countries of the idea that the <gloss target="#t_IZT1">IZT</gloss> was simply a
            matter of business for the Germans which as such they were reluctant to sacrifice. But
            assurances first were necessary that the whole exercise of cancelling the <gloss target="#t_IZT1">IZT</gloss> would not be futile because other Western countries would
            move into the gap with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The U.S. and British Charges concurred generally in Seydoux's remarks, pointing out
            that the evidence was still not conclusive that a major Berlin crisis was in the offing
            but that the Four Powers had to be <pb n="304" xml:id="pg_304" facs="0334"/>vigilant and
            united in meeting any difficulties that might arise. U.S. Charge noted that, while the
            West was being confronted with new challenges, at the same time we were winning some
            victories, for example, the East German backdown after a nine-month refusal to
            acknowledge in writing that the basis of civil rail access to Berlin was Allied instead
            of purely intra-German; abandonment by the Reichsbahn on June 15 of the demand that
            international rail rates be introduced as of July 1; <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
            concession on the Hof Bridge reconstruction project; and <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> return this month of one of two West German aircraft downed in East
            Germany without <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> compliance with the original demand
            for negotiations at the plenipotentiary level. In all these instances, Western
            perseverance and firmness had won out. Hence it was hard to claim that a clear pattern
            of obdurate <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> harassment had emerged in June.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> concluded by emphasizing again the
            necessity for some Allied action beyond mere protests against <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> helicopters over West Berlin. Otherwise West Berlin morale would suffer
            seriously. <persName corresp="#p_ME4">Mende</persName> chimed in to say that he had just
            heard from former Berlin Mayor Friedensburg. The latter had confirmed that it was
            psychologically of greatest importance to West Berlin that the Occupying Powers do
            something about the helicopter flights. Otherwise the effect would be much worse than
            over the Allied failure to react sufficiently against the harassments attendant upon the
            April Bundestag meeting in Berlin. Finally, <persName corresp="#p_WL5">Westrick</persName> added that Senator Schutz of Berlin had telephoned him just
            before this meeting to stress the need for action against helicopter infringements.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> It seems clear that the Germans have already worked
            themselves up very much over the Berlin situation, with special emphasis on the Allied
            failure so far to do anything effective against East German helicopter flights over West
            Berlin. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> and the other officials present
            were in a somber mood, and their concern was obviously genuine, though the Chancellor
            was occasionally a bit shaky on his facts. He seemed particularly sensitive about
            criticisms which seemed to have reached him as to German reluctance to use the <gloss target="#t_IZT1">IZT</gloss> weapon against the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>1. We have reviewed this problem further and are now seeking Allied and German
            agreement to the following guidelines:</p>
                    <p>(1) By a series of graduated steps to bring about cessation of East German helicopter
            flights over West Berlin.</p>
                    <p>(2) So long as East German helicopters do not overfly West Berlin and do not constitute
            safety hazard to Allied air access to Berlin, we will not take direct action to prevent
            such flights.</p>
                    <p>(3) We shall continue to protest in all cases East German helicopter flights as
            violations of quadripartite agreements, and to seek practical means short of use of
            force to discourage them.</p>
                    <p>(4) We retain right to fly US helicopters over East Berlin when we so desire.</p>
                    <p>(5) We do not believe US helicopter flights should be equated with East German
            helicopter flights.</p>
                    <p>2. We distinguish flights over West Berlin from those over East Berlin on the same
            practical ground that has governed our Berlin policy for many years: namely, that we
            have power in West Berlin but none in East Berlin. We lodge regular protests over what
            the Soviets and the East Germans do in East Berlin when it violates quadripartite
            agreements, but we do not use force on the far side of the wall.</p>
                    <p>3. We are asking our people in Bonn and Berlin, and Lemnitzer's people, for
            recommendations on the ways and means of stopping any further helicopter flights over
            West Berlin. We will then try to get British and French agreement on these specific
            measures.</p>
                    <p>5. This matter is politically urgent because of the German election and the
            sensitivities of Brandt and <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>. But there
            have not been new violations of West Berlin air space in recent days, so that its
            military urgency is not so high for the moment.</p>

                    <p>19. Subj: The reunification issue after the German elections.</p>
                    <p>Part 1 (of 2)—The case for an initiative.</p>
                    <p>In discussions of the reunification question with non-Germans one encounters: (1) The
            perennial question of whether the West German people really want reunification very
            strongly; (2) A current variation, whether the present professed interest of the German
            politicians is not mainly for electoral purposes; and (3) Independently of what the
            Germans think, whether an effort to reactivate negotiations with the Soviets is
            worthwhile so long as the latter clearly have no interest in changing the present
            situation.</p>
                    <p>My own judgment is that, after the question of their own security—which Germans
            naturally regard as their most vital interest—they have no political objective or
            interest more important to them than the achievement of national unity. Recent polls
            indicate that reunification remains the leading national preoccupation, particularly
            among the youth. Once it is introduced, any politician will subordinate every other
            question to the discussion of this theme.</p>
                    <p>It is not, moreover, merely a preoccupation of the politicians. One German out of five
            came from the East when the Federal Republic was established. There has been a movement
            of 3.7 million refugees from the Soviet Zone since 1950. Close to 40 percent of all West
            Germans have close relatives in the Zone. Particularly in light of the continuing
            vulnerability of West Berlin, the division of the country affects too many persons for
            the problem to subside. The prosperity of West Germans in comparison with their Eastern
            brothers weighs heavily on their conscience. The less decisive Soviet leadership
            combined with the increasing freedom of maneuver of the Eastern European states gives
            rise to more hope than during the regimes of Stalin and <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>. In short, I do not think we can, after the German elections,
            avoid facing the reunification issue anew.</p>
                    <p>This is, I believe, true despite the fact that, in point of time, the Germans
            unquestionably regard the third basic tenet of their foreign policy, Western European
            integration, as realizable sooner. It is true that there is no great popular clamor
            about reunification—or signs of unrest. There is, however, a large and active lobby, the
            “indivisible Germany” organization <pb n="307" xml:id="pg_307" facs="0337"/>—fortunately
            not extremist—which is supported across the board by all three parties, the government,
            and private concerns such as the Springer publications. Reunification is also the
            principal theme of the refugee organizations and their annual rallies.</p>
                    <p>I would, however, judge the attitude of the average German individual to be the
            realistic one that this is a problem for their government to do something about and
            that, in the last resort, progress will depend upon the four original Occupying Powers
            more than Bonn. Moreover, he recognizes that, given the present Soviet attitude, the
            reunification problem will take a long time to resolve. Finally, he would expect that
            Germany will still have to pay a heavy price for reunification.</p>
                    <p>All this, however, does not affect the average person's critical question: What is
            being done about reunification? The answer to this, for the average man is—very little,
            certainly not enough. It is widely known that even the government's modest efforts—such
            as <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> Schroeder's proposals at the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meetings in December and May for a Tripartite
            declaration, and the various suggestions submitted to the Ambassadorial Group—were not
            well received by the Allies. There is no public evidence, on the other hand, of new
            Allied proposals or enthusiasm for progress on reunification except for public
            statements of approval in principle—which, although the Germans continue to want, they
            have come to discount. The feeling is widespread that the Allied performance suffers by
            comparison with efforts made at the time of the Berlin and Geneva Conferences.</p>
                    <p>The question is not likely to arise in an acute form during the pre-electoral period.
            So far as the German Government is concerned, I believe that the Tripartite declaration
            of May 12 meets their requirements for the record, at least to remove the pressure for
            an initiative toward the Soviets at this time. However, after the elections, one of the
            first measuring rods that will be applied to the new government—regardless which party
            wins—is what it will try to do about reunification.</p>
                    <p>If the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> wins, they are already committed toward a
            policy of more flexible and active efforts toward the East. If, as is more probable, the
            present <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_FDP1">FDP</gloss>
            coalition remains in office, they must at least try to give new life to the efforts they
            have made in the past to enlist support for a new initiative on the German question.
            If—as cannot be excluded—a grand coalition of <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> should be formed, an agreed plank will almost certainly
            be the enhancement of efforts to achieve reunification. It would, moreover, be the first
            government so broadly based as to be able to pay an additional price if that became
            relevant (e.g. recognition of the Oder-Neisse boundary).</p>
                    <p>To my mind it makes no great difference whether or at what point the Soviets reject a
            Western proposal, assuming, as the Soviet experts predict, that this is likely. If we
            were governed by the Soviet attitude <pb n="308" xml:id="pg_308" facs="0338"/>toward
            outstanding issues across-the-board, we would have to refrain from making any proposal
            known to be unpalatable to them. I do not believe that there is any conclusive evidence
            that the Soviets would “hot up” Berlin just because the Allies made a peaceful
            reunification proposal. It seems more likely that such a move would be made only if it
            would serve some more vital current interest.</p>
                    <p>It seems to me elemental that if someone is “sitting on you,” as Moscow is on East
            Germany, you should be entitled from time to time to ask them to “get off.”
            Fundamentally, all that the Germans demand of us is that we join them in such a request.
            It keeps the record straight that the Communist take-over of East Germany is still
            regarded as an unsettled question by the Western Powers—as well as an affront to
            humanity. It prevents any misinterpretation—this is the point the Germans are interested
            in—that our various efforts towards increased contacts with the East, normalization of
            relations, relaxation of tensions, and all that is popularly described as “détente,”
            signify acquiescence in a status quo confirming the continued Soviet occupation and
            legitimizing the Communist government of the East Zone.</p>
                    <p>I regard our efforts toward increased contacts with the East, normalization of
            relations, etc., as of much importance and perhaps the only practicable course under
            present conditions. I am convinced that most Germans do too, if they can feel reassured
            that we are not resting with regard to reunification. I believe that we should, in order
            to so reassure them, be willing not only to support a revived and revised German
            initiative, but that we should, if necessary, be willing to take the lead with our
            Allies in formulating new proposals, as we did before the Berlin and Geneva Conferences.
            In any event, we must expect the Germans to approach us again about an initiative after
            September. I feel that, in the intervening period, we should prepare ourselves for the
            next German approach and I understand that studies directed toward this end are going
            forward in the Department. Preliminary suggestions with respect to an approach will be
            given in a following telegram.<note n="2" xml:id="d124fn2">Not found.</note>

                    <p>1. Between March 23 and June 21 there was a series of identified East German helicopter
            flights over and/or along the borders of West Berlin. Our guidelines for responding to
            such flights have been and presently are relatively conservative—e.g., protest; attempt
            to chase the intruders away.</p>
                    <pb n="310" xml:id="pg_310" facs="0340"/>
                    <p>2. When Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> meets with you on
              Thursday,<note n="2" xml:id="d126fn2">July 22. According to the President's Daily
              Diary, <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> participated in a short lunch
              with the President and other senior officials that began at 2:11 p.m. (Ibid.) No
              record of this meeting was found.</note> he may indicate his interest in obtaining
            authorization for taking sterner military/diplomatic counter-actions in the event
            another East German helicopter flight occurs over or along the borders of West Berlin.
            He may also indicate his interest in obtaining authorization to resume U.S. helicopter
            flights over East Berlin.</p>
                    <p>3. Both of these problems, which, as you know, are extremely complicated and sensitive,
            are presently being staffed out in detail in the Departments of State and Defense. While
            there is no need at this point to burden you with the details, you should know that
            State and Defense (and especially State) tend to be more conservative and cautious on
            this spectrum of problems than <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName>, who is understandably more sensitive than
            Washington to West German heat, feels that we should be prepared to go to some fairly
            extreme lengths to halt future East German helicopter flights over and along the border
            of West Berlin; in certain circumstances, for example, he would probably be prepared to
            cause East German helicopters to crash.</p>
                    <p>4. If <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> does raise the issue with you, you
            may want to hear him out and tell him (a) that you understand that the Departments are
            now studying his recommendations, (b) that you don't want to prejudge the issue until
            you hear from <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, and (c) that, given Vietnam, you are
            interested, generally speaking, in keeping the Washington/Moscow temperature at a low
            level.</p>

                    <p rend="center">I. Introduction and Purpose</p>
                    <p>For a variety of reasons, the problem of divided Germany has not been at the center of
            diplomatic activity for some time. Critical situations outside of Europe have held major
            attention. The Soviets have been preoccupied by the tensions and uncertainties of a
            change in leadership and by the spreading disarray in the Communist world. The West has
            been distracted by discords of its own over the organization of Europe and the structure
            of the alliance.</p>
                    <p>It may be that problems like these will continue for some time longer to take
            precedence; the new approach to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> which had been
            contemplated for the period after the West German elections in September does not now
            seem likely to be timely. We can be sure, however, that Germany as the most central of
            all the issues between the West and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will
            sooner or later return to the active agenda. This paper appraises, against the
            background of our two decades of experience and the changing scene in Eastern Europe,
            various approaches which have been suggested for Western policy. It states some views
            about the probable long-term development of the German problem, and draws some
            implications for American policy, especially in relations with the Federal Republic.</p>
                    <p>II. Some Suggested Approaches to the German Problem</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. Formal Initiatives for Negotiation</p>
                    <p>The three Western powers will continue from time to time to be under pressure from the
            West Germans to undertake formal diplomatic approaches to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in quest of a return to Four-Power negotiations. This is a natural
            by-product of German internal politics, as well as of a need for reassurance that the
            allies remain actually committed to Germany's reunification.</p>
                    <pb n="312" xml:id="pg_312" facs="0342"/>
                    <p>We know that such “initiatives” will be barren of any result. The Soviets are committed
            to maintain the division of Germany indefinitely if they can. They consider that the
            survival of Communist power in East Germany is inseparable from their hegemony in
            Eastern Europe as a whole; they are unwilling to hazard that power position, the prize
            of victory in World War II, by permitting a reunited Germany to revive the historic
            struggle of Germans and Russians in that area. Any leadership under the present regime
            which allowed a reunited Germany to emerge and, as the Soviets would expect, to
            challenge their dominant influence in Eastern Europe, would suffer the most severe
            ideological and political consequences. Considerations of this kind, more than a concern
            for military security in the specific sense, or even for the great economic value which
            East Germany has for the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, almost certainly
            determine the unyielding nature of the Soviet attitude.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s intention to maintain the status quo in
            Central Europe would probably hold firm whatever guarantees the West might offer against
            wayward conduct by a reunited Germany. The Soviets would agree to the dismantling of
            Communist power in East Germany only if developments there took such a turn that it
            seemed likely to become more costly or dangerous to remain than to withdraw. Short of a
            contingency like revolt or other serious difficulties for the East German regime, the
            Soviets mean to stay.</p>
                    <p>This Soviet attitude is based in the last analysis on a view of Russian national
            interest and might not change even if there should be a considerable dilution of the
            ideological elements which presently condition the Soviet outlook. At the very least, it
            is necessary to posit an end to the cold war and the power alignments associated with it
            in order to make such a change seem plausible at all.</p>
                    <p>Since proposals for negotiations which aim at the removal of Communist control from
            East Germany will not gain a favorable response in the foreseeable future, the only
            relevant question concerning them is what advantages or costs they may have. Clearly
            they do serve the purpose of cementing relations with the West Germans. Beyond this,
            they are of use in reminding the Soviets, and the world, that we continue to regard
            German reunification as essential to a general settlement, should they ever be disposed
            to seek one.</p>
                    <p>There may be circumstances, however, in which relations with the Soviets are unduly
            burdened by proposals for negotiations on Germany. When the main focus of
            Soviet-American dealings is elsewhere, as at present during the Viet Nam crisis, or
            perhaps at some moment when a desirable arms control measure becomes possible of
            agreement, would be such occasions.</p>
                    <p>On the whole, we should probably continue to be sparing of formal approaches to the
            Soviets for negotiations and calculate carefully the <pb n="313" xml:id="pg_313" facs="0343"/>suitable occasions. We should try to satisfy the Germans as much as
            possible with unilateral declarations in lieu of formal initiatives. These might also
            give primary stress to the theme of self-determination as the ground on which a German
            settlement remains a pressing issue, rather than to the theme of the Soviets' legal
            obligations under the Four-Power arrangements. Periodic enunciation of
            self-determination for Germany as the key to security in Central Europe should serve to
            underline our position adequately. Such statements are also more effective as political
            warfare in Germany and Eastern Europe than yet another curt Soviet rejection of a formal
            invitation to negotiate.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. Arms Control and Security Measures</p>
                    <p>This approach proceeds from the view that certain arms control and security agreements
            could reduce the danger of conflict in Central Europe and consequently over time create
            an atmosphere which would favor a general political settlement. Standard proposals of
            this sort include observation and inspection of military dispositions on both sides,
            prohibition of nuclear weapons in an agreed zone, partial troop withdrawals and
            non-aggression pacts.</p>
                    <p>The error in this approach lies in the false assumption from which it proceeds, namely
            that the Soviets insist upon remaining in Germany primarily because they fear for their
            military security. In fact, as argued above, there is more at stake than that. But even
            if the Soviets were primarily concerned with military security, they would almost
            certainly continue to believe that the division of Germany itself was for them essential
            in any combination of security-arms control measures. The Soviet and in particular
            Polish interest in negotiating about undertakings of this kind, therefore, is precisely
            that these would have the effect of consolidating and guaranteeing the status quo. And
            because this is so, they would have the further effect of bringing discord into our
            relations with Bonn, as indeed even negotiations in this field tend to do.</p>
                    <p>These undesirable consequences are not balanced by any meaningful gain for peace and
            security. The risk of conflict in Central Europe is in fact slight; the East-West
            frontier drawn by the 20-year-old military confrontation in the center of Germany is
            probably as stable as any in the world.</p>
                    <p>The one respect in which stability could be improved would be by obtaining firmer
            guarantees for the security of West Berlin and its access routes. The measures referred
            to above have little bearing on this problem, and the Soviets and East Germans have
            shown little interest in providing such guarantees.</p>
                    <p>As a general rule, our policy should be governed by the proposition that limited arms
            control and security measures in Central Europe have little interest for us when they
            are unrelated to political developments <pb n="314" xml:id="pg_314" facs="0344"/>which
            advance a general settlement in Germany. Measures of this kind serve Communist political
            objectives and not our own, and by so doing burden our relations with West Germany to no
            purpose. On the other hand, of course, we cannot do what the Germans sometimes seem to
            want us to do, that is, to make all arms control agreements conditional on progress
            toward their national goal.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">C. Bridges to Eastern Europe</p>
                    <p>Recognition that the division of Germany and of Europe cannot be ended by negotiating
            devices designed to have effect in the short term has focused attention on possible
            efforts to prepare a settlement by furthering a long-term process of fundamental change
            in Eastern Europe. Broadly stated, this view argues that the development of East-West
            economic and cultural relations can gradually erode the ideological commitment of the
            East to maintain the present reach of Communist power into the heart of Germany. In its
            more elaborate forms, this thesis speaks of all-European economic development schemes
            under which Western assistance would become the persuader which would diminish
            ideological tensions and convince the East that the division of Germany was no longer
            essential to its interests.</p>
                    <p>It is evident that the retreat from monolithic ideology and the assertion of national
            independence in Eastern Europe are real. These trends result from a variety of
            factors—the disappearance and the subsequent denigration of the semi-divinity who
            embodied Moscow's authority in the period when Moscow's power was first thrust into
            Eastern Europe, the later recognition by the Communist regimes thus artificially created
            that they needed local sources of authority to be viable, and finally the Yugoslav and
            Chinese challenges to the idea that there should be any central fount of authority for
            the Communist world at all. What is emerging from the former satellite empire in Eastern
            Europe is a system of states whose ruling groups still regard their ideological,
            security, and economic ties to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> as essential,
            but who wish to define the latter's overlordship in terms of maximum advantage to
            themselves.</p>
                    <p>What would Western programs of aid, contact, and even inclusion in Western multilateral
            arrangements offer to such ruling groups? The Communist leaders would, of course,
            welcome easier access to Western markets, and probably also generous aid if this could
            be dressed in business garb and seem to be without ideological implications. These would
            advance economic development and buttress national independence. But any inference that
            such an elaboration of East-West relations should lead on to a broader structure of
            European unity, presumably bringing with it free cultural and political intercourse,
            would be fatal to the present ruling groups. Their survival rests on the preservation of
            Communist theological myths, however changed or attenuated, on national exclusiveness,
            and ultimately on Soviet guarantees. Contact and intercourse <pb n="315" xml:id="pg_315" facs="0345"/>with the West can probably contribute only marginally to a change in the
            political character and external orientation of the Eastern European regimes.</p>
                    <p>If the political order in Eastern Europe for some considerable period ahead consists of
            a system of national states in hegemonial relationship to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, what contribution can these states make to a settlement of the German
            problem? The answer for Bulgaria, Rumania, and Hungary must be virtually none; even if
            they come to favor German reunification, which is not inconceivable though more likely
            they will be simply indifferent, they would not promote or advocate it against the will
            of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Even if Czechoslovakia liberalizes its
            regime and becomes more accessible to Western influences, as seems increasingly likely,
            it would have no real interest in supporting a German settlement, and could not
            significantly affect the chances for one in any case.</p>
                    <p>Poland is and seems likely to remain unalterably opposed to the reunification of
            Germany. The special feverishness with which this attitude is held is due in some part
            to the weakness in the country of the Communist regime, which finds in anti-German
            sentiments its main political resource. But the attitude would be the same in essence
            even if the Polish Communists held power more securely. The Poles have no desire to
            serve once again as the shuttlecock in a Russian-German power contest. They evidently
            believe that the present arrangement, with a Communist buffer state carved out of
            Germany, gives them greater security and freedom of action than they could enjoy under
            any other arrangement.</p>
                    <p>These Polish attitudes are an additional strong factor in determining the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s insistence upon preserving the division of Germany.
            Should the Soviets for other reasons entertain the idea of consenting to Germany's
            reunification, they would have to face the possibility that such a development could
            place the existence of the Polish Communist regime in jeopardy.</p>
                    <p>It seems likely, therefore, that however much the elaboration of economic and cultural
            ties with Eastern Europe may help to reduce tensions and improve East-West atmospherics,
            the hard sense of an overriding interest in Germany's present division will remain
            unaffected. And this is especially the case where it matters most, in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and Poland.</p>
                    <p>The same general prognosis must apply to West Germany's growing interest in developing
            economic, cultural, and eventually, by a change in the Hallstein doctrine, formal
            diplomatic ties with Eastern Europe. These steps are also unlikely to stimulate real
            incentives in Eastern Europe to support a German settlement. Economic leverage and
            cultural influence can seldom override what is conceived as a serious national
            interest.</p>
                    <pb n="316" xml:id="pg_316" facs="0346"/>
                    <p>The approach by way of enlarging economic-cultural contacts somehow vaguely implies
            that the German problem will not be settled but dissolved—in a process which will see
            the Communist states lose their ideological coloration, a “unity” of all Europe created,
            and national interests cease to have effect. Even if one does not think this entirely
            utopian, he must at least concede that it will take a very long time, and in the
            interval offer the Germans no very sure promise. In short, this approach is not a policy
            aimed at foreseeable consequences; it is a way of living hopefully with the problem.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">D. Interim Conclusion on Alternative Approaches</p>
                    <p>The conclusion implied in the foregoing review of suggested approaches to a German and
            European settlement is that none of them offers any real promise. They all suffer from
            the defect that they give the East no incentive for altering its view that the status
            quo serves its interests better than would any settlement embracing a reunited Germany.
            That is why Communist policy is directed to buttressing, legalizing, and normalizing the
            status quo in every possible way.</p>
                    <p>The premise of this latter policy is that Communist power in East Germany can be made
            viable for the long pull. Only if this should not prove true, only if the effort to
            sustain the Communist regime seemed likely to become more costly and dangerous than a
            settlement reunifying Germany, would the Soviets and Poles have any real incentive for
            consenting to such a settlement.</p>
                    <p rend="center">III. The Key Question: Possible Developments in East Germany</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. The Viability of the East German Regime</p>
                    <p>The key questions bearing on the future of the German problem are therefore the
            following: Will the East German regime in fact prove viable indefinitely? What political
            changes are likely to take place within it over the long term? What can the Federal
            Republic and the West do to promote changes which would favor an all-German
            settlement?</p>
                    <p>The vulnerabilities of the East German regime are manifest—its lack of national appeal
            and of legitimacy based on popular mandate as compared with West Germany, its Wall as
            graphic demonstration of these facts, its ultimate dependence on Soviet military power.
            Though now apparently improbable, it can never be ruled out that this brittle pretense
            of a state might one day be faced with popular resistance. Soviet military power could,
            of course, cope with this contingency, but it would confront the Soviets in acute form
            with the question of whether the costs and risks of the effort to maintain this regime
            were worth its value to them. Probably they would still think it was, but it is also
            conceivable that the Soviet attitude toward Germany could change in consequence of such
            an episode. A flexible Western policy at such a moment might induce the Soviets to take
            serious steps toward a final German settlement.</p>
                    <pb n="317" xml:id="pg_317" facs="0347"/>
                    <p>A more fruitful area of speculation relates to what changes may occur within the East
            German regime over a prolonged period. Will its leadership group continue to believe in
            and have the will to maintain a separate state existence? Or will the Soviets be
            increasingly hard put to find a leadership even as capable as the present one?</p>
                    <p>It is a fact that East Germany has a more vigorous and promising appearance today than
            it did, say five years ago. Doctrinaire inanities in economic planning and
            administration have been done away with and a respectable if not sensational trend of
            economic advance attained. It is even reported, though one must remain skeptical of
            this, that the East German population manifests an increasing degree of identification
            with East Germany as a separate state entity.</p>
                    <p>Probably it is true that over a long period the discontents of the population will be
            less a threat to this regime than the quality and commitment of its leadership. It was
            created by men, with <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> as their archetype,
            who thought of themselves as Soviet apparatchiks first and Germans second. The successor
            generation of leaders may be men of a different cut, in which case the internal
            political life of this regime could become very complicated, perhaps even quite
            unstable. In any case, if the trend towards national autonomy and internal
            liberalization continues elsewhere in Eastern Europe, the regime in East Germany will
            tend to have an increasingly anomalous character.</p>
                    <p>It might, but would not necessarily, nor even probably, collapse from this defect,
            though it might become a growing embarrassment to the Soviets. They, however, do not
            embarrass easily, and probably would still find men long after <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> who were able and willing to govern such a state.
            On the whole, it seems wiser to assume the continuing viability of the East German
            regime rather than to count on its internal evolution in ways which would make German
            reunification easier to achieve.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. The Policy of “Isolating” East Germany</p>
                    <p>Advocates of the approaches to the German problem discussed above generally say that it
            is a necessary concomitant of those policies that the Federal Republic and the West must
            work for the “isolation” of East Germany. The inference is that this means something
            more than merely continuing the present policy of diplomatic non-recognition. How
            realistic is “isolation” and how effective is it likely to be in changing Soviet
            attitudes or in acting on political conditions within East Germany so as to reduce the
            viability of the regime?</p>
                    <p>The real tendency of West German attitudes in fact now runs opposite to any effort to
            enforce greater isolation on East Germany. Bonn is, of course, not moving toward
            conceding legitimacy to the regime. But West German politicians are responding to what
            appears to be an increasingly <pb n="318" xml:id="pg_318" facs="0348"/>impatient desire
            on the part of the West Germans, especially younger people, for more human contacts. For
            their part, the East German leaders deem it prudent to respond at least cautiously to
            similar pressures in their population, and they may be willing to go further if economic
            advance is sustained. The prospect probably is that, as Germans confront more frankly
            the fact that unity through action of the Four Powers remains remote, such pressure will
            increase rather than diminish. Greater contacts may or may not have any significant
            political consequences in East Germany, but they are in any case incompatible with a
            policy of stricter isolation.</p>
                    <p>With economic advance in East Germany, the volume of interzonal trade will probably
            increase and the interests associated with it in West Germany are likely to favor more
            normal relations. As East Germany becomes able to develop significant trade with other
            Western states, the West Germans may feel obliged to handle interzonal trade more
            generously and in a more formal framework, even at the cost of some implied
            “recognition” for East Germany. Altogether, the trends now operating seem likely, over a
            prolonged period, to favor a gradual movement toward normalization of relations rather
            than an increased effort by West Germany to isolate the Communist regime.</p>
                    <p>Such a change would not necessarily mean that the West Germans were phasing over into
            acceptance both of the Pankow regime and of the indefinite division of Germany. They
            could describe it to themselves as a policy of engagement which had become necessary due
            to changed conditions but which still sought the same aims. They could continue to
            refrain from formal recognition on the ground that the East German regime, never having
            obtained a genuine popular mandate, has no real claim to legitimacy. Contact and
            presence in East Germany could nevertheless be pressed as a step toward the goal of
            unity to which even the East Germans pay lip service. Such a policy would no doubt soon
            find the East German leaders back-pedaling furiously from their pretense that they were
            the ones who sought contact and normalization. At the very least, their internal
            political position would be weakened and complicated.</p>
                    <p>Such a change in Bonn's policy would not affect the Soviets' attitude or their basic
            interest in maintaining the Pankow regime. They would advise Pankow to advance
            cautiously on the road of normal relations, seeking to construe these in accordance with
            standard Soviet theses on the future of Germany. One by-product, however, might be an
            easing of Berlin problems.</p>
                    <p>Should the West Germans eventually move toward such a course of normalization and
            engagement, we would not need to be alarmed and it probably would not be prudent to
            attempt to discourage them. We cannot honestly say that the present policy of
            halfhearted, legalistically defined “ <pb n="319" xml:id="pg_319" facs="0349"/>isolation” will have greater effect in moving the German problem toward
            settlement.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, it is not a course which we can urge either, since in the present
            state of German opinion we would only sow confusion and misunderstanding, and perhaps
            become embroiled in party politics. We ought to be prepared, however, to see German
            attitudes change as the long stalemate drags on, and perhaps especially after Ulbricht
            leaves the scene.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">IV. Implications for US Policy Toward West Germany</p>
                    <p>If it is true that the problem of divided Germany will not in the foreseeable future
            yield to settlement by any policies open to the West to pursue, then our vitally
            important relations with the Federal Republic must be handled with all priority, care,
            and delicacy. There is no great danger that the West Germans will move to come to terms
            with the Soviets or undertake some act of desperation. But there is some possibility
            eventually of political demoralization and internal divisions which could make the
            Federal Republic a burden and a problem for the West rather than the asset it is today.
            American relations with Bonn are basically sound at present, but some suggestions can be
            made which may help to insure that those relations withstand the dangers and challenges
            of the long period ahead during which the “German problem” is likely still to be with
            us.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. The Quality of the Relationship</p>
                    <p>Although contacts between West Germans and Americans have been numerous enough, one
            senses that they have not been marked by any special intimacy. All too frequently,
            comprehension and communication break down and lead to flurries of misunderstanding and
            even mistrust in the German press.</p>
                    <p>There are obvious historical, cultural, and psychological reasons for the somewhat
            distant quality that seems to characterize the relationship. Certainly the Germans ought
            not to be as sensitive and mistrustful as they are. Their leaders ought to cultivate a
            more courageous and “democratic” style in dealing with public opinion and the press. But
            for our part, we ought not to burden the relationship psychologically by bringing to it
            the unspoken but not unnoticed assumption that the Germans may once again become the
            sick children of Europe, and that their care and feeding is a matter of nervous concern
            to us.</p>
                    <p>On the level of official and political contact we ought at least to aim for the kind of
            candor that has obtained in the Anglo-American relationship. The German leaders know,
            and know that we know, that their national problem cannot be solved now, nor probably
            for a very long time. Acknowledgment of this reality in private dialogue does not mean
            that we are any the less committed to their interest; it might help to undergird <pb n="320" xml:id="pg_320" facs="0350"/>genuine trust if the common tasks could be
            frankly addressed from this starting point. One wholesome by-product might be that the
            German leaders would be emboldened to communicate more candidly with their own people
            and thus help to steady German opinion for the long pull.</p>
                    <p>The suggestion here is not that our present relations with West Germany are seriously
            unsatisfactory. It is that, in view of the prospect ahead, a steady and deliberate
            effort to improve the quality of the relationship at all levels will be in our interest.
            It would also be helpful if other allies did the same, especially the British.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. West Germany's Role in the West</p>
                    <p>It scarcely needs reiteration that the Germans must have a responsible role in the
            common undertakings of the West. They will take a more wholesome view of their national
            situation if their part in the affairs of the Western community is the significant one
            which their power and resources warrant. If a settlement of the German problem can in
            the end only come about through a long process of change in Eastern Europe, their
            intimate association with the West will be a help to this process and not a hindrance.
            And if it does come about in this way, the stability of a Europe made whole again will
            be all the more sure.</p>
                    <p>The precise institutional forms of West Germany's association with the West are less
            important than that she be part of a West which is as politically united as possible.
            Divisions within the West which force the Germans to take sides carry the risk of
            persuading them that the Western association will not after all serve their national
            interest, and carry also the danger of stimulating the sort of political demoralization
            referred to above.</p>
                    <p>Various projects for Western European and Atlantic “integration” may be desirable, but
            they are probably not urgent enough to justify such risks, assuming that they can be
            consummated by a forcing process at all. Integration has one other risk of which we
            should be wary. It may lead some Germans to say that this is a device for binding down a
            permanently partitioned Germany, a manifestation of continued Western mistrust of the
            Germans.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">C. West Germany's Eastern Policy</p>
                    <p>It was argued earlier in this paper that the more active policy in Eastern Europe which
            Bonn is increasingly disposed to pursue is unlikely to have any decisive effect in
            advancing a German settlement. Nevertheless, we ought to encourage it.</p>
                    <p>We should do so in part because of the effects on the West Germans themselves. The
            sense of being active in their own interest will assuage their chronic distemper over
            being merely the “object” of the policies of others. They will have a more concrete
            appreciation of the obstacles to a <pb n="321" xml:id="pg_321" facs="0351"/>German
            settlement, and perhaps be less inclined to suspect inadequacies in the American
            effort.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, it is possible that in certain unanticipated circumstances a larger West
            German presence and influence in Eastern Europe could have some beneficial effect in
            advancing a German settlement. If Western policy cannot do much positively at present to
            bring about a settlement, it can at least be alert to exploit any break in Eastern
            Europe which might open up possibilities not now evident. Some issues in international
            politics are not solved by gradualism but by a sudden crystallization of new factors.
            Political deterioration in East Germany or some form of internal crisis in the USSR
            might be such factors; there may be others we cannot now imagine. The fact that the West
            Germans were on the scene and known in Eastern Europe rather than seen as a distant
            bogey might some day prove helpful.</p>
                    <p>What particular steps the Germans should take in developing their policy toward Eastern
            Europe is a difficult question and any advice we provide should be delivered with tact
            and careful timing. The “policy of movement” appears still hazy in the minds of its
            advocates. It is subject to partisan controversy in which we would not wish to become
            involved.</p>
                    <p>The primary target of the German effort should be Poland, since, apart from the
            Soviets, the Poles would have most to say about any change in Eastern attitudes on the
            German problem. For reasons given earlier, it will be difficult to initiate a meaningful
            dialogue at all. In order to do so, the Germans will probably at some point have to make
            a clean-cut statement recognizing Poland's present Western frontier. They should do this
            if they are at all serious about an active policy in Eastern Europe. It is fantasy to
            pretend that this “concession” can be held out as a bargaining counter in some eventual
            negotiation of a final settlement.</p>
                    <p>There are other things the Germans could do to enlarge their access to Eastern Europe.
            They could forthrightly renounce national acquisition of nuclear weapons. Schroeder's
            recent attempt to toy with this by making it conditional on reunification can do nothing
            but harm to the Eastern policy he proposes; put this way, nobody in Eastern Europe will
            be reassured. The Germans could also give up the ambiguous but ominous references to
            Heimatrecht for purposes of domestic politicking. It would improve the face the Germans
            present to the East if the Socialists gained access to the government, though this
            obviously rests on other considerations and could not be devised for purposes of foreign
            policy alone.</p>
                    <p>The Germans do not normally speak of embracing the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in a “policy of movement” toward the East. But they must hope that one
            of its results would be an opportunity to talk more meaningfully with the Soviets. We
            would not need to take alarm at this if it actually happened. There cannot be a ground
            of common interest between the Soviets and <pb n="322" xml:id="pg_322" facs="0352"/>Germans who seek the unity and freedom of their country. Only if the political
            complexion of the Federal Republic underwent a profound change and the country came to
            be governed by Germans willing to accept Soviet tutelage, at the cost incidentally of
            all the ties and interests which now bind it to the West, is it possible to imagine a
            development of Soviet-German relations prejudicial to Western interests. This is an
            extremely remote danger and will remain so if the West stays close to the Germans and
            provides them a worthy place in its councils.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">V. Conclusions and Summary</p>
                    <p>The view of the German problem and of the indicated American policies set forth in this
            paper has the following principal elements:</p>
                    <p>1. A settlement based on the reunification of Germany in freedom cannot in the
            foreseeable future be obtained by any policy approach the West can now pursue. This
            applies to new initiatives for negotiation, to regional arms control and security
            measures, and to the development of economic and other contacts in Eastern Europe.</p>
                    <p>2. The Soviet and Polish attitudes, the only ones that really matter, rest on a belief
            that the status quo is essential to their national interests. Their views will not
            change unless the costs and risks of the present situation seem likely to become greater
            than those of a general settlement, or unless they themselves undergo a profound
            internal political change and the cold war is in effect terminated.</p>
                    <p>3. Present Communist policy rests on a calculation that the East German regime will
            remain viable indefinitely. This is probably correct, but there is some chance that it
            is not, owing to that regime's unique vulnerabilities and to possible change in the
            character of its leadership. In any event, such policies of “isolation” as the West
            Germans are likely to pursue would have little effect. Bonn may in fact turn eventually
            to normalization of relations, while still withholding formal recognition and still
            pressing for reunification.</p>
                    <p>4. It would not be in our interest to oppose such a change in West German tactics.
            However, American policy should continue to declare that German reunification on the
            basis of self-determination is an essential ingredient of the East-West settlement we
            seek. There is declining advantage in doing this by way of formal appeals to the Soviets
            to resume Four-Power negotiations, and such initiatives, or at least their timing,
            should take account of other aspects of our dealings with the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>5. Because we can do little to move the German problem toward settlement, the
            cultivation of a sound and intimate relationship with the Federal Republic must have the
            highest priority. This means in particular working for an adequate role for West Germany
            in the affairs of the West, and playing a tactful part in relation to Bonn's attempt to
            develop a more active Eastern policy.</p>
                    <pb n="323" xml:id="pg_323" facs="0353"/>
                    <p>The German problem offers no promising outlook. For the present, it appears to be one
            of those issues in international politics which has mainly to be lived with until the
            political forces surrounding it change in some profound way which cannot now be
            foreseen. If American policy in the world as a whole meets with reasonable success,
            presumably it will help to promote such change.</p>

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> predicted that Chancellor
              <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> and the GDU would win the September 19
            elections, and continue to govern. The envisioned “Grand Coalition” (between <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss>) would not
            materialize. <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Willy Brandt</persName> has been unable to
            seize any issues or offer a real choice in the campaign.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> discounted many of the
            campaign statements made by former Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> has been bitter
            re the United States “since the election of John Kennedy,” he said, and increasingly
            pro-Gaullist. (But even <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> has been lately
            critical of deGaulle and twice has publicly criticized him. Gaullism was weakening, in
            general, inside Germany.)</p>
                    <p>Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> remains staunchly
            pro-American and pro-Atlantic. In fact, Erhard readily admits he was “made in America”
            and placed in German politics by U.S. military government. His policies after the
            election will continue to be moderate. He was most favorably impressed by his visit to
            the <gloss target="#t_LBJ1">LBJ</gloss> ranch, and hopes the President will be able to
            reciprocate the visit.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">U.S. Policy Toward Germany</p>
                    <p>The Vice President posed the question for consideration: Is our European and Atlantic
            policy conditioned too greatly on what Germany might or might not accept?</p>
                    <pb n="324" xml:id="pg_324" facs="0354"/>
                    <p>The Ambassador replied that he thought not. There are those in Germany, be said, who
            feel indeed the opposite—that Germany is a U.S. puppet and that German policy is too
            often formulated on a basis of pleasing the United States.</p>
                    <p>In reality, the Ambassador said, there is a great identity of interest for the U.S. and
            Germany and that, 90 per cent of the time, we are in agreement to begin with. Our
            policies coincide, he said, because they serve both our interests.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Nuclear-Sharing and <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>
                    </p>
                    <p>The Vice President asked whether the Federal Republic really wanted the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. The Ambassador replied that Germany did not necessarily
            want the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> per se, but that Germany did seek some
            arrangement of nuclear sharing for two reasons:</p>
                    <p>1. It would give Germany political equality with France and Great Britain, both of whom
            possess nuclear forces; and</p>
                    <p>2. It would give Germany a greater guarantee of military security.</p>
                    <p>On the second point, the Ambassador said most reponsible Germans felt that
            participation in a nuclear-sharing arrangement or multilateral force would insure that
            Germany would be left with some protection in event of a non-proliferation agreement—if
            a non-proliferation agreement were reached today, Germany might feel completely on the
            outside, looking in. Her only protection would be the U.S. guarantee.</p>
                    <p>The U.S. sold the German government on the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> concept,
            the Ambassador said, and then when “the rug was pulled out from under them,” both
            Schroeder and <persName corresp="#p_HKU1">Von Hassel</persName> took a beating at
            home.</p>
                    <p>There is no sense of urgency in Germany at present re nuclear sharing, the Ambassador
            said. However, the Ambassador felt we should take initiative toward further discussion
            of the problem. He suggested, as a starting point, the calling of a high-level meeting
            early next year in framework of the Paris Working Group to renew initiative toward some
            solution. The Ambassador frankly felt that the assignment of more Polaris missiles to
            the Mediterranean, under <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, would reassure the
            Germans militarily—at least for the next two or three years. It was possible that the
            desire for nuclear sharing could, in fact, be satisfied with greater participation in
            nuclear command and control, targeting and planning. The U.S. should, he said, make
            clearly known its offer to “work something out” so that we did not appear to be the
            all-powerful big brothers of the Alliance, imposing our will on our partners.</p>

                    <p>The Vice President asked whether the Ambassador thought General deGaulle meant to
            permanently sabotage the <persName>Kennedy Round</persName> trade negotiation. The
            Ambassador replied that he thought this would be too <pb n="325" xml:id="pg_325" facs="0355"/>great a blow against France's five <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>
            partners, who favored the <persName>Kennedy Round</persName>.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President asked whether the Ambassador felt deGaulle would demand the removal
            of <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> President Hallstein and Vice President Mansholt
            as his price for remaining in the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>. The Ambassador
            said that this, too, would press France's partners too far. The Germans, particularly,
            could not accept such a demand re Hallstein.</p>
                    <p>If France continues its policies of threat and ultimatum within the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>, she will ultimately alienate the rest of Europe, the
            Ambassador said.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Eastern Europe</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador felt Germany was increasingly liberalizing her attitude toward relations
            with Eastern Europe. He pointed to the large amount of German-East European trade. He
            pointed out that Germany was highly upset concerning long-term commercial arrangements
            concluded with the East by the U.K. The Vice President replied that he was upset, too.
            Common Western policies were badly needed in this regard.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Visits to Europe (Private Discussion)</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador said he felt Western Europe badly needed some important signs of U.S.
            interest and commitment. He had hoped for some time that President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> could make an official visit to Western
            Europe.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President asked for the Ambassador's candid opinion regarding the usefulness
            of a visit by himself to Western Europe. The Ambassador said he thought it would be
            useful, but that it might create circumstances which would cause a delay in a
            Presidential visit—and the Presidential visit was badly needed.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President said that this was his opinion, too. He disclosed, privately, that
            there had been discussion regarding possible foreign travel by himself. He felt,
            personally, that visits to Africa and Asia might be most useful to the national
            interest. He thought the President should visit Latin America and Europe as soon as
            possible—perhaps a European trip in early December.</p>
                    <p>Both the Vice President and Ambassador agreed to work toward stimulation of such a
            European visit by the President.</p>

                    <p>The conversation at dinner was general and discussion of substantive matters was
            limited. <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> seemed relatively relaxed and
            affable, but he was not disposed to get into political questions. The following subject
            was touched upon.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Germany</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> wondered what the Soviet attitude would be
            concerning German reunification if the two problems of the German boundaries and of
            access to nuclear weapons were solved. He thought these were the two basic questions of
            concern to the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary questioned whether this was accurate; he was inclined to feel that the
            Soviets were more concerned about the over-all problem of their dominant position in
            Eastern Europe. If there is a plebiscite in East Germany, the Soviets know it will go
            against the <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> regime and they fear that the
            impact of this could roll back Soviet influence throughout Eastern Europe. The Soviets
            do not wish to gamble their position in this area on German self-determination.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> suggested that the best prospect for
            Germany might lie in having the “two German states” (he said he could use this phrase
            since no West Germans were present) proceed to establish a pattern of increased contacts
            and political relations between themselves. If this occurred, he predicted that within
            five years reunification would occur without the necessity for a plebiscite.</p>
                    <pb n="327" xml:id="pg_327" facs="0357"/>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCE2">Bohlen</persName> remarked that he had always
            felt <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> had made a mistake in refusing to
            deal at all with East Germany in the mid-50s. <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> said he thought that even now it was not too late for this to
            begin.</p>

                    <p>Dear Mr. Secretary:</p>
                    <p>As I mentioned to you when I saw you in Washington last month<note n="2" xml:id="d130fn2">According to <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>'s Appointment
              Book, the meeting took place at 10 a.m. on September 1. (Johnson Library) No record of
              the discussion was found.</note> we have, here in the Embassy and in consultation with
            our Mission in Berlin, been working on a paper analyzing how the United States can best
            handle the German reunification issue—under the various circumstances which may arise.
            We assume that the Germans will raise this question with us after the formation of
            Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s new government later in the
            month—and in the Chancellor's meeting with the President which will probably take place
            in November. This paper has now been completed and is enclosed for your information, in
            the form of a Memorandum on German Reunification. The paper devotes itself to both
            substance and tactics, of which the latter appears to us be the more important. I hope
            that it can contribute usefully to the consideration which I know that you personally,
            and others in the Department, have been giving to this problem.</p>
                    <p>We have all learned from past experience how very sensitive the reunification issue is.
            Should it become known that the American Embassy in Bonn has prepared a paper along the
            lines of the enclosed Memorandum, there would be immediate adverse repercussions in
            Germany. I am accordingly restricting distribution of the Memorandum to seven copies. In
            addition to the one enclosed, copies are being sent on a personal Eyes Only basis to the
            Under Secretary, Tommy Thompson, <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">John Leddy</persName>,
              <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName>, and to <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Foy Kohler</persName> in Moscow. The remaining copy will be retained in the Embassy.
            I urge that no other copies be made.</p>

                    <p rend="center">Introduction</p>
                    <p>As was pointed out in Embtel 19 of July 2, 1965,<note n="4" xml:id="d130fn4">
                            <ref target="#d124">Document 124</ref>.</note> reunification will remain a basic
            objective of the Federal Republic. It is believed that its emotional appeal for the
            German people will in the future be more likely to increase than to decrease. Any German
            Government will need to devote energetic attention to this subject and can be expected
            to look to Germany's Allies, particularly the United States, for support and assistance
            in this regard. There is, however, no consensus in Germany as to how—if at
            all—reunification can be achieved. Rather, thinking generally centers on two entirely
            different approaches to reunification.</p>
                    <p>A. The first approach, which until now the Federal Government has favored, foresees a
            new initiative with the Soviets in which substantive proposals (as distinct from
            procedural proposals or purely demonstrative proposals) for achieving reunification
            would be put forward. In pushing this idea, however, the Federal Government has been
            reluctant to define the German position on a number of the critical subjects which would
            have to be covered in any serious discussions with the Soviets on reunification. For
            this reason, the Government has been subject to criticism for pursuing an ineffectual
            policy. The opposition Social Democrats have been among those sharply critical of the
            Government in this respect. At one point during the election campaign they came out in
            favor of an initiative with the Soviets. They proposed that this take the form of a
            peace treaty which, before presentation to the Soviets, would have been the subject of
            consultation with the Three Western Allies. However, under attack from the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> withdrew its
            support from this proposal. (It will be recalled that Governing Mayor Brandt has in the
            past publicly favored a Western initiative in the form of a call for a peace
            conference.)</p>
                    <p>B. The second general approach to reunification foresees progress mainly in increased
            contacts between the two parts of Germany. This point of view is usually based on the
            premise that Soviet agreement to reunification is, within the foreseeable future,
            extremely doubtful. <pb n="329" xml:id="pg_329" facs="0359"/>Therefore, the most
            promising course of action in bringing the Germans on both sides of the demarcation line
            into more comparable circumstances and closer together is one of “little steps” and,
            eventually, hopefully, “larger steps” aimed at increasing intercourse in all fields
            between East and West Germany. This would not, however, go so far as political
            recognition of the East German regime. The <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> and the
              <gloss target="#t_FDP1">FDP</gloss>, in their present policies, favor both a
            substantive initiative with the Soviets and, at the same time, greater direct contact
            with the East Germans. The <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> does not reject the idea
            of greater contact with East German residents, but gives the impression of being drawn
            along in a policy of such “small steps” as the pass agreement with the East Germans,
            because of public pressure rather than real conviction. As a matter of fact, the
              <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName>-Guttenberg faction opposes this policy as dangerous and
            self-defeating.</p>
                    <p>Looking to the future, the United States will need to be in a position to react to both
            approaches to German reunification. In so doing, our principal objectives should be the
            following:</p>
                    <p>A. We should attempt to satisfy, to the maximum extent possible without jeopardizing
            other American foreign policy interests, the German desire for forward movement on the
            German question. The Germans will remain perennially suspicious that their allies are
            not really interested in the achievement of German reunification; that they, on the
            contrary, would be willing to accept the status quo in Germany as part of some over-all
            understanding with the Soviets. We must continually make efforts to counter this German
            tendency—annoying though it may be—since it could in time lead the Germans toward a
            nationalist policy, entailing serious dangers for the West.</p>
                    <p>B. We should continue to keep clearly on the record that it is the Soviets who remain
            responsible for the division of Germany, and that their uncompromising German policy and
            their harsh statements about the Federal Republic stem from the Soviet desire to justify
            to the world their continued enforced division of Germany.</p>
                    <p>C. We should attempt to make whatever progress may be possible toward lessening the
            potential danger which the continued division of Germany entails. The tensions thereby
            created in Central Europe, where there exists the only direct Soviet-US confrontation,
            constitute a serious threat to world peace.</p>
                    <p>The present paper is an effort to suggest how the United States can seek to achieve
            these objectives, under conditions likely to prevail during the next few years which
            will see Germany under a <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_CSU1">CSU</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_FDP1">FDP</gloss> coalition. It includes a review of
            past US, German and Soviet positions on reunification, a suggestion as to how we might
            deal with the German authorities on the question of a new substantive initiative and
            certain ideas on an alternate procedure should a substantive initiative not prove
            feasible <pb n="330" xml:id="pg_330" facs="0360"/>or desirable. In addition, annexes are
            attached outlining what the United States might be able to accept as part of a
            substantive initiative and describing the logical sequence of events under a
            reunification plan should an initiative meet with success.</p>

              <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">M. Bundy</persName>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. Preparations for <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> Visit</p>
                    <p>There are a number of important issues for discussion with <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>—France and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, offset agreements and troop levels, funds for under-developed countries,
            policy toward Russia, reunification, trade and finance. But the one which needs urgent
            discussion today is Atlantic nuclear defense policy and the German place within it.</p>
                    <p>Three views have developed in recent weeks in Washington. One is that it is important
            to have US leadership in pressing for a “hardware” solution—a collective nuclear force
            in which the Germans would buy a share and in which they could look forward to
            mixed-manning and increasing responsibility. This solution is strongly preferred by
            Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>, who would couple it with
            resolute pressure upon Great Britain to give up a finger on the trigger of an
            independent nuclear force.</p>
                    <p>The second school of thought which includes <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> would argue strongly against pressing for a hardware solution now
            and would prefer a candid statement to the Germans that no such solution seems
            immediately possible since there is no consensus whatever on its shape or form <pb n="331" xml:id="pg_331" facs="0361"/>in Europe. This school believes that the Germans
            mislead themselves about the real meaning and value of such a hardware solution and that
            it would be wrong to proceed now even if we could easily get the agreement of other
            Europeans. This school would prefer to seek maximum value from increased consultation on
            matters of intelligence, targetting, planning, budgeting, and weapons system design.
            This school would not foreclose an eventual shared weapons system and would not give up
            existing US language in the non-dissemination treaty at German expense.<note n="3" xml:id="d131fn3">Marginal notes by <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">McGeorge
                Bundy</persName> that begin in the left margin next to the third paragraph read: “A
              basic reason for discussion now.” “What do we say after Erhard visit. Surface words
              are easy, but general words are hard—even impossible unless they are agreed.”</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> would support a hardware
            solution if it is the President's judgment that such a solution deserves intense and
            continuous US pressure for its achievement. If not, he would prefer a decision now that
            we do not expect a hardware solution.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> recognizes also that we cannot
            afford a feeling of betrayal among the Germans. Unlike <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName>, who believe that this issue requires prompt
            decision, the Secretary has kept open the possibility that the matter might be discussed
            right through the coming winter. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and
              <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> will be in Europe in the last week in
              November,<note n="4" xml:id="d131fn4">

                    <p>At your request, I am sending you some observations on Schroeder and <persName corresp="#p_HKU1">Von Hassel</persName>.</p>
                    <pb n="332" xml:id="pg_332" facs="0362"/>
                    <p>Psychoanalyzing foreign statesmen is a notoriously difficult task. In the Federal
            Republic it is complicated further by the fact that the political spectrum has been
            distorted by the defeat in World War II and the trauma of the Nazi period. Traditional
            nationalism has had to find a home in middle-of-the-road parties and must be pursued
            with more embracing slogans—of which Atlanticism is one.</p>
                    <p>Schroeder and <persName corresp="#p_HKU1">Von Hassel</persName> seem to me to fit
            this generalization: Schroeder as an active manipulator, <persName corresp="#p_HKU1">Von Hassel</persName> in a more passive role. Both are North German, Protestant,
            Prussian—distrustful of France, nostalgic towards Britain, profoundly national in
            orientation. Strauss is a condottiere: he wants the maximum influence of whatever unit
            he represents and he will be brutal in pursuing it. But he has no particular interest
            where the frontiers of this unit are. Schroeder and <persName corresp="#p_HKU1">Von
              Hassel</persName> feel personally unfulfilled as long as Germany remains divided.
            Schroeder told an absolutely reliable acquaintance of mine once: “Not a day goes by but
            that I think of Koenigsberg (now the Soviet city of Kalinengrad) as a German city.”</p>
                    <p>These primary objectives must always be kept in mind in explaining Schroeder's—and to a
            lesser extent—<persName corresp="#p_HKU1">Von Hassel</persName>'s nationalism.
            Schroe-der is anti-French because he considers it foolish to subordinate Germany to a
            second-class European power and a traditional enemy to boot. In building up Germany he
            wants to rely on the most modern technology. His vision of Atlanticism may go something
            like this: If the United States supports German national aims, Germany will have the
            backing of the strongest country in the West. If the United States fails to do so, the
            Federal Republic will have become the strongest European country with American help. It
            will be in a position to be the dominant country in Western Europe. German national
            interest—not the integrationist concept of Atlanticism—may thus be the driving
            force.</p>
                    <p>Schroeder's record indicates that he is a cool operator, proud of his tactical skill,
            determined not to be in an exposed position. Every gaffe of <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s has been accompanied by press leaks from his
            Foreign Minister absolving himself of responsibility. It is also well to remember that
            until 1961 Schroeder as Minister of Interior stood on the Right Wing of the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>. He was detested by the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss>; indeed grouped by them with <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> as their arch-enemy. He was a staunch supporter of <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>. Within months of being appointed Foreign
            Minister in 1961—on the basis of his presumed loyalty to <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>—he began undercutting the Chancellor and wooing the Socialists.
            Schroeder is not an ally on which to count when the going gets tough—as Hallstein is
            learning now.</p>
                    <p>As for <persName corresp="#p_HKU1">Von Hassel</persName>, it is well to remember
            that he returned to Germany from East Africa at the height of the Nazi period. This does
            not make him a Nazi—it can be explained in a non-Nazi only by very strong
            nationalism.</p>
                    <pb n="333" xml:id="pg_333" facs="0363"/>
                    <p>To sum up: We are playing recklessly with fire. France is difficult but it has no
            unfulfilled national aims. Germany is in a different position. Its goals must be
            revisionist. Its leaders are growing increasingly assertive—partly because of American
            encouragement. We are substituting a German for a French problem, one that will prove
            much more dangerous in the years ahead.</p>

                    <p>1907. For Secretary, Under Secretary, Amb <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName>, Rostow.</p>
                    <p>1. In response Amb <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName>'s request, I would
            offer following comments on his thoughtful memorandum on German reunification.<note n="2" xml:id="d133fn2">
                            <ref target="#d131">Document 131</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>2. I agree we must continue seek allay German suspicions that Allies not really
            interested in reunification. We should therefore keep issue alive and raise it with
            Soviets on every suitable occasion, as has been done, of course, by Secretary in his
            conversations with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> over past five years
            and most recently in New York, as well as by <persName corresp="#p_SM12">Stewart</persName> during his visit here last week. We will thus continue to keep
            record clear that responsibility for continued division of Germany rests with
            Soviets.</p>
                    <p>3. I also agree that in pursuing above objective we must, of course, not jeopardize
            other U.S. foreign policy objectives. Soviets are now (and, I suspect, will be for some
            time to come) disinterested in reunification and desirous maintain status quo in Central
            Europe. I therefore see no reason for us to take any initiative which, given this Soviet
            position, bound to fail and would only force differences existing among allies and with
            Germans on various aspects of issue. Moreover, I see no reason why we should arouse
            Soviets on thorny problem which they themselves seem prefer leave dormant at this time.
            Despite vehemence their anti-<gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> propaganda, Soviets
            clearly not seeking open “second front,” as it were, in Germany in connection their
            disagreement with us over Vietnam, and such front is certainly not in our interest
            either.</p>
                    <pb n="334" xml:id="pg_334" facs="0364"/>
                    <p>4. I see no percentage for anyone at this time in any formal procedural initiative.
            Chances of Soviet acceptance such initiative are nil, as shown by <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s reaction to Secretary's and <persName corresp="#p_SM12">Stewart</persName>'s probing re possibility Four-Power talks as
            recently as last October and last week, respectively (Embtel 1890, Dec 10),<note n="3" xml:id="d133fn3">Dated December 10. (Department of State, Central Files, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>)</note> and it
            is hard to see what Bonn could derive domestically from such unpromising initiative
            except increased demands for further and more far-reaching moves requiring painful
            decision.</p>
                    <p>5. As Amb <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName>'s memo points out, Soviets
            seem to take broader view of quadripartism than East Germans, and they have repeatedly
            stated that while Four Powers could not solve reunification, they could facilitate it.
            In view of this, Bonn's interest in having Quadripartite umbrella for bilateral West
            German-East German negotiation could perhaps be met by simply assuming any such
            negotiations were in fact being conducted under Four-Power aegis. As recently as
            yesterday <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> explicitly reaffirmed
            continuing validity Potsdam Agreement, and such implicit arrangement covering <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> contacts would be
            difficult for Soviets to denounce.</p>
                    <p>6. Meanwhile, I believe we should continue quietly to encourage Germans to sort out
            their own thoughts on various short and long range issues relating to reunification
            problem. This connection, I note from Bonn's 1683 to <gloss target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss>
                        <note n="4" xml:id="d133fn4">Dated December 8. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 7 <gloss target="#t_GER1">GER</gloss> W)</note> that exchange of
            messages between German and Polish Bishops may have set a hopeful trend in this
            direction, and I fully agree that we should make every effort to ensure that these
            possible opportunities be fully utilized.</p>

              Reunification</item>

                        <hi rend="italic">Summary:</hi> The two-hour after-dinner discussion on the German
            question followed orthodox lines. Only one seemingly new element was introduced by the
            Secretary when he suggested that German policy may mean more for the Soviets than a way
            of holding on to East Germany—perhaps, in the Soviet view, all of Eastern Europe is at
            stake. The Secretary suggested—and all present agreed—that the Western Allies should
            devote more attention to an examination of this and related questions.</p>
                    <p>Schroeder began the discussion by analyzing what he felt were the two main objectives
            of Soviet German policy:</p>
                    <p>1. Denuclearization and isolation of Germany.</p>
                    <p>2. Destruction of the Federal Republic's ties with Berlin; an example of this was seen
            during the April harassment of the Bundestag meetings in Berlin.</p>
                    <p>Schroeder felt that German policy enjoys top priority in Moscow's Foreign Policy. He
            had noticed two contrasting tones of the Soviets; in confidential talks their manner is
            entirely different than the polemical approach used by <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> in his most recent address to the Supreme Soviet.<note n="3" xml:id="d134fn3">Extracts of the relevant portions are in <hi rend="italic">American

                    <p>In September in Moscow, <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> received a
            polite response in the economic area but in political areas the atmosphere was as
            negative as ever.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister felt that the Soviet Zone of occupation has improved both its
            internal and international positions in recent months as evidenced by several
            significant events:</p>
                    <p>1. The Zone regime has become a leading trade partner of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, and indeed important in world production;</p>
                    <p>2. The <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> visit to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        <note n="4" xml:id="d134fn4">February 24–March 2.</note> has led to establishment of a
              <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> Consulate General in East Berlin;</p>
                    <p>3. The Olympic Committee's decision to include “<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>”
              participation;<note n="5" xml:id="d134fn5">On October 8, the International Olympic
              Committee announced that East German athletes would be invited to participate as a
              separate team.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> has cleverly exploited the
            Sino-Soviet split so that both Moscow and Peiping support him.</p>
                    <p>As a result of these developments we see increased acerbity in the politics of the
              “<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>”, and we have witnessed the helicopter flights
            over West Berlin during early summer and the strong national overtones of recent “<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>” propaganda. Reportedly <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> went so far recently as to assert that he—<persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>—continued Bismarck's policies!</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister Schroeder claimed that a resistance exists in the “<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>”, but that it is not strong and not organized. For public
            indications of ideological strife in the Zone he would have to cite the Havemann case
            and the Apel suicide<note n="6" xml:id="d134fn6"> Havemann was fired as a professor at
              the University of Berlin after publication of an article critical of Communism. Apel,
              the Chairman of the State Planning Commission, committed suicide after public
              criticism of his management of the East German economy.</note>—not all the details of
            which are yet clear. But it seems certain that Apel resisted exploitation of the Zone by
            the Soviets through unfair terms of trade.</p>
                    <p>In Eastern Europe the Soviets put pressure upon all the States to resist German
            reunification. Czech reluctance to accept a Berlin clause is one result of the pressure.
            In general, the Soviets are attempting to revive anti-German feeling. Yet Moscow ignores
            the Federal Republic's renunciation of <gloss target="#t_ABC1">ABC</gloss> weapons and
            declarations that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> does not intend to acquire
            nuclear arms under national control. In conclusion Mr. Schroeder requested comments on
            his analysis before inviting a discussion on what might be done if there is agreement
            concerning that analysis.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve de Murville</persName> responded with observations
            from his recent Moscow trip:<note n="7" xml:id="d134fn7">
                            <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> visited Moscow October 28–November
              2.</note>

                    <p>1. It is a fact that for the Soviet Union the German problem is not only an essential
            problem but the essential problem. You only have to go to Moscow to see it.</p>
                    <p>2. It's also true that in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> there is great
            anxiety over Germany and a reluctance to change the present situation even after it is
            admitted—and the Soviets do admit this—that some day the situation must be changed one
            way or another.</p>
                    <p>3. The Soviets always stress that their relations with the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> are not good—this is said with apparent regret—the Soviets simply note
            the fact and maintain that as long as there is no confidence it is difficult to make any
            progress. Therefore the situation is just as Dr. Schroeder had analyzed it; <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> wanted to add only that it appeared to him that the
            Soviets admitted this with a note of regret—as if there were little they might do about
            it.</p>
                    <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_GBSPH1">Paul Gore-Booth</persName> observed: The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> did not notice the motif of regret during Minister
              <persName corresp="#p_SM12">Stewart</persName>'s visit.<note n="8" xml:id="d134fn8">
                            <persName corresp="#p_SM12">Stewart</persName> visited Moscow November 30–December
              3.</note> The motives of propaganda were all stereotyped in Moscow. It occurred to the
              <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> that the Soviets might want to sow confusion in the
            West. The Soviets avoided the China question.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> confirmed that the French also noticed
            Soviet avoidance of the China question.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GBSPH1">Gore-Booth</persName>: The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> concluded that the Soviet concentration on Germany was a distraction for
            our benefit.</p>
                    <p>Generally the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>'s analysis agrees with that of Dr.
            Schroeder. It agrees that the East Zone has made progress, but the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> can assure Germany that this has had no effect on British
            policy.</p>
                    <p>British experiences in Eastern European countries are varied, but the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> tries to encourage these states in any way that might tend
            to improve relations with the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. All of these thoughts
            seem to lead to the idea that the Federal Republic's general policy line is correct—and
            one which the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> can only encourage.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> observed that Berlin was never mentioned
            during his visit to Moscow.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GBSPH1">Gore-Booth</persName>: This was the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> experience too. They didn't want to talk about Berlin.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> did not raise the subject
            of Berlin in his New York conversations either.<note n="9" xml:id="d134fn9">September 29
              and October 1. Memoranda of conversation are in Department of State, Conference Files:
              Lot 66 D 347, CF 2547.</note> At the very end he made a point as if it were a
            postscript. He noted that we hadn't talked about Berlin and that it is quiet there, but
            he emphasized that Berlin was nevertheless very important. The Secretary gained the
            impression that something new might be injected—but it never was.</p>
                    <pb n="338" xml:id="pg_338" facs="0368"/>
                    <p>We have the impression that China is a preoccupation with the Soviet Union. Germany is
            important, but perhaps not the most important foreign policy problem for the
            Soviets.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary wished we knew more about Moscow's relations with the countries of
            Eastern Europe. The only thing the Arab States can agree about is Israel. Is something
            similar true of Eastern Europe? Perhaps the presence of Soviet divisions is more
            important to Moscow's policy in Eastern Europe today than five years ago. If those
            divisions were removed what would happen in Eastern Europe? We get an impression from
            Eastern European diplomats that there is a change but it is not yet clear what the
            change is. It is curious that there is no interest among the Soviets in settlement of
            the German problem or in reunification, even though the German problem remains the major
            outstanding East-West difference. Since 1947 roughly $800 billion have been spent by the
            United States for security. Perhaps half of this can be attributed to the unsolved
            German question. The Soviets have been forced to make similar military efforts yet they
            are unwilling to concede that giving a free choice to 17 million East Germans might be
            in the interest of both the United States and the Soviet Union. Perhaps more is at
            stake. Maybe the Soviets believe that the future course of all of Eastern Europe is at
            stake. We should examine this thesis more closely.</p>
                    <p>Schroeder: We have the impression that Moscow does not prevent increased trade between
            Eastern Europe and the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> because it knows:</p>
                    <p>1. It is the desire of most of these countries to trade.</p>
                    <p>2. Development of Eastern Europe helps the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in
            turn. In any event, we know of no case where trade with the West goes much above
            20%.</p>
                    <p>We have no evidence that the Soviets have a real worry that any of the lands of Eastern
            Europe are about to leave their orbit, and I don't think this likely. Moscow's most
            unpleasant experience has been with Rumania, but that has not exceeded proportions that
            Moscow can accept.</p>
                    <p>I think we should consider carefully what our American colleague has said. Joint study
            of Moscow's relations with Eastern Europe might lead us to interesting conclusions.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: I want to make it quite clear that I was posing questions and not
            stating conclusions. I was expressing hypotheses which I think merit further
            investigation.</p>
                    <p>Schroeder: We seem to be agreed with the analysis of the problem. The question arises
            of what to do about it. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> feels that it is
            necessary to present the German case to world opinion: that the Germans have a legal and
            moral right to self-determination and a right to national unity. There is a need to
            repeat this over and over again. Otherwise the impression is given that the West has
            accepted the division of Germany as permanent. <pb n="339" xml:id="pg_339" facs="0369"/>For this reason we would like the communiqué of this <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting to include the usual remarks on the German question.</p>
                    <p>We are aware that Germany should do what it can to make reunification attractive to
            Eastern European countries. We are prepared to make sacrifices in connection with
            reunification which relate to three general areas:</p>
                    <p>1. The Eastern borders,</p>
                    <p>2. The military status of a reunified Germany, and</p>
                    <p>3. Economic and financial contributions.</p>
                    <p>But the Federal Republic will make these concessions only in connection with
            reunification and never without it. In this regard we ask the three Western powers to
            help us in countering Soviet propaganda charges of militarism and revanchism.</p>
                    <p>The Church Documents of a recent date include the Evangelical Church memorandum and the
            statements by the Polish and German Catholic Bishops<note n="10" xml:id="d134fn10">For
              texts, see Europa Archiv, 1966, vol. 2, pp. 1–19.</note> which have had a strong
            public impact. We think that these documents are of great importance but are not in the
            first line of political importance.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and Eastern Europe we will
            continue to improve our economic relations. We think that there also exist good chances
            for improvement in such things as exchange of students and professors, and in the
            tourist area.</p>
                    <p>However, the most difficult question for us is how to behave with respect to the East
            German regime. Somehow, after restudy, we always seem to come back to our original
            conclusions. We must reject that regime and we must point out that the USSR and its
            armed forces prop up that regime. We feel that this policy is correct. We ask your
            support of it. It is not merely a question of recognition or non-recognition, but a
            problem of countering the upgrading of that regime. Trade plays a role here and we ask
            that trade not receive state support. Also we must stick to the four-power principle. We
            fear that our policy will fail if the Soviets succeed in shifting us from this principle
            which has been supported by the three powers (together with the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>).</p>
                    <p>Further, we must consider what steps can be taken to forestall possible Soviet moves
            against Berlin. It is a comfort to know that the Berlin question was not raised by the
            Soviets during the recent visits. But the possible introduction of passes and visas by
            Zone authorities remains a perplexing possibility which might easily become too hot to
            handle. It has been discussed in the four-power group, but I think that there still is
            some disagreement. We would like to bring this matter to a conclusion soon.</p>

                    <p>The Secretary: It seems to me Minister Schroeder has made some extremely interesting
            remarks this evening. It seems to me that disarmament, normalization of trade, and such
            questions are of interest all over Europe. The communications among the Church Leaders
            also seems to be of some significance. Do you plan to mention them in your speech? [Dr.

                    </p>
                    <p>Schroeder: Yes, I would like to mention the Church Documents, but not in detail.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName>: I too think it would be good to say
            something about the Church Documents and I agree with you (the Secretary) that we should

                        <persName corresp="#p_GBSPH1">Gore-Booth</persName>: I prefer saying that we discussed
            problems related to Germany rather than the “German problem” because the latter implies

                    <p>The Secretary: As far as we are concerned, we also spoke of the problem of
            reunification.</p>
                    <p>The four parties agreed that press communiqués could say that the Quadripartite Group

            your preparation for talks with <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> I should
            report a conversation with Schroeder on further German help for Viet-Nam.<note n="2" xml:id="d135fn2">See also <ref target="#d136">Document 136</ref>.</note> I pointed out
            to him that the full revelation to the Congress of the extent of our requirements in
            Viet-Nam will raise major questions about what others are doing in the face of our own
            continuing commitments in such areas as <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. I told
            him it was of the utmost importance that Germany find a way to send considerable numbers
            of people to South Viet-Nam. I mentioned specifically engineers of all types, medical
            personnel, private contractors to undertake building programs, police personnel, etc.
            Schroeder's reaction was very negative. He mentioned that they were the second largest
            contributor to Viet-Nam economically but said that they had not been successful in
            getting volunteers to go to perform services. He had talked with a number of
            organizations with little result. He commented that people in Germany are under the
            impression that all of South Viet-Nam is a war zone. I told him this was in effect true
            and that it was a dangerous place and that was a major reason why free countries ought
            to take a hand in it.</p>
                    <p>When he discounted the possibility of private citizens I raised the question of
            military or police units to perform similar services. He seemed to think they had legal
            as well as policy obstacles to any such answer.</p>
                    <p>I report this because I was very disappointed with his general attitude. It seems to me
            that we should marshal a strong case for <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>
            and put to him some very specific suggestions as to units or type personnel that we
            strongly want from the Federal Republic. I would advise against combat units as such but
            it is important that we get some Germans into the field.</p>

                    <p>Secretary met with Schroeder at 12:30 <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> December 15 and
            reported he had just discussed communiqué problem with <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName>, informing him that we could not agree to place specific time
            limitation on special committee. Secretary said he had suggested to <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> that communiqué omit any reference to timing.
            Schroeder agreed this would be satisfactory.<note n="2" xml:id="d136fn2">For a summary
              of discussions at this December 15 meeting, see <ref target="frus1964-68v13#d118">

                    </p>
                    <p>Secretary said that while President and <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>
            spoke alone together during forthcoming Washington meeting he hoped that he and
            Schroe-der could pursue question of possible declaration on Germany following up on
            Schroeder's comments at Quadripartite dinner. Secretary had impression that there were
            some things which could be said about political settlement in Europe which, while they
            might not have an effect in Moscow, could have impact in Eastern Europe. We could spell
            out some of prospects which would open up if Germany were reunified in freedom, i.e.
            boundary settlement, arms control, trade and economic assistance. What might be
            considered is unilateral Western declaration outlining these prospects.</p>
                    <p>Schroeder seemed relatively cool to this idea noting <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> had already given direct indications of these possibilities on various
            occasions. He agreed however on need for more emphasis on advantages reunification would
            bring to the East. In absence prospect serious negotiations, however, it was difficult
            and dangerous to get into details. Secretary recalled that Schroeder had talked of
            formalizing “arms status” of <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and wondered if this
            referred to control over arms levels or covered such matters as German membership in
              <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. Schroeder replied this formula went back many
            years and was intentionally vague. No real discussion on European security system
            possible in abstract. Secretary suggested this matter be pursued further in
            Washington.</p>
                    <p>Secretary asked whether there were any special developments in <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>-Polish relations. Schroeder said there were no developments of positive
            nature. Poles have held <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> trade mission to exclusively
            trade problems. There has been no trace of Polish desire to use <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> mission as <pb n="343" xml:id="pg_343" facs="0373"/>point of departure
            for political discussions. Polish Bishops' overture to German Bishops has been squelched
            by political authorities although it was still not clear whether Poles would actually
            attempt to prevent their entry.</p>
                    <p>Secretary said President would wish to discuss Vietnam with Chancellor. In early
            January he would have to go to Congress with more specific recommendations re future US
            commitments in <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>. These would include substantially
            larger number of men and large increase in US defense budget, and would inevitably
            stimulate discussion of US commitments in Europe. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> had tried to fend off consequences this questioning by stating
            our intention not to make major changes in US combat forces in Europe. However questions
            would arise as to what our Allies are doing to help in <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>. It would be helpful if <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> could
            consider this issue and specifically whether it could send engineers, medical, or other
            specialized personnel. He recognized problems this would raise but wished to flag it as
            subject for discussion with Chancellor.</p>
                    <p>Schroeder noted in reply that <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> economic aid was
            second only to US and that personnel represented major difficulty. This could only be
            done on voluntary basis and matter had been raised with many private organizations.
            Response so far was not encouraging. Secretary asked whether “official units” such as
            police, hospital or engineering units could be sent. Schroeder said that he would have
            this matter looked into in detail.<note n="3" xml:id="d136fn3">Regarding this discussion
              of Vietnam, see also <ref target="#d135">Document 135</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Discussion concluded with review of status negotiations on communiqué with US promise
            to support sentence rebutting Soviet anti-<gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> defamation
            campaign and promise by Secretary to speak to Danes,<note n="4" xml:id="d136fn4">A
              handwritten notation reads: “Not French?”</note> who constituted major resistance to
            inclusion of this thought. Secretary made clear his personal disenchantment with entire
            process of communiqué drafting and disinclination to devote many minutes of Ministerial
            time to it. Schroeder noted that communiqués have some importance for European public
            opinion and for historical record.</p>

                    <p>Dear Ron:</p>
                    <p>I have been struck by the continued discussions of the unification question in private
            at high levels within the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> community. It seems to
            me that we may not be able to keep this issue in a low key much longer. We may face a
            choice between a US initiative or a German initiative. I, and I think the Germans, would
            prefer a US initiative with widespread European support to a German initiative. I would
            suggest that we consider a statement of principles on Europe similar to those of
              <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName>/Zorin on disarmament.<note n="2" xml:id="d137fn2">Reference is to the joint statement of agreed principles for
              disarmament negotiations, adopted by the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General
              Assembly on September 20, 1961. For text, see <hi rend="italic">American Foreign
                Policy: Current Documents, 1961</hi>, pp. 1091–1094.</note> Attached are my thoughts
            on such a statement of principles. I realize these are somewhat different than the 1961
            statement of principles on Europe<note n="3" xml:id="d137fn3">For text, see ibid., pp.
              470–472.</note> but the situation has changed and a statement which reflects the need
            and a solution which is acceptable to both Eastern and Western Europe is necessary if we
            are to maintain the support of those on the Continent who believe, whether mistakenly or
            not, that the Soviet Union might agree to an evolutionary program. Clearly thoughts of
            early unification are illusory.</p>
                    <p>If there is merit in such an approach, it should be discussed with the Germans and our
              <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies before any discussions with the
            Russians.</p>
                    <p>I hope the above is useful.</p>
                    <p>Sincerely,</p>

                    <p rend="center">STATEMENT OF AGREED PRINCIPLES (FOR DISCUSSION WITH THE GERMAN, FRENCH,
            AND BRITISH GOVERNMENTS)</p>
                    <p>1. The nations of Europe agree that armed force should not be used to change the
            political and social systems, or geographical boundaries of <pb n="345" xml:id="pg_345" facs="0375"/>any nation in Europe, and that peaceful negotiations should be utilized
            to resolve problems between nations.</p>
                    <p>2. Progress toward a lasting peace in Europe should proceed by stages, with provisions
            for a stage-by-stage review to insure fulfillment of past obligations prior to
            initiation of new ones.</p>
                    <p>3. Each stage in the process should be balanced in such a way that no state or group of
            states will gain a military advantage through its implementation, thus insuring equally
            the security of all concerned.</p>
                    <p>4. The future of Europe should rest upon the right of all its people to
            self-determination.</p>
                    <p>5. The Four Powers would retain their special responsibilities in Germany until a
            European peace treaty is signed.</p>
                    <p>6. In the interests of a lasting peace and an effective system of European security,
            the Four Powers would consult with all European states in the process of developing a
            program for peace in Europe.</p>

                    <p>The Chancellor said that what the US is doing in Viet-Nam and other parts of the world
            in turmoil affects the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> as well. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> has given the US moral support and also material help,
            although its help has been small in comparison with the US effort. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> will also give consideration to what more it can do.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he would call on Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> to comment but first he would like to make a brief remark about
            the political atmosphere in the US during the next few weeks. Our friends around the
            world pay us the supreme compliment of never worrying about the morale of the American
            people. The US has suffered over 160,000 casualties in combat since the end of World War
            II. We have spent $800 billion in defense budgets since 1947.</p>
                    <p>In January the President will present to Congress the dimensions of our requirements
            for Viet-Nam in terms of manpower and money. This will lead to questions as to what
            others are doing in view of the scale of the US effort. The President will have to defer
            many domestic requirements, including those involved in the Great Society, because of
            our relations with the rest of the world.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> briefly described the scope
            of the US efforts in Viet-Nam. The US now has about 185,000 personnel there and this
            will be increased by the end of the year to about 200,000. These numbers will rise
            continuously next year. Viet-Nam is costing about $10 billion a year and this figure
            will probably rise. These are matters the President will be discussing in January.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that US defense
            spending is much higher than that of any other nation in the Free World. The increased
            effort in Viet-Nam would have an effect on the US internal economic situation. The US
            has proportionately twice as many men in uniform as the nations of Western Europe.
            Questions will be asked at home regarding this heavy burden in men, money and blood.</p>

            knew quite well that the US had an unwavering commitment to defend Europe. We
            nevertheless do have to honor our commitment in Viet-Nam. We had not, however, worked
            out how we were going to do that. If we withdraw, we would be breaking a commitment and
            our word would no longer be any good. We cannot accept a defeat.</p>
                    <p>The Viet-Nam conflict is beginning to put a strain on our budget which will have to
            expand to accommodate the necessary expenditures.</p>
                    <p>All of this does not help us in our effort to cure our balance of payments.</p>

                    <p>The Chancellor explained that after the election he was forced to pare his budget by
            10%. He had to resort to such extreme measures as the repeal of some laws already on the
            books. This was not to say that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> did not want to
            keep its commitments. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> would be willing to talk

            AFTER THE WHITE HOUSE DINNER, 20 DECEMBER 1965</p>
                    <p>The President asked the Chancellor for:</p>
                    <p>1. Instructions to his Finance and Defense Ministers to meet fully the terms of the
            Offset Agreement.</p>
                    <p>2. The deployment of a German medical company and construction battalion to South
            Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>The President went on to say “we favored the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>'s
            proposal for a nuclear force<note n="2" xml:id="d141fn2">Memoranda of conversation

              and <ref target="frus1964-68v13#d120">120</ref>.</note> and would so state to the UK.”
              <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> replied:</p>
                    <p>1. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> will stand by the Offset Agreement but needs
            to discuss the terms and methods by which to accomplish this. He is not prepared to say
            that at such and such a date they would pay such and such an amount.</p>
                    <p>2. He is thinking of the possibility of sending medical personnel to South Vietnam
            through the Red Cross. He is not certain whether it would be possible under their
            existing legislation to send military units to Vietnam. “Perhaps it could be done on a
            voluntary basis—it can perhaps be undertaken—I think something can be done.”</p>
                    <p>3. He would not object to a reference in the communiqué<note n="3" xml:id="d141fn3">For

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> opened by asking whether there
            were any points the Chancellor wished particularly to discuss.</p>
                    <p>Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> asked about US views on the
              <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> Round. He said the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> was working for the full success of the <gloss target="#t_KR1">KR</gloss> and felt that there would be a great loss in cooperation
            between North America and Europe if the <gloss target="#t_KR1">KR</gloss> failed.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> said he was delighted to hear
            this. Since May 1963 there had not been much progress at Geneva and things were now
            completely stalled. Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> said that he
            did not see that the United States could do anything to disentangle the Common Market
            impasse and that, although there was talk of various possible alternatives to the <gloss target="#t_KR1">KR</gloss>, he could not see that they were equally viable. The United
            States hopes for a resolution of the current difficulties so that we can all move
            ahead.</p>
                    <pb n="351" xml:id="pg_351" facs="0381"/>
                    <p>Regarding the timetable, Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> said
            that we have a year and a half ahead of us. Substantial or complete agreement on the
              <gloss target="#t_KR1">KR</gloss> must be obtained four or five months before this
            time elapses. Therefore by mid-March 1966 at the latest, the resolution of the Common
            Market nations to move ahead must be in evidence. Regular meetings must be under way by
            May 1966.</p>
                    <p>To get moving, Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> said that it
            would be necessary for the Six to reach a commitment for the successful conclusion of
            the <gloss target="#t_KR1">KR</gloss> and especially that a flexible mandate should be
            given to the Common Market negotiators rather than faits accomplis. The US has made its
            position clear and reciprocal agreements on both sides are needed. Furthermore, progress
            must be made regarding agriculture, either by direct negotiations or by international
            agreements. On agriculture we recognize that the Common Market has an internal
            problem.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> said that the Trade Expansion
            Act (<gloss target="#t_TEA1">TEA</gloss>) expires in June 1967 but an agreement on the
              <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> Round must be signed before that time
            since a number of matters will have to be worked out before the Act expires. The
            Governor noted that protectionist forces may grow in strength.</p>
                    <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said he wished to emphasize
            that there would be enormous difficulties in obtaining any extension of time from
            Congress, even though we might be well down the road to agreement when the <gloss target="#t_TEA1">TEA</gloss> expires. Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that the Congress would very carefully examine the results of
            the <gloss target="#t_KR1">KR</gloss> negotiations.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> described the political background
            of President <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName>'s decision to ask Congress
            for the <gloss target="#t_TEA1">TEA</gloss>. The Secretary said that President <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> had decided to press for far-reaching legislative
            authority to expand trade rather than asking for a one or two-year extension of the
            Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act. President <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> had also asked Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> to take charge of the program.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary noted that the spirit of Atlantic partnership had been strong at the time
            President <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> made this decision. Strong
            support for the <gloss target="#t_TEA1">TEA</gloss> had been obtained. If we are still
            having major problems by June 1967, the idea of trade expansion will be in very serious
            straits. The United States therefore appreciates the efforts of Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> and the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> to
            move ahead.</p>
                    <p>Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> said that he was fully aware
            of the great economic and political significance of the <gloss target="#t_KR1">KR</gloss>, noting that he had personally been involved when he was Economics
            Minister. The Chancellor said that the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> has a mandate
            to continue negotiations on industrial items but that a Common Market decision is needed
            on agriculture. The Chancellor said that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> would
            be encouraged to take up new initiatives as a result of his visit to Washington.</p>
                    <pb n="352" xml:id="pg_352" facs="0382"/>
                    <p>The Chancellor noted that French views on agriculture are different from those of the
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> is the
            largest importer of agricultural products in the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>.
            The other members are not so interested in agricultural imports. The Chancellor stressed
            the economic and political importance of the <gloss target="#t_KR1">KR</gloss> and the
            significance he attached to it.</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister Schroeder said that the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> problem is
            linked directly to the present state of relations among the Six. He thought that it
            might be possible in January to get the French back to the negotiating table by a
            roundabout way—in Luxembourg. He noted that there are extremely difficult questions
            involved requiring major decisions.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister said that a further mandate must be given on the basis of
            unanimity for <gloss target="#t_KR1">KR</gloss> negotiations. This will not be easy to
            obtain but the Foreign Minister was not pessimistic. He thought that problems with
            France would come to some resolution and that a mandate would be given. The Foreign
            Minister said the problem is up to the Six but he thought the US could give useful
            encouragement as regards speeding up the <gloss target="#t_KR1">KR</gloss>.</p>

                    <p>The President asked Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> if he
            was happy with the communiqué as just agreed upon.<note n="2" xml:id="d143fn2">For text,
              see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, January 10, 1966, pp.
              50–51.</note> The Chancellor replied he was happy <pb n="353" xml:id="pg_353" facs="0383"/>and thought it had been a good idea to include the passage on the Great
            Society and the Formierte Gesellschaft. He thanked the President for agreeing to the
            last minute changes suggested by his representatives and expressed his gratitude for the
            wonderful reception he and his staff had received, in particular the splendid dinner the
            night before.</p>
                    <p>The President remarked that he had read carefully the paper on nuclear sharing that the
            Chancellor had submitted<note n="3" xml:id="d143fn3">See <ref target="frus1964-68v13#d119fn3">
                                <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1964–1968, vol. XIII, Document 119,
                footnote 3</ref>.</note> and that he was in basic agreement with the ideas contained
            therein. He would talk to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> about
              it.<note n="4" xml:id="d143fn4">For text of President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s December 23 letter to <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName>, see ibid., <ref target="#d121">Document 121</ref>.</note>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> should also mention this issue to
              <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> separately. After that they could look
            at it again in more detail. They should keep in close touch on the matter.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor agreed to discuss the matter with Prime Minister Wilson and did not
            pursue the subject further.</p>
                    <p>The President again brought up the matter of offset payments. He pressed the Chancellor
            hard for a German payment of $100 million before the first of the year reiterating that
            only $50 million had been received from Germany since July while up to $300 million had
            flowed from the U.S. to Germany during the same period. The President said the payment
            was needed because of the balance of payments situation and in order to retain
            confidence in the dollar.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor replied the Germans were honoring their agreements. The military were in
            the process of inventory and were not in a position to know what to order at this time.
            He did not think the President should look at this issue like an accountant from a
            short-term viewpoint, rather it should be looked at from a broader perspective. He again
            explained his own financial problems and said he would talk to his Finance Minister and
            the military to see what could be done. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HKU1">Von
              Hassel</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> were also
            discussing this and the matter was not being neglected.</p>
                    <p>The President said he was aware of the Chancellor's problems. He asked the Chancellor
            if he understood correctly that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> would honor the
            (offset) agreement. The Chancellor nodded agreement.</p>
                    <p>The President brought forth a letter from Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> in which the latter confirmed a higher British contribution to the
            Asian Development Bank.<note n="5" xml:id="d143fn5">A copy of <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName>'s December 17 letter is in the Johnson Library,
              National Security File, Head of State Correspondence, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, vol. 2.</note> He inquired if it was correct that the Federal Republic
            would contribute $50 million to the Bank.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor answered that he had been able to get only $30 million from his
            parliament at this time, but he repeated his private promise to the President to have
            this increased to $50 million at an opportune <pb n="354" xml:id="pg_354" facs="0384"/>time. Right now he could not do more. The President asked if this was $50 million
            total over 10 years. The Chancellor verified this.</p>
                    <p>The President explained again his tremendous budget problems. He might have to ask for
            as much as $125 billion to keep the effort in Viet-Nam and the other programs going. He
            reiterated his request for 200 medical personnel and a construction battalion of about a
            thousand men as a German contribution to Viet-Nam.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor repeated his remarks of the day before on this subject. He had no
            constitutional power to do this on his own. It would have to be done on a voluntary
            basis. He could therefore not make a firm promise, but he would throw his influence
            behind the matter and study it after his return. He would find some way of
            assisting.</p>
                    <p>The President asked the Chancellor what he could do for him, what he would like to take
            home with him for his people? The Chancellor replied he would like to repeat his
            invitation to have the President come to Germany for a visit in 1966. The President
            replied he was pleased by the invitation, but that he would be a very busy man in 1966
            and did not know if he would be able to come.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor asked the President what exactly he could tell his people and the press
            on this subject. The President said the Chancellor could tell them he had invited him,
            that the President was delighted over the invitation, that he would very much like to
            go, that however at this time he could not definitely commit himself. Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> had expressed great interest in going to Germany
            in 1966. She would like to go with Interior Secretary <persName corresp="#p_USL1">Udall</persName> to study city planning and beautification programs in Germany.
            Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> replied that Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> would be most welcome in the Federal
            Republic.</p>

                    <p>Dr. Barzel said the Secretary must be aware of recent German efforts to get some
            movement on the German question, the question of reunification. He thought it was very
            important for the Germans to do something about this at this time where there is
            considerable dismay over the Franco-German relationship. He cited the German peace note
            of March 25, 1966,<note n="2" xml:id="d145fn2">For text, see <hi rend="italic">Documents
                on Germany, 1944–1985</hi>, pp. 914–918.</note> referred to the German proposals of
            February 1962 and September 1963,<note n="3" xml:id="d145fn3">For texts of the February
              21, 1962, German memorandum and the September 14, 1963, statement by Barzel, see
              Meissner, <hi rend="italic">Die deutsche Ostpolitik</hi>, pp. 28–33, 55–56.</note> and
            asked if they could not be dusted off for another try at resolving the German question.
            In this connection, he said he appreciated the advice we had given Parliament President
            Gerstenmaier regarding the holding of a Bundestag meeting in Berlin,<note n="4" xml:id="d145fn4">The U.S. position was conveyed in an April 7, 1965, message to the
              Soviet Union. For text, see <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current
                Documents, 1965</hi>, pp. 483–484.</note> but he thought it was important to
            reexamine this question. He said some little progress had been made in the matter of
            passes, prisoner releases, etc. More was needed.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary replied with three observations: (1) He would urge Dr. Barzel not to
            believe Viet-Nam diverted us from Europe. (2) We feel a policy of movement with respect
            to Eastern Europe has had a constructive influence and has reawakened in the states of
            Eastern Europe a nostalgic interest in Western Europe. (3) If we embark on a new
            approach to settle the German question we must be prepared to look down the long trail
            and make sure everybody will continue on it once we embark on it. He reminded Dr. Barzel
            that the problem of central Europe is virtually the only problem over which we and the
            Soviets could wage a nuclear <pb n="356" xml:id="pg_356" facs="0386"/>war. It
            represented a tremendous outlay for us in terms of money and effort, over 5 hundred
            billion dollars since 1947. It represented an equally great expense to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. In the main, we have carried the principal burden in
            the free world. France did not participate in the crisis of Berlin in 1961. The
            Secretary added he was not for giving away East Germany but he thought the time would
            come when what happens to 17 million Germans will not be the important question to a
            billion people that it is today. He said we were serious in resolving the question on
            the basis of what the 17 million East Germans wanted. It was futile and nerve-wracking,
            however, to stir up these questions without being able to solve them.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Barzel agreed that we must know in advance the steps which will be taken. He felt
            however the dynamics of the situation required some new attention. He thought the German
            peace note had been useful. He said if the Soviet Union asked what the reunified Germany
            will look like, we must be able to say what a reunified Germany will look like. On the
            other hand, the agreements of 1945 to settle the final borders of Germany were a promise
            both to the Allies as well as to the Germans. The problem was to get around the table
            and then we can come to terms on the frontiers.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary thought the question of the Soviet Zone may be more difficult for the
            Russians because of their fears that by losing it they would surrender all of Eastern
            Europe. He reiterated his principal point that we were prepared to work seriously with
            our Allies on the German question. We are most anxious to rid ourselves of this most
            dangerous and expensive question. He reminded Dr. Barzel that when he saw <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, the latter warned him that even though the
            German situation appeared to be quiet, the German question remained for the Soviets also
            the most important outstanding unresolved question.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Barzel thanked the Secretary for his candid views.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked Dr. Barzel to convey his kindest regards to Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> and Foreign Minister Schroeder. In parting, he
            emphasized again that the Germans must not exaggerate Viet-Nam and decide that it is the
            only thing we are talking or thinking about. We will keep our eyes on Europe.</p>

            Ambassador to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>

                    </p>
                    <p>1. Spangenberg has given us the following account of Brandt's conversation with
              <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> at noon on May 8 in the home of
            Swedish Consul General Backlund. He spoke from a memorandum of conversation drafted by
            the Governing Mayor before his departure for Bonn. The discussion lasted two and a half
            hours.</p>
                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> opened the conversation by asking
            Brandt about the Congress in Stockholm Brandt had just attended, and subsequently
            discussed the 23rd Congress of the Communist Party in the Soviet Union which, he said,
            had mainly considered internal problems and was “unsensational.” <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> then contrasted the German and Soviet quests
            for peace. He described German policy as “hostile,” especially as based upon the
            restoration of the 1937 borders. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> peace note, he
            said, does not serve the cause of peace. Brandt “energetically rebutted” this view and
            then brought up the subject of German unity.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> said there are two German states
            that must strive to understand each other even though differences in their social
            systems make the degree of understanding necessarily limited. Brandt replied that there
            are not only differences in social systems but there are also differing <pb n="358" xml:id="pg_358" facs="0388"/>views among the Great Powers (i.e., the West and the
            Soviets) on the question of German unity.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> argued that it must be possible
            nonetheless for both Germanys to agree upon certain practical questions. He mentioned in
            this connection the prospects for an exchange of speakers between the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_SED1">SED</gloss>, although he did
            not discuss this subject in detail. <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName>
            stressed “very pointedly” that the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> is not a Soviet
            state. He said of himself that he could not dictate policy in East Germany. If he had
            attempted to do this, his removal would have been sought a long time ago.</p>
                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> described <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>/Soviet relations as unsatisfactory and said that in the field of trade
            the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> must either improve its relations with the
            Soviets or find other trade partners to fill the gap now filled by the Soviets. At the
            party level, <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> said that relations
            between the Soviets and the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> are poor; Soviet
            relations with Socialist parties in other countries are far better. He regretted that
            the Communist Party is outlawed in the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>6. Berlin was the theme of the final portion of this discussion. <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> objected to the presence of Bundestag
            representatives and other <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> officials in West Berlin.
            He thanked Brandt warmly for the latter's remarks in recent biweekly broadcast about the
            valor of the two Soviet pilots who lost their lives in the Stossensee plane crash.
            Brandt seized this opportunity to complain about the sonic booms caused by Soviet jets.
              <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> said these flights would be kept to a
            minimum.</p>
                    <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> deplored the poor state of
            relations between West Berlin and the Soviet Union in the field of trade. Without
            mentioning Starchinov by name, he asked why it has not been possible for the Soviets to
            open a small trade office in West Berlin. This office, he said, would deal not only with
            West Berlin firms but also with firms in the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. Brandt
            made no direct reply. He discussed the common ground on which the German currency and
            economic system is based as between West Berlin and the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, emphasizing that Berlin itself is not an area narrowly controlled in
            this respect by the protective powers. Brandt said that he would reflect upon how
            Berlin's portion of the whole of <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>/Soviet trade might
            be increased in the future.</p>
                    <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> said there should be more cultural
            exchanges between Berlin and the Soviet Union, suggesting that there be scheduled every
            three months a major Soviet cultural event in Berlin. He quoted each of the Allied
            Ambassadors as having told him that they had no objection in principle to this. Brandt
            asked whether it was not easier to increase such exchanges in a setting that is not
            government-to-government, to which <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName>
            agreed, saying these matters are more easily arranged through private agencies. He
            suggested that in cultural and sport exchanges, a city-to-city arrangement, such as
            Moscow to Berlin, <pb n="359" xml:id="pg_359" facs="0389"/>would be desirable. Brandt
            said he would discuss these thoughts with those in Berlin responsible for such
            matters.</p>
                    <p>9. At the close of the conversation, <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName>
            asked whether a meeting such as this could be held again under the same circumstances.
            Brandt said he could not answer the question, but volunteered the statement that he
            could not accept an invitation from <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> to
            come to East Berlin. Brandt then made it clear that he was talking to <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> in the latter's capacity as a representative of
            one of the Four Powers responsible for Berlin and not as the Soviet Ambassador to East
            Germany.</p>
                    <p>10. Asked about the atmosphere of the talks, Spangenberg said Brandt had been very
            pleased. <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName>, he felt, was not talking as a
            diplomat but as a party man. It was possible for both of them to talk openly and in
            tough terms. Jokes had been exchanged. While this was not an atmosphere of confidence,
            it was not cool either. The mood was that of two political opponents having a frank
            talk.</p>
                    <p>11. Spangenberg said both participants agreed that it would be desirable to keep their
            meeting confidential and out of the press. He said that on the Senat side, only Senator
            Schuetz aside from himself knew of these developments.</p>
                    <p>12. Comment: The meeting went about as expected. <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> sought to develop the anticipated themes and he endeavored to
            move toward a continuing contact with Brandt.</p>
                    <p>13. The account given us by Spangenberg leaves the impression of sparring and of
            feeling out mutual positions. It is hard to see how either Brandt or <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> can expect much from the contact unless it is
            pursued, either in the same or in some other channel. Brandt's equivocal reply to
              <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName>'s proposal for another meeting seems
            to suggest he would not be averse to continuing the contact himself.</p>
                    <p>14. It would appear that the next move is up to Brandt, either to approach the Allies
            regarding a further meeting or to let the matter rest. Spangenberg stated Brandt would
            elaborate on his personal reactions in a direct talk with the Allies.<note n="3" xml:id="d147fn3">The Mission reported Brandt's impressions of the talks in telegram

            for us.</p>

                        <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_SED1">SED</gloss> Debates</p>
                    <p>Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SM12">Stewart</persName> as host opened the
            meeting by asking Foreign Minister Schroeder about the forthcoming debates in Germany
            between the West German Socialists (<gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss>) and East German
            Communists (<gloss target="#t_SED1">SED</gloss>).</p>
                    <p>Schroeder said there would be two debates—on July 14 in Chemnitz and on July 21 in
            Hanover. There will be full press-radio-T.V. coverage. The safety of the participants
            will be guaranteed. The idea for the debates was initiated by the <gloss target="#t_SED1">SED</gloss> in February, obviously in an effort to win over the
              <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> and split it from the other West German
            parties.</p>
                    <p>Schroeder said that the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> has no desire to establish
            common ground with the East German Communists. The hope of the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> is to bring about greater freedom in the Soviet zone, to promote more
            exchanges of people, and possibly to win relaxing of the Communist order to shoot people
            at the Berlin Wall. The goal of the <gloss target="#t_SED1">SED</gloss> is to increase
            its prestige and promote the idea of two Germanys.</p>
                    <p>Schroeder thought that the debates would stir great interest in East Germany. He
            thought the humanitarian aspects are particularly important, as they have been in the
            case of the Berlin passes agreement. Schroe-der was therefore inclined on balance to see
            positive aspects.</p>
                    <pb n="361" xml:id="pg_361" facs="0391"/>
                    <p>In summary, Schroeder thought there were three main aspects: the moral and
            psychological effect in East Germany; the advantage to West Germany in maintaining
            contacts with East Germany; and the international effect in obtaining political support
            for the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister said that the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>, the ruling
            party in the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, had first doubted the advantage of
            these debates, but the government had given support from the outset, feeling that the
            socialists should receive its support.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> asked whether there would be only
            two debates or would they be continued. Schroeder said that it is his impression they
            should be restricted to two meetings. He doubted that the exchange should be continued
            indefinitely or that useful results would be obtained from continuation.</p>
                    <p>Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SM12">Stewart</persName> thought that people
            outside of Germany would believe the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> is taking
            advantage of an opportunity in these debates. He asked what other opportunities
            Schroeder saw at this time. Schroeder said that there would be some negative aspects to
            these debates, which would result in a certain upgrading of the East German Communists.
            He noted that there had apparently been close contact between the East German Communists
            and Polish Communists; he thought therefore there might be a certain side-advantage in
            Eastern Europe resulting from these debates. There might also be a lessening of rigidity
            in East Germany.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said that these debates would be
            watched with great interest and that their potential effect might be considerable.
              <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> thought the debates would have a useful
            impact in the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and in the so-called <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. There might also be a connection, he thought, with
            developments in Poland.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Eastern Europe</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> asked Couve about his recent
            visits to Eastern Europe.<note n="3" xml:id="d148fn3">
                            <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> visited Romania and Bulgaria April 25–30
              and Poland May 18–21.</note>
                        <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> said he had not got the impression of
            anything very new. The situation differs in the various countries he had visited—Poland,
            Rumania, and Bulgaria. He said there is little in common between these three countries.
            The Rumanians are not Slavs and do not particularly like the Russians; they have
            territorial problems with the Russians. Bulgaria is in a different position; it gets
            along well with the Russians and does not like Greece and Turkey, with whom it has a
            common border. Poland relies on the Soviet Union, as it must because of its geographical
            position.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> said that changes are currently taking
            place in all of these countries by contrast with the situation 10 to 15 years ago. They
            are more <pb n="362" xml:id="pg_362" facs="0392"/>relaxed politically. They are better
            off economically except for Poland, which has an agricultural problem.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> thought there was a drive in all of these
            countries to improve their relations with other countries. He thought that Poland in
            particular wanted to improve its relations with the U.S.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said he believed there is a
            sentiment in Eastern Europe for closer relations with the nations of Western Europe. He
            noted that minority groups in the United States also have a keen interest in Eastern
            Europe, particularly the Polish and Serbo-Croatian minorities.</p>

              1.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SM12">Stewart</persName> asked <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> about his next journey. <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> replied that he would accompany President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> to Russia for ten days, where they would visit
            Moscow and a number of cities including what is presently called Volgagrad. <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> said that as he had previously indicated to Foreign
            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SM12">Stewart</persName> and as he would say at the
              <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Ministerial Meeting, this visit is a stage in
            the French policy of developing more relations with the East in all fields. <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> said he was sure that nothing dramatic would happen
            on this trip. The French would expect to discuss the German question as well as other
            questions with the Soviets. The French would stress the need to develop relations
            between Eastern and Western Europe, thus creating a climate of détente. <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> did not think that an atmosphere of understanding
            could be created at this stage with the Soviets. The French would expect to discuss
            various problems and possible solutions that might eventually be reached.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> asked whether the Soviet Union had
            said anything about the topics it would like to discuss. <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> said the Soviets had given no particular indication of this. He
            added that France would probably sign a consular agreement and possibly a space
            agreement with the Soviets. In response to the Secretary's question as to whether France
            would sign a communications satellite agreement with the Soviets, <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> said he did not think things would go this far.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">European Security and Tension Between East and West</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SM12">Stewart</persName> said that he thought it was good to make
            large and small scale approaches at these various questions outstanding between East and
            West but he wondered whether this approach got us any nearer to solving what the Soviets
            call the European security question.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> said this is a real question. If however we
            desire settlements by peaceful means, then we must seek a climate for discussions where
            the understanding of the Soviet Government can become possible.</p>
                    <pb n="363" xml:id="pg_363" facs="0393"/>
                    <p>Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SM12">Stewart</persName> agreed and said that it
            is more difficult for the Germans in this area than for the rest of us. <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> agreed that the problem of Germany is the real
            problem.</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister Schroeder said the problem which confronts us is to determine in whose
            favor these various approaches to the East work. Each side seeks its own advantage. The
            Communists seek to consolidate the status quo. The question therefore is whether these
            approaches help to overcome the division of Germany and Europe or do they perpetuate the
            division of Germany and the status quo. This is the reason why the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> is reserved on the question of Europe security.</p>
                    <p>Schroeder continued that it would be bad if the European security situation were abused
            to prevent solution of various outstanding problems. It would be useful if security
            considerations could progress in such a way as to help these other matters. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> feels that in public discussions of the security issue,
            it must be careful because of these various factors. He noted that the Soviets have put
            forth security proposals again and again since 1955 but not for the purpose of
            overcoming the division of Europe. The question now is whether a new beginning can
            usefully be undertaken or whether the same old controversies will continue.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> indicated that he did not think the Soviet
            suggestion for a European security conference<note n="5" xml:id="d148fn5">For text of
              the May 17 Soviet proposal, see <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current
                Documents, 1966</hi>, pp. 395–402.</note> was a serious proposal at this time. He
            said that a cautious development of relations could be useful and could lead to progress
            toward ending the division of Europe. France believes that ending the division of Europe
            is the only way to end the division of Germany. <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> then asked whether there is any alternative to this method. Foreign
            Minister Schroeder said that we are all agreed that we should try to have good relations
            with Eastern Europe and that this is useful. He said that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> has, despite its particular difficulties, established trade missions in
            Eastern Europe. He noted that the Rumanian Trade Minister had recently visited Bonn and
            been introduced to the Bundestag. <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> said that
            the French had not gone this far with a Communist Minister.</p>
                    <p>Schroeder went on to say that the crucial question is to keep alive in Eastern Europe
            and the Soviet Union an interest in overcoming the division of Germany under suitable
            conditions. We do not want to arouse Communist hopes that tension will be removed
            without any effort on their part; then they would have no incentive. The difficulty is
            to work for good relations on the one hand but nevertheless to show the Communists that
            they have an interest in improving the status quo. Schroeder emphasized that the main
            problem is the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <pb n="364" xml:id="pg_364" facs="0394"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> said he would like to make several points.
            First, tension has been characteristic of the past 20 years but France does not believe
            this is the way to bring about solutions. Second, we must be cautious and should not be
            led to believe that things can develop very fast even if we hope for rapid change.
            Third, developments now in progress mean that things will not stay where they are. We do
            not know where all this will bring us in relation to Germany. We do not know, for
            example, what will happen after the debates in Germany. Perhaps there will be a
            deadlock.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said that perhaps there are two
            elements of faith on which we can rely. First, in free competition between institutions
            our free institutions have nothing to fear. Our tendency should be to break down
            barriers. Second, the 17 million people in Eastern Germany will want to be associated
            with other Germans and under free institutions. The Secretary said he agreed that the
            existence of tension has not advanced German reunification.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary commented that although there is a formal appearance of status quo, the
            real situation can be changing rapidly. Changes are going on in Eastern Europe—in
            attitudes toward Germany, toward the economic institutions of Western Europe, and toward
            the institutions of the Communist countries themselves. The Secretary said that, for one
            example, he found it hard to believe that the Soviets could again resort to repression
            by armed force as they had done in Hungary. The Secretary added that no one is prepared
            to use force to change the situation. He said that tension has not helped German
            reunification and that we should give other things a chance. The Secretary cautioned
            that he was not talking about immediate changes or progress but at the same time he did
            not feel that we had to think in terms of decades.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that he was not always sure what was meant by “division of Europe”
            although he clearly understood the division of Germany. Schroeder said that in effect
            they are the same thing since Germany is in the middle of Europe. He said he doubted the
            validity of the argument that tension has not helped. In the past conditions have not
            been such as to bring about changes; problems between West and East Europe have been
            very difficult. Nor will basic problems be solved simply by creating better relations
            between Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and the rest.</p>
                    <p>The decisive fact, according to Foreign Minister Schroeder, is that Soviet divisions
            are on the Elbe. It may not be pleasant for the Soviets to keep them there, nor is it
            pleasant for the West to have to maintain its defensive military efforts.</p>
                    <p>Schroeder said that Soviet interests will change and the Soviets may become interested
            in other arrangements acceptable to all concerned. He commented that the Soviets remain
            disturbed about the problem of Communist China. The Soviets have troubles in Europe and
            elsewhere. <pb n="365" xml:id="pg_365" facs="0395"/>Schroeder felt that these problems
            had to be borne in mind when we talk about reducing tension.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary recalled Soviet threats over Berlin in 1961 and the Cuban missile crisis
            in 1962. He said there had been no Soviet change of heart toward the West. Tension had
            been created by the other side. The Secretary commented that there are those who say
            that if the Vietnam effort were abandoned, there would be better relations between the
            United States and the Soviet Union. We could do the same in Berlin; then we might have a
            temporary honeymoon with the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said that we pursue actions to our
            own advantage. He referred to the moon treaty now under discussion; this falls in the
            pattern of the Antarctica Treaty. The Secretary also commented on the attitude in
            Congress toward East/West trade.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> said that discussions with the other side
            do not imply accept-ance of their conditions. For agreement to be reached it must be
            acceptable to all concerned, and all have to make concessions.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary added he was sure the Soviets are concerned about the problem of nearly a
            billion Chinese along their Asian border. Schroeder said that <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> had been greatly concerned about this.
              <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> said the present Soviet leaders are also
            concerned.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">East German <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Application</p>
                    <p>Schroeder said that an application for <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> membership has
            been submitted in New York on behalf of East Germany and that we should give intensive
            thought to our strategy. Schroeder thought that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> might also introduce a proposal on European security to the <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> in its fall session.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> agreed that our representatives in
            New York should discuss this. The Secretary thought this did not present as much
            difficulty as the proposal for a world disarmament conference. He noted that the
            Communist Chinese had said they were not interested in taking part in a world
            disarmament conference, but a number of other Communist regimes might be involved
            including East Germany.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> said that East Germany may be aiming
            at observer status in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. The Secretary said that he
            did not think there was much interest in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in
            letting in East Germany.</p>
                    <p>The meeting ended at 11 p.m.</p>

                    <p>President Luebke opened by stating that in his judgment no great differences existed
            between Germany and the U.S. Germany had no issue to raise with respect to U.S. actions.
            He was, however, concerned about the offset payments. Was there some way this could be
            cut down? He had raised one question concerning the offset with Amb. <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> (i.e. on June 7 concerning the overall U.S.
            favorable trade balance with Germany which he had been told was $800–900,000,000 a year.
            Embtel 4040).<note n="2" xml:id="d149fn2">Telegram 4040 from Bonn, June 7, outlined
              discussions during the Ambassador's meeting with President Luebke. (Ibid.)</note> This
            had been answered the previous day in a letter from Ambassador<note n="3" xml:id="d149fn3">Not found.</note> showing a trade balance on the order of
            $200,000,000 in the U.S. favor.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said that he would be discussing
            the question of the offset later with the Chancellor. He did want the President to know,
            however, that our efforts in Viet-Nam had resulted in an important worsening of our
            balance of payments. It was for the general good that the stability of the dollar be
            maintained, and this required us to improve our balance of payments. President Luebke
            replied that Germany would continue to have “trade problems” which limit its overall
            foreign exchange earnings. Perhaps part of the offset could go to financing assist-ance
            to developing countries in which the U.S. has an interest. (Luebke is believed to have
            been confused on this point. His proposal would not protect Germany's balance since we
            would expect payment for any assistance rendered.) Otherwise Germany must earn an
            additional 7 billion <gloss target="#t_DM1">DM</gloss>
                        <pb n="367" xml:id="pg_367" facs="0397"/>a year. (It is assumed that Luebke was
            referring to the approximate <gloss target="#t_DM1">DM</gloss> 4.0 billion estimated as
            the German current account deficit, plus the <gloss target="#t_DM1">DM</gloss> 2.6
            billion offset, which would have to be compensated for by increased trade earnings if an
            overall balance is to be achieved.) The Secretary said in response that he hoped to be
            able to talk about how we could both deal with this problem in longer terms. The U.S.
            appreciates the prepayments which Germany has made on the offset. Both of our countries
            have balance of payments problems. We must roll up our sleeves and see what we can do
            about it.</p>
                    <p>President Luebke assured the Secretary that the Germans would seek for all possible
            solutions. He had one idea, for example, in the form of a new anti-tank weapon—which
            could perhaps be developed in the U.S. on a cheap, mass produced basis for the defense
            of Germany. Since the Soviets have 40,000 tanks, the alliance would have a very
            considerable problem in stopping them in the event of attack. At the moment there is
            little to counter them. The President suggested a new type of mine might be developed
            which could be sown to stop tanks. The Secretary replied that as a former infantryman he
            had an equal interest in stopping tanks. He would talk with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> about the possibilities that might be afforded.
            He referred to the light-weight rockets and missiles which had been developed in
            connection with our Vietnamese operations. This may open up new developments which could
            be applicable in Germany. Perhaps helicopters could be used for spotting tanks.</p>

                    <p>The Secretary made some humorous introductory remarks to the effect that the U.S. was
            often in the position of asking its friends for help. Now, because of our balance of
            payments difficulties, we are asking the Germans to prepay 214 million dollars on the
              <gloss target="#t_GARIOA1">GARIOA</gloss> (Government and Relief in Occupied Areas)
            and Marshall Plan Loans. Our balance of payments had been bad for the first quarter.</p>
                    <p>He realized that the Germans had balance of payments problems of their own; however, he
            hoped that they would give careful consideration to this request. The Chancellor replied
            that the Germans, of course, had balance of payments problems of their own—more serious,
            he considered, than those of the U.S. Their deficit would, over the next three years,
            average a billion dollars a year. It was, however, in keeping with our friendship that
            the Germans consider any proposal we make.</p>

                    <p>The Chancellor would like to ask one thing—that we not talk about acute issues between
            us in public. He referred specifically to the question of whether there would be a
            reduction of American forces in the absence <pb n="369" xml:id="pg_369" facs="0399"/>of
            full offset payments. The German press is unfortunately not yet mature. It tends to
            distort such issues. In fact, he would prefer no public discussion at all of such
            matters.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary replied that he would report what the Chancellor had said to the
            President. To be quite frank, we have not yet discovered ourselves how to keep
            Government officials from talking. The President greatly values the friendship of the
            Chancellor, and would not wish to do anything that disturbed him. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> thought it would be desirable for the Chancellor and
            the President to correspond with each other more often—particularly if they are troubled
            by important matters. He knows this to be the President's wish.</p>

                    <p>The Chancellor assured the Secretary of continued German support of American policy in
            Viet-Nam. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> replied that the
            President greatly appreciates the Chancellor's support on South Viet-Nam. He could tell
            the Chancellor that opposition is growing in America to U.S. policy in South
            Viet-Nam—however, not for a weaker but for a strong line.</p>

                    <p>The Chancellor asked whether China is likely to come into the conflict. Secretary
              <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> replied that he was unable to give a direct
            answer to this question. He did, however, want to point out that it was a question not
            applicable only to one side. All the Secretary could say is that we are committed to
            doing what is required in South Viet-Nam.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor asked whether South Viet-Nam will eventually be able to organize itself
            politically to carry on the conflict. The Secretary replied that there are many divisive
            and conflicting interests within South Viet-Nam. They are, however, united in the
            determination not to be defeated by the Viet Cong. There is every prospect now for
            elections in September which will result in the creation of a body which could represent
            all the various elements in South Viet-Nam seeking the defeat of the Viet Cong.</p>

                    <p>1. I can understand your surprise and concern that Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> would attribute to you a statement in your
            meeting with him held on June 9th which you did not in fact make. The almost verbatim
            minutes of this meeting which I sent you clearly indicate that you made no statement on
            the level of US forces or the relationship between this level and German offset
            payments. Despite this the official transcript of Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s press conference June 10 states as follows: “I
            specifically received yesterday in my talk with the American Secretary of State the
            assurance that the presence of the American troops in Europe, and particularly in
            Germany, is in itself an obligation and task which cannot be directly linked to German
            purchases of weapons in America—no matter how desirable such purchases naturally are,
            particularly in light of the burdens which the US must bear because of the war in
            Viet-Nam.”</p>
                    <p>2. The substance of this statement was reported to the Department on June 10 (Embtel
              4095)<note n="4" xml:id="d153fn4">Not found.</note> and it is this statement which was
            quoted by <pb n="371" xml:id="pg_371" facs="0401"/>the <hi rend="italic">New York
              Times</hi> article of June 11. This article was carried by the European
            Saturday-Sunday edition under a Reuters byline rather than Tom Hamilton's. In my own
            background briefing after your meeting I made it clear to the American press,
            particularly in response to questions by Hamilton, that the troop level issue had not
            arisen; no one raised the question of linkage and I did not volunteer it. Hamilton's
            story of the 9th was well within the guidance and did not attribute to you the remarks
            referred to by <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>.</p>
                    <p>3. I can offer no explanation for <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s
            action except that he and his government have consistently sought to put the best face
            possible on the question of troop levels and any possible linkage with the offset. Since
            you have consistently been quoted as denying that there would be any substantial
            reduction in US forces (your press conference of May 27)<note n="5" xml:id="d153fn5">For
              text, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, June 13, 1966, pp.
              918–925.</note> and have not confirmed the offset linkage either when approached by
            Amb <persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName> in Washington or when the question
            was raised by the Chancellor in your meeting of June 9, the Chancellor apparently felt
            that he was at least expressing your views in quoting what you in fact did not say at
            that time. This is of course not cricket, however, I don't believe it results from any
            Machiavellian type of gamesmanship on the Chancellor's part. He values his relationship
            with the US and particularly with Pres. <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>
            and with you too highly for this. He does, however, have a problem which arises from the
            constant spate of news stories emanating from Washington threatening troop withdrawal of
            various counts including a proportional withdrawal if the offset is not made. It has
            become generally known that <gloss target="#t_Sec1">Sec</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> made such a statement to <persName corresp="#p_HKU1">Von Hassel</persName> during their recent meeting, though this
            has never been confirmed by any other high US official or publicly by <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> even in his statement of June 11th.<note n="6" xml:id="d153fn6">For text, see <hi rend="italic">Public Statements of Secretary of
                Defense <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">Robert S. McNamara</persName>, 1966</hi>, vol.
              7, p. 2363.</note> The closest thing to an official denial is that reported by Under
            SecDef Vance in his background press conference June 9. (<gloss target="#t_USCINCEUR1">USCINCEUR</gloss> 092105Z)<note n="7" xml:id="d153fn7">Not found.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>4. Quite frankly, I don't think that anything can be done about this issue until we can
            come up with one US policy on the offset. It is not credible that there be a separate
              <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> policy on such an important issue. On
            the other hand, the fact that <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> has such
            an attitude continues to boil up in the German press, creating embarrassment for the
            German Government and handicapping us in the excution of our overall policy here.</p>
                    <p>In fact, the <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> statement of June 11 is
            precisely what the Chancellor asked that we not do, i.e. continue to air the question in
            public—which assures that it will be reverberating in the press here just as <pb n="372" xml:id="pg_372" facs="0402"/>the Germans start their critical bilateral talks with the
            French on the troop issue.</p>
                    <p>5. It is one thing to put strong pressure on the German Government to meet the offset
            privately, which in the past has been reasonably effective. The President should of
            course do this when he sees the Chancellor in July or August, although I would hope that
            he would, as in the past, stop short of threats of proportionate reduction if the offset
            is not met. It is quite a separate thing, however, to make threatening or critical
            public statements focusing on what is, from the German standpoint, such a vital issue.
              <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s statement of June 11, although it
            does not contain the direct threat of proportional withdrawal, certainly falls into this
            category—particularly the statement “I never consider the termination clause until we
            are ready to invoke it.” You can be assured that this statement, which has no relevance
            to the offset issue as I understand it, will be with us for some time. The lead article
            in Die Welt today, which is being reported separately is “<persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s heavy hand.”</p>
                    <p>6. As regards the level of US forces here, I believe that we should all stick with your
            statement of May 27 to the effect that “Our forces will remain there as long as they are
            needed and wanted” and that—“We do not anticipate withdrawing any major units from
              <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.” We should not, I believe, elaborate on this or
            give any impression of impending change—unless or until a final decision for such change
            is made.</p>

                    <p>The President welcomed Dr. Barzel and hoped he would enjoy his stay here.</p>
                    <p>Barzel expressed his gratification to the President for seeing him a second time.<note n="2" xml:id="d154fn2">See <ref target="#d97">Document 97</ref>.</note> He explained
            the purpose of his current trip, namely to give some lectures at the German Embassy
            today and in New York tomorrow. He said he had good meetings also with Jewish
            organizations.</p>
                    <p>The President referred to the observations Dr. Barzel intended to make on German
            reunification and said he had asked his staff to give them careful study. The President
            assured Barzel of his deep concern for the continued security of Europe and the success
            of the German people. On <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, he wanted Dr. Barzel to
            know that we are concerned, but that we are not picking a fight with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>; we viewed <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName>'s actions more in sorrow than in anger. The President said he looked
            forward with great pleasure to seeing Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> again.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Barzel said he had received a telegram from Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> asking him to convey warm greetings to the
            President. The Chancellor said in his telegram that he too looked forward to the meeting
            with the President. The Chancellor wished especially to discuss with the President the
            offset problem and would be bringing with him some definite proposals of his own. The
            Chancellor also hoped that discussion of this subject could be kept out of the public
            domain.</p>
                    <p>The President said he agreed, that it was not right to try one's case in the
            newspapers. He would do his part to see that such matters not leak and hoped that
            Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> would do the same.</p>
                    <p>Barzel referred to his comments regarding the Great Society, made when he saw the
            President in 1965. He noted with approval the trip of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> Minister of Health, Dr. Schwarzhaupt, to the United States and Secretary
              <persName corresp="#p_USL1">Udall</persName> to Germany. He said we should undertake
            more cooperative efforts like this.</p>
                    <p>The President expressed his appreciation for what the Germans had done in the domestic
            field, commenting on the Peace Corps and the achievements in the material resources
            field. He said he would like to see some of the fine German virtues transplanted to
            other countries. Their contribution to the shaping of our society had been great. The
            President referred in this connection to his own grandmother of German stock from whom
            he had learned the virtues of prudence and thrift. He said he didn't want to tell
            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> this, but if he succeeded in
            balancing the federal budget, he would attribute this success to his own
            grandmother.</p>
                    <p>Barzel said the Germans recognized and understood fully the big job the United States
            was doing. Germans valued the U.S. keeping its <pb n="374" xml:id="pg_374" facs="0404"/>commitments. Barzel said Berliners appreciated this in particular and would like to
            tell the President so personally in Berlin.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rostow commented that Dr. Barzel had earlier attributed the growing moderation in
            Asia and Latin America to what we did in Viet-Nam.</p>
                    <p>The President said we thought the fruits of our efforts in Viet-Nam have been, are and
            will be reflected in the attitudes and conduct of other nations. He referred to what an
            ambassador of a powerful country had said to him recently after seeing Castro. The Cuban
            dictator saw no point in exhausting his treasury to undermine the rest of the Americas
            if the Russians run out on him as they did over missiles, while the Americans do what
            they did in the Dominican Republic. The President hoped other aggressors or would-be
            aggressors get the message. The President said we would have been guilty of deceit and
            hypocrisy if we had allowed North Viet-Nam to swallow South Viet-Nam and Thailand and
            Malaysia. We have served notice that we intend to stop aggression. We would like the
            Germans and Britons to take note of that and say so. We would like moral encouragement
            from our friends. The President said he thinks others ought to stand up to be
            counted.</p>
                    <p>Barzel said he was greatly impressed with the President's remarks. He said Germans did
            want to make a greater contribution in the humanitarian field.</p>
                    <p>The President assured Barzel that we would keep our commitments. He stated that while
            he did not share the Chancellor's and the general German view that, for the common
            defense, we need all the troops we now have in Germany, he appreciates the psychological
            factors involved in cutting back. He thought, moreover, that <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> was tough enough to convince him to leave them
            there, but added that the Germans must reimburse us for our military foreign exchange
            expenditures. We have an agreement—we will keep it; the Chancellor has an agreement—we
            have no doubt he will keep it. And we should not waste too much time talking about
            it.</p>
                    <p>Barzel promised to carry the President's view to <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> and to help <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> in
            Parliament so he could cope with this problem.</p>
                    <p>The President reiterated his great confidence in the Germans, in their understanding of
            financial matters and of U.S. problems. He asked Barzel to tell <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> it was easier for him to get a boy back home
            than a dollar.</p>
                    <p>The President concluded by saying that he wanted Barzel to reassure <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> that <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> would always be kept well informed about any U.S. plans which
            touched German interests. The President said he would continue to share his confidence
            with <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> as long as he represented the U.S.
            government.</p>

                    <p>Dear Mr. President,</p>
                    <p>Recently we had the visit of Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Dean
              Rusk</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d155fn2">See <ref target="#d149">Documents
                149</ref>-<ref target="#d152">152</ref>.</note> I had a long talk with him and found
            to my great pleasure that full agreement was discernible concerning the big political
            issues. Herr Schroder also told me about the very good co-operation that existed between
            him and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> at the Brussels <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Conference.<note n="3" xml:id="d155fn3">See <ref target="#d148">Document 148</ref>. A summary of the <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>-Schroeder discussions was transmitted to the Department of State in
              telegram <gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 48 from Brussels, June 6. (Department
              of State, Central Files, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 1 <gloss target="#t_GER1">GER</gloss> W–US)</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>In this difficult phase I feel that it is of decisive importance for the fourteen
              <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> partners who want to continue the alliance in
            its present integrated form to take a clear and firm position. Only then we do have a
            chance, as I hope, to come to satisfactory results with France although I do by no means
            underestimate the difficulties of the forthcoming negotiations. The decisive point
            is—and this, I believe, is the view of all <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
            partners—that France should undertake clear commitments for an emergency regarding her
            troops stationed in Germany.</p>
                    <p>In respect of the question of the future development of East-West relations the German
            and the United States Governments also hold the same views—which, incidentally, appear
            to be shared by the French Government as well as far as we are able to gather from
            reports available so far on the talks conducted by the French President in the Soviet
            Union. We should seize every reasonable opportunity to improve relations with the east
            European countries. In this connexion, however, I wish to assure you that any European
            talk without the decisive co-operation of the United States will be neither conceivable
            nor acceptable to the Federal Government.</p>
                    <p>Our peace note of 25 March 1966 is an attempt to prepare the ground for an
            understanding. We are happy to note that our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
            partners and many other Governments have shown a very positive attitude towards it. The
            reaction of the east European countries is, as could be expected, predominantly a
            negative one, although there are indications that some of them, including the Soviet
            Union itself, are interested in our proposal to make declarations on the non-use of
            force.</p>
                    <p>The disarmament negotiations in Geneva which have been resumed meet with our interest
            and full attention. We believe that the efforts to <pb n="376" xml:id="pg_376" facs="0406"/>achieve a non-proliferation agreement should be continued, but that—as is
            provided in the American draft—the possibility must not be excluded of building up in
            the future a joint integrated nuclear force among those partners of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> alliance who are prepared to do so.</p>
                    <p>Finally I talked with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> about the
              <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> Round and the foreign exchange offset
            for the U.S. troops stationed in Germany. I am pleased to note that the preparations for
            the <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> Round have made good progress at the
            latest Council meeting in Brussels. The Council of Ministers of the European Economic
            Community has now issued mandates to the Commission concerning all hitherto open sectors
            of the industrial field.</p>
                    <p>The offset problem undoubtedly confronts us with difficult questions. We shall,
            however, do what is possible for us to find a solution acceptable also to the United
            States. In this connexion, however, consideration should also be given to payments and
            services other than the mere purchase of weapons and military equipment. In my view,
            which I hope is shared by you, this set of problems should, however, not be linked up
            with the question of the future presence in Germany of U.S. troops. This would all too
            easily give rise to an approach that would not do justice to the friendship between our
            two countries and to our common task.</p>
                    <p>I also spoke with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> about a meeting with
              you<note n="4" xml:id="d155fn4">A memorandum of the portion of their conversation
              dealing with this question is ibid., Conference Files: Lot 67 D 305, CF 30.</note> and
            told him that I shall be happy to see you again. In view of my own plans a date around 8
            September would be most convenient to me, but, needless to say, I shall accept any other
            date which you may suggest. I know only too well—and I feel with you—what heavy
            responsibility rests on your shoulders just at the present time.</p>

            helpful to review the principal outstanding issues between the Germans and ourselves—in
            order to establish how they might best be dealt with.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. Offset.</p>
                    <p>The present single greatest source of friction between ourselves and the Germans, which
            could be even greater in the future, is the offset agreement. Although the Germans have
            a year remaining to complete their agreed payments for the current two-year period (i.
            e., ending July 1, 1967) they are behind on pro-rata payments, even including the
            promised <gloss target="#t_DM1">DM</gloss> 1 billion pre-payment, and badly behind on
            orders. This has led to a natural apprehension on the part of responsible officials in
            the US Govt, whose consequent actions have been construed by the Germans as casting
            doubt on their commitment to meet their current obligations and as attempts to force
            them to buy weapons which they consider unnecessary. Strong German press attacks have
            been made against <gloss target="#t_Sec1">Sec</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and strong political attacks against
              <persName corresp="#p_HKU1">Von Hassel</persName> and even Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>. The current issue of Stern has an article
            entitled “Why don't you retire, Mr. Minister?” <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>
            Deputy Birrenbach told Amb <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> on July 2 that
            this issue could bring down the Chancellor's government.<note n="2" xml:id="d156fn2">For

                    <p>Our immediate objective in this circumstance should, I believe, be to utilize the two
            meetings in such a way as to:</p>
                    <p>A) Reestablish an easy working basis of confidence and rapport between us such as
            existed at the time of the <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_HKU1">Von Hassel</persName> Washington meeting of June 1964. For our
            part we should, I believe, be willing to make it clear that we have confidence that the
            Germans will meet the current payments offset. We should urge the Germans to include
            provision for the offset in their 1967 budget and continue our efforts to find weapons
            that the Germans will be willing to purchase without undue pressure. We should in public
            statements on this subject concentrate on the harmony and constructive aspects of our
            defense relationship, which are indeed very great.</p>

                    <p>B) We should, at the same time, lay the groundwork for the negotiation of a new offset
            agreement, since the beginning of a new orders period is only some six months away. We
            know that the Germans will attempt to better the present agreement, certainly through
            the inclusion of other than military items and possibly through a scaledown of the
            total. Under the assumption that the US has postponed action on a multilateral offset
            approach we should, I believe, determine as a matter of policy how far we are willing to
            go to meet the German desires and initiate negotiations. These should, however, be
            conducted at least at the Ministerial level since they will involve matters of great
            political sensitivity—considerations going beyond those which have in the past been
            discussed at the Sullivan/Kuss level.</p>
                    <p>My more complete views of the future of the offset are fully set forth in Embtel

            unilateral withdrawal or as a complement to some future Soviet withdrawal. German doubts
            on the former have always been with us. Uncertainties concerning the latter have

            short, since there is to the best of my knowledge no present plan to reduce the level of
            US forces, we should continue to state this clearly. We should also point out that,
            although we hope that some day we will be able to reduce US force levels in Europe,
            complementary withdrawals are at present a moot question. Any Soviet withdrawal would
            have to be analyzed carefully by <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> itself, both in

            forces but our strategic forces. If this change of emphasis can be accomplished there
            is, I believe, some chance that a non-proliferation agreement, which I consider a very

            strict and co-ordinated priority on the demands we make on the German Govt with respect

            agreement; b) pre-payment of US loans; c) suitable overall level of aid budget and new
            obligational authorities; d) only in rare cases should we press for specific changes in
            German aid allocations to particular countries or international institutions. These

                    <p>There is at this time little if any difference between the Germans and ourselves as to
            the actions which will have to be taken by the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> as
            a result of the recent French initiatives. At some stage, however, there could well be a
            difference as to how to deal with French troops in Germany. When this negotiation comes
            to its “crunch,” which will presumably occur in Paris between the 14 and the French,
              <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> will be under strong pressure from
            within the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_CSU1">CSU</gloss> to
            keep the French troops here under almost any conditions. One key issue in the
            negotiation will hinge around the question of the “automaticity” of French troops coming
            under <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> command. We should, I believe, in both
            upcoming meetings, stiffen the Germans against this eventuality. We should point out the
            danger to the integrity of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and its integrated
            command—in the event the French are able to retain their privileges without assuming
            clear obligations. We should point out that if there were to occur a disintegration of

            any hope for success at this time. Our views as to how to handle the situation should

            to make. We will be glad to see Four-Power (Western) discussion of the subject
            initiated—perhaps in a new forum created for this purpose. We will be glad to consider
            the possibility of a Four-Power commission of experts (including Soviets) plus German

                    <p>The German peace note of last March was symptomatic of their perceptible movement to

            order to keep up the momentum, we should encourage action on these two points during the
            Chancellor's visit to Washington. In particular we should urge the Germans, without
            being too specific, to soften their present facade on the Oder-Neisse and
            Heimatrecht-self determination issues. We will amplify our views on this question in a

                    <p>1. The <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> (Deputy Assistant Secretary Ruete)
            yesterday called in the <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss>'s of the three Embassies to
            present a memorandum<note n="3" xml:id="d157fn3">Transmitted to the Department of State
              in airgram A–58, July 15. (Ibid.)</note> revising last year's German proposal for a
            negative Berlin clause. <persName corresp="#p_RHH1">Ruete</persName> said that the
            proposal should not be considered sacrosanct as it now stands. He hoped that the three
            powers would study it carefully and present their views on it to the <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> within a reasonable period of time.</p>
                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_RHH1">Ruete</persName> explained that the same reasons which
            had led <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> Schroeder to present the negative
            Berlin clause proposal at the Quadripartite <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> dinner
            on May 10, 1965<note n="4" xml:id="d157fn4">See <ref target="#d111">Document
              111</ref>.</note> still applied. The unfortunate leak of the proposal to the press had
            caused the <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> to delay a year before pursuing it.
            However, the Germans had had indications from various East European Communist countries
            that, while a specific Berlin clause was unacceptable, Berlin could de facto be included
            in trade agreements and possibly other agreements as well. In view of these indications,
            the FonOff thought it worthwhile to attempt to bridge the gap between the German
            requirement of a specific Berlin clause and the Communist inability to accept one by the
            device of the negative Berlin clause.</p>
                    <p>3. The German proposal as redrafted makes the following recommendations.</p>
                    <p>(A) The govts of the Three Powers and the Allied Kommandatura (<gloss target="#t_AK1">AK</gloss>) Berlin would agree by amending <gloss target="#t_BKCL1">BKC/L</gloss>
            (52) 6 of May 21, 1952<note n="5" xml:id="d157fn5">For text, see <hi rend="italic">Documents on Germany, 1944–1985</hi>, pp. 372–374.</note> so that, even without a
            special Berlin clause or an appropriate declaration, Berlin is in principle considered
            to be included in any international agreement concluded by the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> with another state.</p>
                    <p>(B) This would not affect the right of the <gloss target="#t_AK1">AK</gloss> Berlin to
            object in individual cases to the inclusion of Berlin in international agreements. In
            order to safeguard this <gloss target="#t_AK1">AK</gloss> right in theory and practice,
            the Germans suggest:</p>
                    <p>(1) Where time permits, each agreement be submitted through the Senat to the <gloss target="#t_AK1">AK</gloss> in the same way as has hitherto been done under the
            provisions <pb n="382" xml:id="pg_382" facs="0412"/>of <gloss target="#t_BKCL1">BKC/L</gloss> (52) 6. If the <gloss target="#t_AK1">AK</gloss> objected to the
            inclusion of Berlin, the Fed Govt would make a statement to the Contracting Party (the
            depository power in the case of multilateral agreements) to the effect that Berlin was
            not included.</p>
                    <p>(2) When time does not permit the use of normal procedure, the Fed Govt would, upon
            conclusion of an agreement, make a special declaration reserving the right to declare
            later that the agreement should not apply to Berlin.</p>
                    <p>(3) Obviously the normal procedure is preferable in the case of Communist states.
            However, if the Fed Govt should need to conclude an agreement on short notice, the govt
            would send the text of the proposed agreement to the three Embassies in Bonn whose
            concurrence, if obtained, would be binding on the <gloss target="#t_AK1">AK</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>4. Elsewhere, the memorandum rejects the idea of a German declaration, negative or
            positive, to be made upon the conclusion of an agreement stating that it shall apply to
            Berlin. However worded, this procedure would in all likelihood be resisted by a
            Communist Contracting Party with the result that the dissent would come to light.</p>
                    <p>5. Full text of the memorandum follows by priority airgram.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Comment</p>
                    <p>6. Obviously, the German proposal will require careful study before a decision on it
            can be reached. In our view, an overriding consideration in any such examination should
            be to attempt to find a way to accommodate the German desire to move ahead in its
            Eastern policy which is now stalled over the Berlin clause issue. We feel we should
            defer to the German estimate that this procedure may be implicitly acceptable to the
            European Communist countries who, by letting it pass unchallenged, could hope to reap
            the benefits of trade and other agreements with the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
            which are now denied to them.</p>
                    <p>7. On first heading, it appears to us that the German proposal meets the requirements
            of Allied sovereignty in Berlin except possibly in respect to para 3 B (3) above. We are
            dubious about this proposal which will require the <gloss target="#t_AK1">AK</gloss> to
            accept, without examination, decisions made by the three Embassies under extreme time
            pressure.</p>
                    <p>8. It is apparent that if the Communist countries take issue with this procedure, it
            will have to be dropped as a false start. However, even if the Communist countries let
            it pass, the British in particular are likely to question whether the procedure really
            reflects the intention of both Contracting Parties to allow an agreement to apply to
            Berlin. We know from previous conversations with the British that they are opposed in
            principle to any procedure for applying treaties to Berlin which smacks of automaticity.
            Nevertheless, it seems to us that the Communist countries will always have the option
            open to them of declaring that they do not intend an agreement to apply to Berlin. If
            they fail to exercise this option, we can reasonably argue that in fact they do not
            object to the application of an agreement to Berlin, particularly if in informal
            soundings during <pb n="383" xml:id="pg_383" facs="0413"/>the course of negotiations the
            Germans have determined that a specific Communist country is willing to accept the de
            facto application of the agreement in Berlin.</p>
                    <p>9. We agreed with the reps of the other Embassies that Bonn was the most suitable
            locale for discussion of the proposal. We suggest, therefore, that Berlin comment on the
            proposal upon receipt of the full text while we shall await the <gloss target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss>'s views before commencing tripartite discussions here.<note n="6" xml:id="d157fn6">In telegram 13901 to Berlin, July 22, the Department of State replied
              that it concurred with the Embassy recommendation, adding: “German memorandum
              sufficiently sensitive to Allied requirements to serve as basis for tripartite
              discussions.” The telegram gave a positive evaluation of the “negative Berlin clause.”

            Defense Minister <persName corresp="#p_HKU1">Von Hassel</persName> in Paris on Monday
            and Tuesday:<note n="2" xml:id="d158fn2">July 25 and 26. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> was in Paris for the Ministerial Meeting of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Nuclear Planning Working Group. A report on the
              meeting is in <ref target="frus1964-68v13#d189">
                                <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1964–1968, vol. XIII, Document
              189</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">German budget</hi>. The German cabinet on Monday apparently
            decided on a 1967 defense budget of 18.5 billion <gloss target="#t_DM1">DM</gloss>, an
            amount almost 2 billion below the Ministry's original estimates of requirements. The
            austerity of this figure results from the combination of an apparent inability to
            increase revenues and political pressures to devote more expenditures to social welfare.
            (This 18.5 billion is totally inadequate to finance the qualitative improvements in the
            German forces which are required if <pb n="384" xml:id="pg_384" facs="0414"/>they are to
            be relied on to fight alongside us; it follows, too, that the 18.5 billion is totally
            inadequate to cover the German-US offset for 1967. Germany—which spends about 5 per cent
            of her <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> on defense as compared with our more than 8.5
            per cent—made an almost 50 per cent increase in military expenditures between 1961 and
            1963, but has leveled off since then. Taking account of inflation, military expenditures
            for 1966 will be one-eighth lower than in 1963; and expenditures in 1967 may not be much
            more.)</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">German-<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> offset</hi>. The British
            are trying to get a full offset of their roughly 1 billion <gloss target="#t_DM1">DM</gloss> foreign exchange drain attributable to their forces in Germany. The
            Germans now cover 300 million, 100 million of which is in non-military purchases. The
            Germans do not propose to accede to the British request. They are proposing that a
              <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>-German team find ways to cut the fat out of the
            British deployments (perhaps 10–15,000 men). Among the measures to be considered is
            basing of <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> aircraft in Britain instead of in Germany.
            The Germans think that by such savings, the British can cut the 1 billion <gloss target="#t_DM1">DM</gloss> drain to perhaps 660 million. The Germans offer to cover
            half of that remainder—i.e., roughly what they are covering now.</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">German-US offset</hi>. The Germans state flatly that they cannot
            agree to a full US offset for 1967–68. <persName corresp="#p_HKU1">Von
              Hassel</persName> was talking in terms that sounded very much like their proposal to
            the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> (above)—of an undertaking to offset 50 per cent
            with best efforts made to buy more than that. It was clear that <persName corresp="#p_HKU1">Von Hassel</persName> was under instructions from the Chancellor
            and that he was expecting the Chancellor, with his small military budget already in
            concrete, to settle the offset matter with you in September. Until the “French problem”
            in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> is over, the Germans will not be ready to
            propose to us one thing they proposed to the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>—the
            establishment of a US-German team to see how US forces in Germany can be cut without
            affecting combat capability. (I made clear that the United States does not want Germany
            to buy anything from us that they do not need or that they can buy better or cheaper
            elsewhere, but that it was perfectly clear that Germany needs a good deal of equipment
            to bring their forces up to proper standards. I also said we would be ready when they
            are to join in joint efforts to trim our forces in Germany.)</p>
                    <p>4. <hi rend="italic">“Hardware.”</hi> The Germans want to keep on talking about
            hardware, but specifically suggested, in connection with hardware as an item on the
            agenda of the “<persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> Committee,” that
            discussion of that subject come “later.”</p>
                    <p>5. <hi rend="italic">“<persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> Committee.”</hi>
            The Germans support making permanent the small “<persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> Committee” of Defense Ministers to discuss nuclear planning
            matters. They want to avoid getting crosswise with their allies with respect to limiting
            membership on the Group however, and they want to avoid a “constitutional” clash with
            the French when the <pb n="385" xml:id="pg_385" facs="0415"/>North Atlantic Council must
            act on the proposal. They obviously favor continuation of such a Group.</p>
                    <p>6. <hi rend="italic">“Unprovoked attack.”</hi>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HKU1">Von Hassel</persName> reported a conversation with French
            Defense Minister <persName corresp="#p_MP5">Messmer</persName> which took place during
            General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>'s visit to Bonn. According to
              <persName corresp="#p_MP5">Messmer</persName>, the French would be “with us” in the
            event of trouble in Berlin. In the event of “escalation of the war in Vietnam,”
              <persName corresp="#p_MP5">Messmer</persName> thought the Soviets would be deterred by
              <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> power from attacking in the West; but, if the
            Soviets did attack in such circumstances, the French would decide at the time whether to
            participate.</p>
                    <p>7. <hi rend="italic">French troops in Germany</hi>. The Germans believe that the first
            problem is to find a mission for the French forces in Germany and that this should not
            be difficult “since five of the six brigades are in reserve status anyway.” Despite the
            fact that it has been made clear to them that France will not join in the “presumption”
            that she will be with the Alliance in case of war (see above), the Germans want the
            French forces to remain in Germany. <persName corresp="#p_HKU1">Von Hassel</persName>
            said it would be “a great shock to both countries if the French troops left.” He
            concluded that his own view was that the French forces would remain in Germany.</p>

                    <p>These two [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]
            reports on German politics give a pretty clear picture of what <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> is up against.<note n="2" xml:id="d159fn2">Attached but not printed are two July 12 reports.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>1. Both <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> and Barzel are out to remove
            him, soon or late.</p>
                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> is trying to push <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> and Schroeder into a Moscow trip in which they
            will fail. He then would like to see Germany look to “Europe”—which means France,
            essentially—for greater nuclear status.</p>
                    <pb n="386" xml:id="pg_386" facs="0416"/>
                    <p>3. Barzel, on the other hand, looks to inflaming the German unity issue and using
              <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s inability to make progress as a way
            of forcing him out. He, too, looks to a reduction in U.S.-German relations and an
            intensification of Germany's relations with the French.</p>
                    <p>All such reports tend to present a somewhat unbalanced view of a politician's position.
            In my view, neither <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> nor Barzel would, in
            fact, radically reduce the U.S.-German connection. But they do suggest the rise of
            assertive nationalism in Germany already evident in the way they are handling the offset
            issue.</p>
                    <p>These reports should also be read against the background of rising strength in the
            Social Democratic opposition to the <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>
            coalition.</p>
                    <p>We shall, of course, take readings on <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s
            political position closer to the time of his visit. These reports are an interim picture
            of the kind of trouble he has in his own political family.</p>

                    <p>1834. For Under Secretary from Hillenbrand. Ref: State 26106.<note n="2" xml:id="d160fn2">Telegram 26106 to Bonn, August 12, requested “your latest personal
              estimate of the problems of the 1967 German defense budget and offset.” (Ibid.)</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>1. In terms of any realistic assessment, I must judge the offset prospects to be bleak.
            The base statistics available at this time indicate an estimated German need for funds
            in the amount of $705 million during the first six months of 1967 if the payments part
            of the current offset agreement is to be met. This is on the assumption that the Federal
            Government, with the assistance of the Bundesbank, will be able to borrow $250 million
            on a short or medium term basis, to make the special payment before the end of 1966 to
            which the Germans are committed. Present German thinking is that the defense budget for
            fiscal year 1967 will be between <pb n="387" xml:id="pg_387" facs="0417"/>18.0 and 18.5
            billion <gloss target="#t_DM1">DM</gloss>, although there will be heavy pressure on
              <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> to pare this down further in the
            process of squeezing the overall budget down to the <gloss target="#t_DM1">DM</gloss> 74
            billion which the Cabinet has fixed as the maximum permissible (the squeeze will be even
            more intense if the Federal Government loses a further billion <gloss target="#t_DM1">DM</gloss> or so in the tussle with the Laender over the percentage of income tax
            revenue to be retained by Bonn).</p>
                    <p>2. Our best guess is that, given a <gloss target="#t_DM1">DM</gloss> 19 billion defense
            budget for 1967, the Federal Government could probably not raise more than <gloss target="#t_DM1">DM</gloss> 1.6 billion ($400 million) for offset payments in 1967.
            (This would essentially represent re-payment against anticipated orders. The recorded
            total of orders through June 30, 1966 for the two-year orders period ending December 31,
            1966 is only $630 million.) Even after such a payment the Germans would be some $300
            million short of the offset total of $1350 for the two-year payments period ending June
            30, 1967. There would be nothing left for payments on any new offset agreement during
            the last six months of 1967. Although there are clearly political and financial limits
            to borrowing from the market through the Bundesbank, this source might be used to raise
            further amounts on a short or medium term loan basis during 1967 (Bundesbank approval
            would have to be obtained), to meet the $300 million shortfall and possibly to provide
            some funds for a new agreement.</p>
                    <p>3. The essential problem, as I see it, is not the general state of the German economy
            which appears to be taking a turn for the better (Bonn 1812)<note n="3" xml:id="d160fn3">Dated August 11. (Department of State, Central Files, E 2 <gloss target="#t_GER1">GER</gloss> W)</note> but the built-in rigidities of the German revenue and
            budgetary systems. It is, of course, of great political importance to Chancellor
              <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> that he successfully steer through the
            legislature his economic stabilization bill, and concern about the overheated German
            economy and pockets of distress such as the Ruhr is strongly influencing the general
            atmosphere within which the budget is being discussed. The fact remains that even
            without this concern the budgetary possibilities of the government would be severely
            limited. The only immediate real solution would lie in a tax increase (including income
            tax), but <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s weakened political position
            makes this seem impracticable. Over a longer period a reduction of subsidies and strict
            control over increases in social programs would permit rising revenues again to provide
            more for defense.</p>
                    <p>4. It is clear that even a vigorous Presidential message plus follow-through would not
            change this basic situation. It might however help protect the defense budget from
            further cuts—perhaps on a scale of $100 million. What we had in mind in Bonn 1600<note n="4" xml:id="d160fn4">Dated August 5. (Ibid., FN 15 <gloss target="#t_GER1">GER</gloss> W)</note> was the desirability of getting <pb n="388" xml:id="pg_388" facs="0418"/>something on the record before the late-August Cabinet discussions at
            which the Defense Ministry share of the overall budget total will be fixed. The language
            which we suggested seemed calculated to make our point while causing minimum irritation
            and expressing confidence in German good intentions about the offset.</p>
                    <p>5. There is no doubt that the offset issue, in the context of prevailing confusion here
            about U.S. intentions on troop presence, has become politically highly sensitive. The
            Chancellor will find it difficult to be accommodating to us without laying himself open
            to the charge of his enemies that he is proving intolerably weak in the face of U.S.
            pressure. Public and private discussion of U.S. policy towards Germany has become
            heated, with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> the prime object
            of attack. For the first time in my recollection, we are hearing irrational reactions
            from some important politicians to the effect that if the Americans are going to be so
            penny-pinching and unreasonable in their demands, ignoring their own security interests
            in Europe, than let them take their troops out. Needless to say, this is a line of
            argument which plays directly into <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>'s
            hands. Fortunately, it is not by any means a prevailing sentiment, but the climate of
            discussion is not healthy and is greatly complicated by the daily rash of stories in the
            press reporting alleged Washington plans for unilateral troop reductions,
            denuclearization of the Bundeswehr, and a general turning of our back on Europe. There
            is some evidence that the Chancellor himself feels bruised, and is nursing a certain
            sense of grievance because of what he considers to have been a series of disappointments
            with the U.S.</p>
                    <p>6. I would conclude, therefore, that a major effort which would inevitably become
            public [toward?] the Germans on the offset would, at this point, be likely to backfire.
            It would further weaken <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s position and
            seriously and negatively affect U.S.-German relations. It would certainly strengthen the
            position of those who feel that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> is
            basically right about the future of Europe. Our desire to avoid these results would not
            be incompatible with a private reminder to the Chancellor, of the kind we had suggested,
            that he should try to avoid coming to Washington with a completely frozen position. I
            definitely do not believe however that we should clobber the Germans, publicly or in
            private, at this point, or make threats. We should also try to refrain from public
            statements or backgrounding of a type which does not persuade the Germans but merely
            hardens their resistance. The general posture suggested in Bonn 286<note n="5" xml:id="d160fn5">
                            <ref target="#d156">Document 156</ref>.</note> still appears relevant.</p>
                    <p>7. We are obviously going to have to move soon towards some fairly basic decisions
            which will affect our future relations with the Federal <pb n="389" xml:id="pg_389" facs="0419"/>Republic. We will need to establish some priorities among the various
            objectives we seek to achieve in Europe, not all of which may be completely compatible
            with each other. This will require some hard thinking about the kind of offset we can
            realistically expect to achieve for the period after June 30, 1967, and above all how
            much pressure we can apply to achieve our objectives both within the present and
            projected new offset agreements without jeopardizing other major policy goals.</p>

                    <p>2012. Subject: The state of German-American relations seen from Bonn.</p>
                    <p>1. A calm has descended over Bonn. The captains, kings, and just plain politicians have
            departed on their summer holidays, and most items in the press are likely to be a
            regurgitation of the old rather than a revelation of the new. Against this setting, it
            may be useful to attempt some assessment of where we now stand in our relations with the
            Germans and what we may expect when political activity resumes in September.</p>
                    <p>2. It is realistic, I believe, to describe the present German state of mind with
            respect to the United States as clearly unhealthy. We are not experiencing one of those
            sharp crises of confidence in which there was always an element of the synthetic. The
            old Chancellor himself helped to generate and stimulate these periodic eruptions by
            leaks, statements to the press and public maneuvering, until at last some point of
            resolution was reached and the whole thing subsided. The present difficulties, I would
            judge, run somewhat deeper, are more widespread than in the past, and reflect in part
            the general sense of change Europe caused by limited détente with the Soviets and
              <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>'s challenge to the post-war
            institutional structure. What we now have in Germany is a nagging <pb n="390" xml:id="pg_390" facs="0420"/>concern about the United States and a fading confidence
            in the clarity of our purposes in Europe, added to a feeling that the Germans are being
            victimized and are being treated by us in a way not consonant with their primary role as
            loyal allies or their future importance to a realization of U.S. policy objectives in
            Europe.</p>
                    <p>3. The term “Pruegelknabe” (whipping boy) is frequently heard when Germans describe
            their current international position. They believe that their behavior in recent years
            has been good, both comparatively and absolutely. They see themselves as having fought
            the good fight in the EEC and for the <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName>
            Round, even in the face of strong pressures from German agricultural interests. In
              <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> they believe that they have done well militarily
            and have generally been at our side on Alliance issues, despite the divisive internal
            effects which too strong a line against the French inevitably brings with it. They feel
            they have done more than any other country officially to support our position in Viet
            Nam. Yet they see themselves singled out and criticized for anticipated, though not yet
            actual, failure to meet an offset which we obtain from no other country; they believe
            their security to be threatened by alleged plans for large-scale American troop
            withdrawals, and are only confused when a denial one day is followed the next day by a
            new and to them more horrendous press report from Washington. At the same time their
            primary national objective of reunification remains as much of a will-o-the-wisp as
            ever, and they see little enthusiasm anywhere to do anything about it. However,
            exaggerated these views may be, this is the way the Germans, with their capacity for
            self-pity, size up the situation.</p>
                    <p>4. It is problematical how widespread such sentiments are. The average German has other
            preoccupations, but we would guess that most politicians, journalists and other molders
            of opinion share them to a greater or lesser degree. The <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> is in a relatively confident mood at present. The <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> and the government, on the other hand, are uncertain, fearful of their
            political future, and therefore extremely sensitive to anything, such as U.S. words or
            actions, which can become the basis of further internal criticism. There is fairly
            reliable evidence that Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>
            himself, harassed as he is on a number of fronts and struggling to maintain control over
            a fluid political situation, is feeling abused and nursing a certain sense of grievance
            over “disappointing” U.S. conduct. Stories reach us that certain of his advisers openly
            express anti-U.S. sentiments, and a general querulousness seems to prevail in evaluating
            U.S. policies.</p>
                    <p>5. Such a psychological atmosphere encourages a number of reactions, all of them
            unfavorable to our interests. It enables the Gaullists to argue that, since the U.S. is
            proving unreliable in Europe, the Germans should come to terms with France at any cost.
            The Chancellor is criticized as a stooge of the United States, who not only does not get
            anything for <pb n="391" xml:id="pg_391" facs="0421"/>Germany, but has his own political
            position undermined by U.S. threats and actions. Hence he must lean over backwards to
            avoid the charge that he is being subservient to the U.S. A few politicians are now
            beginning to go so far as to react irrationally, exclaiming that if the United States is
            going to be so unreasonable, to insist on its offset pound of flesh and to make threats
            of troop withdrawals, despite its own clear security interests in Europe, then let the
            United States get out and let the Europeans look to their own interests.</p>
                    <p>6. There is an essential state of confusion about American intentions during this
            transitional era in Europe, which has been fed in recent months by almost daily and
            frequently conflicting press reports from Washington. During 1966 the Germans have
            received a heavy dose of rumors and reports about American plans for massive troop
            withdrawals, complicated by misunderstandings about the temporary shortfall of 15,000
            troops in the 7th Army, frequent U.S. Senatorial statements about the need to pull our
            troops back from Europe, and the whole complicated issue of the offset which has now
            achieved the dubious role of being the single most upsetting factor in German-American
            relations. This has coincided with American attacks on the quality of the Bundeswehr;
            American criticism of German transactions with the Red Chinese, including a Senate
            resolution; German fears about U.S. intentions on non-proliferation; continuing
            differences over Allied defense strategy which have received much publicity in the
            Federal Republic; the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> crisis precipitated by
            France which has put the German Government under heavy strain; and finally the growing
            conviction that the U.S. is being drawn more and more away from Europe into Asia or into
            a form of neo-isolationism.</p>
                    <p>7. The U.S. is on the receiving end of most uniformly unfavorable press and TV coverage
            of Viet Nam—chiefly from American news sources—which, despite continuing official German
            gestures of support, is bound to damage our reputation. Viet Nam is not, however, an
            essential factor in the present malaise, except in the sense that it is considered to
            have distracted us from our responsibilities in Europe.</p>
                    <p>8. As good a friend of the United States and of our post-war policies as Bundestag
            Deputy <persName corresp="#p_BK6">Kurt Birrenbach</persName> recently called on me to
            air his concerns. He said that he and those who stood for the same things were very
            discouraged. They simply could not understand what the United States was up to. If the
            present trend continued, this group would have no choice but to remain silent in the
            face of the opposition to American policies which would dominate in the Federal
            Republic.</p>
                    <p>9. I do not wish to dramatize a situation which is in no sense out of control.
            Psychological moods in Germany are mercurial, and given a few good breaks this fall,
              <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s confidence could be restored and
            much that now seems black would quickly become gray. However, I do think <pb n="392" xml:id="pg_392" facs="0422"/>we have reached the point where we have to be conscious
            that statements which we make and actions which we take will have magnified causal
            effects within a very troubled atmosphere.</p>
                    <p>10. If this analysis is correct, then a major U.S. objective in the months to come
            should be to restore that feeling of trust and confidence which is basic to the
            achievement of our own policy interests in relations with Germany. The forthcoming
              <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> visit to Washington could play a
            crucial role in this process. The agenda outlined in Bonn 286<note n="2" xml:id="d161fn2">
                            <ref target="#d156">Document 156</ref>.</note> continues to be pertinent. A conscious
            effort will be required on our part to right the situation, for we have little to gain
            and much to lose if we allow the present drift to continue. With such an effort, it
            should be possible to restore German-American relations to a healthier condition without
            which we can scarcely face confidently those developments in Europe which the next few
            years are likely to bring.<note n="3" xml:id="d161fn3">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> endorsed the analysis in this message in

                    <p>“Dear Mr. Chancellor:</p>
                    <p>This is just a note to thank you for your full account of your conversation with
            General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> in Bonn.<note n="2" xml:id="d162fn2">See <ref target="frus1964-68v13#d194">

                    <p>I am looking forward to our meeting in September. We can then discuss in full the
            problems raised for us both by the General, as well as the other questions of joint
            concern, some of which were touched on in your letter of July 5.<note n="3" xml:id="d162fn3">

                    <p>In the meanwhile, I should like to make only one point—about the difficult question of
            offset.</p>
                    <p>I know that you and I are agreed that the current offset agreement will be fully met
            and provided for in your new budget and legislative program. The problem of forces,
            deployments—and the sharing of the foreign exchange burden—after the middle of next
            year, raises more difficult questions. We shall have to work hard to find a solution
            that will be both equitable and fully meet the defense requirements of the Alliance.</p>
                    <p>To this end, I would propose that the United States join the Federal Republic and the
            United Kingdom in an initial exploration of these matters during the next several weeks.
            I would hope that the discussions could involve our ministers of finance, as well as of
            foreign affairs and defense. Such triprartite exploration could then be followed by
            thorough consultation with all our allies in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>I very much hope that this proposal will be agreeable to you and to Prime Minister
              <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName>—and that, until we have come to a joint
            conclusion, we can all avoid any budgetary or other decisions which would unduly narrow
            our choices.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> will be in touch with you
            about this proposal in the near future. In the meanwhile, Mr. Chancellor, let me say
            that I think of you often. Your friendship is a source of strength and comfort to me in
            these difficult times.<note n="4" xml:id="d162fn4">In a September 9 reply, <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> suggested that the President's proposals be

                    <p>Dear Mr. Secretary:</p>
                    <p>You will recall our conversation during my recent visit in Washington,<note n="2" xml:id="d163fn2">August 19; no record of the meeting was found.</note> in which I
            mentioned the possibility of our suggesting quite informally to the Germans a course of
            action which might serve to better their international standing and, in particular,
            their relations with the Eastern European countries and the Soviet Union. Since my
            return to Bonn, I have concluded that the present would not be a propitious time to
            suggest this to the Germans. The Government already feels that a number of things it
            believes we are doing puts it under inordinate pressure or threatens its interests, and
            I see little to be gained now by further loading the scale. You will have noted the
            reference to the Oder-Neisse in the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> report cited in
            Bonn 2281.<note n="3" xml:id="d163fn3">Dated August 24. (Department of State, Central
              Files, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 7 FR)</note> We can, however, be thinking
            about how we would formulate an approach when a more favorable time comes.</p>
                    <p>There are in my judgment four major issues which create problems for the Germans beyond
            any corresponding advantages. These are:</p>
                    <p>A. Their official positon on the Oder-Neisse as the ultimate eastern boundary of
            Germany;</p>
                    <p>B. The apparent German desire to increase their influence in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nuclear matters;</p>
                    <p>C. Their rather ambiguous claims to Heimatrecht;</p>
                    <p>D. Their reluctance to declare the Munich Agreement void ab initio.</p>
                    <p>In each case the German position is basically a tactical one—i.e., that a concession
            should be made only when it will provide bargaining power toward the attainment of
            reunification. In all four cases the Germans really have little hope of realizing any
            tangible gain, since in each case they seek to bargain something they do not have and
            which the Bloc states consider a fait accompli. In my judgment there is in fact no
            bargaining power inherent in the German position on these questions; however, the view
            is almost universally held in Germany, particularly by political leaders, that they must
            not “give up something for nothing.” There is a tendency also to fall back on the
            sterile position of the Potsdam Agreement, to the effect that a determination of the
            ultimate boundaries of Germany cannot be made except in connection with a peace treaty
            following reunification.</p>
                    <pb n="395" xml:id="pg_395" facs="0425"/>
                    <p>In my judgment the Germans would not be giving up anything in stating unilaterally that
            they would, if and when reunification comes about:</p>
                    <p>A. Accept the Oder-Neisse boundary, with minor modifications, as their eastern
            frontier;</p>
                    <p>B. Renounce not only the manufacturing, as they have, but also the national possession
            of nuclear weapons;</p>
                    <p>C. State that any exercise of Heimatrecht would be only in full agreement with the
            governments concerned, and</p>
                    <p>D. State that the Munich Agreement was void ab initio.</p>
                    <p>Such an action, accompanied by a repetition of their offer made in their Peace Note of
            March 25, 1966 to exchange declarations with the Eastern European countries renouncing
            the use of force and perhaps even an offer to initiate diplomatic relations would, I
            believe, without any loss to themselves, greatly enhance their image in the world and
            make possible an era of better relations with the states of Eastern Europe. German
            failure to clarify these issues in the past has had the effect of sowing distrust in
            Eastern Europe, as well as in the Soviet Union, as to their ultimate intentions. They
            are, in pursuing their present policy, really forcing the Eastern European states into a
            continuing reliance on the Soviet Union to protect them from a “revanchist and
            militaristic” Germany.</p>
                    <p>There are no Germans east of the Oder-Neisse line. Germany does not need Lebensraum—it
            has a deficit in workers. There is no ally of Germany who would back her in obtaining
            territory beyond the Oder-Neisse line through threats or use of force. Indeed, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> has already given it up publicly and we have
            made it clear privately that we could not back the Germans in any extensive demands. A
            renunciation by Germany would produce an immediate improvement in their relations with
            Poland, which because of this issue are worse than those with any other Eastern European
            country.</p>
                    <p>Germany stands little hope of being a part of a multilaterally-owned nuclear force and,
            in my judgment, no hope at all of ever obtaining a national force. This is not because,
            over a period of time and with sufficient expenditure of funds Germany could not do it
            from a technical standpoint, but because neither the Soviets—or her allies including us,
            would permit her to do it. By the nature of the problem Germany would face in attempting
            to acquire a national nuclear capability, her course of action would be fully revealed
            to the world over the years required for its accomplishment. We could not permit
            it—i.e., we would withdraw our forces and support for Germany first. The other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies would not tolterate it—i.e., they would probably
            move to dissociate themselves from Germany in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.
            The Soviet Union would be quite likely to make such efforts the subject of a preemptive
            attack.</p>
                    <p>Heimatrecht is a very vague right, not clearly established under international law.
            From a practical standpoint it is unlikely that many Germans, <pb n="396" xml:id="pg_396" facs="0426"/>all of whom are now well settled, would ever care to
            return to a hostile communist country. This could in any event not be accomplished
            except through agreement of the countries concerned—i.e., nobody would support Germany
            in accomplishing it otherwise. Heimatrecht when associated as it often is by Germans
            with self-determination is, moreover, patently unacceptable to everyone, since it
            amounts in essence to creeping aggression. The disadvantages to the Germans of total
            renunciation of the Munich Pact are more theoretical than real and could be compensated
            for by corresponding assurances on the part of Czechoslovakia that they would not take
            any of the actions feared by the Germans against former Sudeten-German residents should
            they ever re-enter Czechoslovakia.</p>
                    <p>Without really giving up anything, Germany could through such a declaration drastically
            improve her posture vis-à-vis the international community. The German “policy of
            movement” with respect to Eastern Europe would be greatly facilitated as well as her
            relations with her European neighbors, who still harbor fears and suspicions of a
            nationalist revival in Germany. The way could be cleared for a non-proliferation
            agreement and perhaps even for a broader détente or thin-out in Central Europe. The
              <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> Government could perhaps overcome
            criticism within Germany from such an action by pointing out the much greater gains to
            Germany. We could help by assuring the Chancellor that we would applaud such an action
            in the strongest terms, and would seek to assure that Great Britain and others would
            follow suit.</p>
                    <p>These would be the possible elements of an eventual approach to Schroeder and <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName>. If we pick the right moment, I do not believe we
            would run any great risks in making such suggestions informally. There will have to be
            some clearing up of the present malaise, however, before that right moment arrives.<note n="4" xml:id="d163fn4">In a September 7 letter to <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> wrote: “I agree with

            Reunification to <gloss target="#t_POLAD1">POLAD</gloss> Meeting on East/West
            Relations.</p>
                    <p>1. Before formulating U.S. submission to <gloss target="#t_POLAD1">POLAD</gloss>
            meeting, we believe it essential to discuss approach to reunification question with
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> for German reactions and ideas on how matter
            should be handled.</p>
                    <p>2. Embassy Bonn is requested, therefore, to raise this matter with <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss>. Embassy should say that we believe that major
            Western initiatives on reunification at this time do not offer any more hope of moving
            Soviet Union than in the past. This notwithstanding, we remain firmly committed to
            reunification as major goal of our policy and we are prepared to consider any
            initiatives that Germans themselves believe might have useful results. Furthermore, we
            support Western initiatives in fields other than German reunification in hope and belief
            that these may eventually create climate in which prospects for reunification might be
            improved. In that connection we believe the German policy of seeking improvement in
            relations between <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and Eastern Europe makes a
            significant contribution to the gradual change we seek. We are prepared to support the
            German effort and would welcome suggestions from <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> on
            ways in whch we can assist.</p>
                    <p>3. In light of above, we would appreciate German views on best approach to be taken in
            the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> context. Depending on German reaction, we are
            not inclined to include specific initiatives on reunification during <gloss target="#t_POLAD1">POLAD</gloss> meeting but would be prepared to consider other
            German proposals and support those which offer possibilities of furthering our policy
            objectives.</p>
                    <p>4. In view of time element involved, we would appreciate early report on German views
            concerning how reunification should be approached at Paris meeting.<note n="2" xml:id="d164fn2">The Embassy replied in telegram 2856 from Bonn, September 7.

                        <gloss target="#t_LBJ1">LBJ</gloss>: This thing y'all did yesterday really murdered us
            on <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.<note n="2" xml:id="d165fn2">On August 31,
              Senator Mike Mansfield (D.-Wyo.) together with 12 other Senators offered a non-binding
              resolution (S. Res. 300) based on Senate Democratic Policy Committee recommendations
              that included unspecified cuts in the size of U.S. forces in Europe. For text of the
              resolution, see <hi rend="italic">The New York Times</hi>, September 4, 1966.
              President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> commented on the resolution
              at his September 8 press conference; see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the
                Presidents of the United States: <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B.
                  Johnson</persName>, 1966</hi>, Book II, pp. 998–999. The resolution did not come
              to a vote.</note> I want to give you the views. I don't want to change your views
            because I know how you felt since you were born about this thing, but this playing
            President up there with these statements wthout my knowing it really gets me in a hell
            of a shape.</p>
                    <p>And let me tell you the facts. I hadn't finished analyzing <persName corresp="#p_FJW2">Fulbright</persName>'s program in Thailand and <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName>'s suggestions on <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName> as commander in chief until this damn thing hit me in the face and
            nobody had ever even mentioned it to me. You've got to call me and let me know sometime
            that they are getting ready to be commander in chief for an hour or so.</p>
                    <p>Now here is what we've done now. I've just had a war with the British for two weeks now
            asking them, “Please don't open your mouth until you can sit down and talk to us,”
            because they have got to make reductions with their problems there. But I want to put
            them to where we make reductions when they do, and we take it into account what the
            French are doing, and that we satisfy the Germans that we are just not pulling out
            completely so they don't either start a complete rearmament or blow up. And that poor
            devil that is supporting us and is buying enough here to permit me to keep my people
            there, he's down in the polls now to 30 percent because he's just having every—Bobby
            Kennedy and the world after him over there. They're just chewing him to pieces and
            saying that he's a satellite of <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon Johnson</persName>'s
            and he's giving these Dutchmen money over here and that they don't need to do it, and so
            on and so forth. And I've said to him, “Now you come over here and don't you do
            anything—you've got to keep your commitment to me to reimburse me for every dime I
            spend.”</p>
                    <p>Now, all at that time, I had Rusk notify the Russians that, “Would you be interested in
            reducing some of your 22 divisions if we would <pb n="399" xml:id="pg_399" facs="0429"/>make a corresponding reduction in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>?” And they
            came back with a little indication—no commitment—emphasize, no commitment. But we got a
            response, a little feeler, that we thought was good.</p>
                    <p>So we set up to send a special mission to see the British and to try to have <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">John McCloy</persName>—he's out of town, but he was Commissioner in
            Germany and he has the confidence of all the German factions. And he's on vacation in
            Canada. So I sent a special messenger to him to get him to talk to the Germans, to try
            to get him back from vacation, preparatory to <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>
            saying to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, when he comes to the United
            Nations, that if you consider removing some of your 22 divisions, we'll consider
            removing some of ours. And by God, right in the middle of it, so far as I can see
            without doing a bit of good to anybody, we've got every Democratic leader in the Senate,
            all 13 of them, to serve notice on the President that, by God, they ought to reduce.
            Now, I'm just an old <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> City boy, but when
            I'm playing bridge and I show the other fellow my whole hand, I can't make a very good
            deal with him. And I wish that on these international things that have such terrible
            consequences, where you are committing me to meet with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName> it puts me in a hell of an embarrassing position—I know you can't do
            anything about it. I'm just illustrating to you, though, my position—and where we are
            using Thailand bases<note n="3" xml:id="d165fn3">
                            <hi rend="italic">The New York Times</hi> reported in its September 1 editions that
              Senator <persName corresp="#p_FJW2">Fulbright</persName> would call hearings on
              September 19 to study the presence of thousands of U.S. soldiers in Thailand. In
              making his announcement, <persName corresp="#p_FJW2">Fulbright</persName> had
              described base locations and operational activities of these forces.</note> or if we
            don't, we're going to have to send them from Okinawa or Guam or something. And they are
            exposing those, with the committee wanting to have hearings there. And <persName>John
              Stennis</persName> is running a sideshow over there saying to the world that we are so
            goddamned weak, we can't do anything and making them all think that if they just hold
            out a little longer, these goddamned vultures will eat me up here in this country and
            won't let me stand. He's got <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> on television.
            And then, by God, the fourth thing, for the Policy Committee to hit me. I don't know
            what kind of organization we got in our party. I don't know if we can ever get anybody
            elected. Do you see my point?</p>
                    <p>RL: Well, Mr. President, let me just talk for 20 seconds. These boys had <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> up here. They had <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> up here. They had <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName>
            up here and they talked to them at great length. And frankly, those fellows just made a
            pitiful case. Now, we boys down here have no business hauling the President before our
            Policy Committee to cross-examine him. If you want to talk to us, why, of course, any
            time you want to send for us, we'll come down there, but—</p>
                    <p>LBJ: I never heard of the Policy … I never heard of this. This is the first time I ever
            heard of the Democratic Policy Committee, by God, getting in to being commander in
            chief. I thought it was a scheduling committee, and I never looked upon it, and I served
            on it a long time.</p>
                    <pb n="400" xml:id="pg_400" facs="0430"/>
                    <p>Now, <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> wrote me this letter. Now I get
            these proposals from him. Now I wish he could be Secretary of State for a while. But
            I've read 800 suggestions and I've never found eight of them worth a—very much. But I
            read them and I study them and I look at them every damn day. I've had three this week.
            I've got Thailand on the cooker with <persName corresp="#p_FJW2">Fulbright</persName>.
            I've got the <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> big meeting. I wish he
            would let me run my own schedule. But, and then I've got this one here.</p>
                    <p>But the moment I got his letter, I picked up the phone and called <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
            and got them in and said, “Now, <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> is
            playing Secretary of State. Will y'all get up there right quick and will you tell him
            two or three things. First, this is desperately unwise. So let's just let him know it's
            unwise. It doesn't contribute a thing to the United States. It's almost a shot in the
            back of some goddamned boy because it divides us. That's the first thing. It's unwise.
            The second thing is that whatever we do, we've got to do collectively. We want to talk
            to these other people. And we've got to let them know if they pull out, we're going to
            pull out. And we've also got to let the enemy know that if we pull down, he ought to
            pull down. So let them know that, number two. Then, number three, finally, let them know
            that we have these things underway now working feverishly. We're trying to see how many
            of these folks we can bring home. We're trying to see how many we can get the Germans to
            add to it. And we're trying to see what the French are ultimately going to do. We're
            trying to see whether the British have really got to pull down 15,000 or whether they
            can move them across the line into Britain and still do the same thing. And let them
            know that this is not going to be handled in <hi rend="italic">The New York Times</hi>! And a goddamned sense
            of Congress resolution ain't worth a shit unless this President has some respect for the
            sense of it. And all it can do is notify every enemy that we're just a bunch of
            un-unified folks running off like Bert Wheeler, and Jeanette Rankin, in every goddamned
            direction!”</p>
                    <p>So they went and did that, and they came back and reported to me. I don't know if you
            were at the meeting or not. But they reported to me that the committee understood that,
            and that they said that no action was going to be taken. They'd just hold it, in the
            light of what they told them, where it was. So yesterday morning when I got word from a
            Republican—I'm sorry to say that there wasn't one Democratic Senator of the 13 that
            would tell their own President what to do—they called me and said, “We think this is
            disastrous here, and what are you going to do about it?” I said, “I've never heard of
            it.” So they said, “Well, they're getting ready to file it at 10:30.”</p>
                    <p>I immediately called <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and said, “<persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>, will you get a hold of <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName>? Tell him not that you want to talk to him on the phone. Tell
            him you want to come see him. And you get up there and tell him that you've got
            conferences scheduled this month with the Russians on a <pb n="401" xml:id="pg_401" facs="0431"/>trade-out deal where they will remove some of their 22 divisions so let's
            don't say what we ought to do until we can kind of trade with them. That's one. Show him
            the cables I sent to <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> from the Ranch last
              Friday.<note n="4" xml:id="d165fn4">See <ref target="frus1964-68v13#d198">
                                <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1964–1968, vol. XIII, Document
              198</ref>.</note> Tell him not to leak it, but show it to him,” and so forth.</p>
                    <p>Then I called <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and I said, “I know Dick
            Russell's got too much sense for this. I just know he's always wanting to be out of
            there and he's really an isolationist at heart, just 100 percent so far as this group is
            concerned. Always has been. Was when I was the Leader. But I know he's got too much
            sense when this is going on to take the ball. So <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, you go see <persName corresp="#p_RRB1">Russell</persName>. And
            then <persName corresp="#p_SWS2">Symington</persName>'s gone crazy on balance of
            payments. He's just a nut on the question and get a hold of him.”</p>
                    <p>So <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> called me back and said, “<persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> said he doesn't want to see me. He's already
            made up his mind.They're already going to do it. No reason. I told him that I'd
            understood that he told me he wasn't. Why, he told me, ‘That wouldn't make any
            difference, we have.’”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> called me back and said, “<persName corresp="#p_RRB1">Russell</persName> agrees that we oughtn't to be taking it up in the
            light of these things, but he says they got to file it but he'll try to do what he can
            to keep them from acting on it.” Then <persName corresp="#p_SWS2">Symington</persName>
            called back and said, no, he wants to be Secretary of the Treasury for a day or two and
            play with it and, under this theory of balance of payments, this is really going to save
            us a hell of a lot of money. Now it may next year, could affect the balance of payments.
            This year we got a firm sign-on from them, and unless they weasel out of it, which we
            are afraid the Germans might make <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> do, we
            are going to get every damn dollar we spend. But we're going to have to modify it by
            letting them buy a little space equipment and something besides strictly military—</p>
                    <p>RL: Mr. President, assuming you are right about this, I just hate to say it, but
            assuming you are right, your Cabinet boys and your executive boys just did a very poor
            job in getting your side of the argument—</p>
                    <p>LBJ: May do it …</p>
                    <p>RL:—across.</p>
                    <p>LBJ: May do it. But I think that <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and
              <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> are both reasonably articulate. But
            it may be that and just, in this instance—but hell, I can't help it. But you see the
            problem one man has got in trying to run it. And I think we ought to really understand
            that if they've lost confidence in me and they don't want me to handle Thailand—and I
            think it's just awful for us to be going through the excruciating experiences on
            television, talking about the weaknesses of our forces and the strengths. And Strom
            Thurmond and <persName>John Stennis</persName>, and then Bill Fulbright handing them
            down the other day, trying to browbeat them on Thailand. And <pb n="402" xml:id="pg_402" facs="0432"/>then the Democratic committee hitting us here on what we are doing on
              <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. I just think they ought to get their views
            [Sanitized—Donor's Deed of Gift] come down here and talk to me but, by God, don't do it
            in the papers! Don't, don't shoot me in the back. It's worse than old <persName corresp="#p_ADG2">Acheson</persName> going over in a conference to the Foreign

              Session. (Washington, 1966)</note> meeting before, because it sure don't help the
            country. And I just got to have you or somebody to kind of give a little leadership.</p>
                    <p>The first place, if I wanted to reform things and get some action, I'd start in the
            United States Senate, instead of working on the Executive. Because I think that I'm
            ready to receive their views, to listen to them, to evaluate them, to carefully consider
            them and so forth. But I don't see that they did a bit of good by these damn—introducing
            the resolutions and speech. I don't believe it will be. And anyway, if they do do it, it
            ought to be after we both understand it. And then I can tell <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> I can't control my folks. They want to go out and make this pitch.
            I'm not going to pay a damn bit of attention to it. But you go on. And I can tell the
            Russians that I'm not in the position to make any agreements and I'm helpless. But I
            want you to really give a little thought to it and try to put yourself in … The
            Constitution, I think, makes one thing clear, that the Commander in Chief is the
            President, and these things, he can't fight a war from Thailand bases and explain to the
            Soviet Union every day why he's doing it.</p>
                    <p>RL: Well, as far as the Thailand thing is concerned, I'm 100 percent with you. And with
            regard to this part of it, Mr. President, to be fair to us, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> told this group down here that in his judgment that the fact that
            the______was raising hell about the fact that these other guys had not delivered on
            their commitment, that not a single country over there has done what they had promised
            to do, would in some respects help him to get better cooperation from those people. And
            frankly, that's one point that they discussed several times. Now, as far as coming to
            you about the thing, their thought was, “Well, should we go tell the President,” and the
            reaction of every man there except one was to say “Well gee, if you go tell the
            President, he's going to say don't do it, And then if you do it, he's going to feel that
            you just went out and just deliberately kicked him and—”</p>
                    <p>LBJ: What do you think I think now?</p>
                    <p>RL:—[inaudible] here's what we think about matters and—</p>
                    <p>LBJ: They told me what they thought in that damn, long-winded letter, three or four
            pages. I know what they thought. And what do you think I thought about it when everybody
            in the world says that the Committee unanimously—anyway you see my viewpoint, you see my
            problem, <pb n="403" xml:id="pg_403" facs="0433"/>and I know you love me and I know your
            views and I know we differ. If we didn't, we'd want the same wife and we'd all want to
            live in the same place. Of course, we're going to have opinions. I just want you to be
            my floor leader and kind of understand that I've got to have a little bit of help up
            there, and I went out and picked <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> a good
            many years ago to be Whip to try to balance the party problems there. And I know that he
            feels that he can't really be very … Well, anyway, you saw your daddy Governor and you
            saw his floor leaders and you know what a President's got to have. And I don't know who
            my leaders are. I don't know how in the hell I can get any help. I don't know who is
            defending me. I know that I like every man in the Senate, and I want to work with them
            and I want to help them. But these sense resolutions, I don't believe are going to
            change the course of things very much and I'm more anxious than any man on that goddamn
            committee on balance of payments to get troops out. But I sure as hell don't want to get
            them out with 22 divisions there and kick off World War III. And every damn man on that
            resolution will run and hide, by God, when you say “You kicked this thing off, you
            pulled a goddamned Chamberlain and you ran out and said you were going to pull out,
            you're not interested in it anymore. You refused to fortify Guam or you refused to do
            this.” And I know what is happening. I'm not one of these folks that's just sucked in by
            the Russians. I don't believe in the <persName corresp="#p_FJW2">Fulbright</persName>,
              <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_SWS2">Symington</persName> whole goddamned theory, that it's all over over there. I don't
            think so at all. I think those sons of bitches want to eat us any day they can. And I
            think the biggest notice you can do is just say “Uncle Sam is tired and wants to come
            home. We're going to follow <persName>John Stennis</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FJW2">Fulbright</persName>.” And I think those sons of bitches will do
            worse than what Hitler did. I may be wrong …</p>
                    <p>RL: Mr. President, what I'd suggest you do, and I think it would be best not to do it
            today or tomorrow, but sometime during the next week or so, I think it would be good, if
            not the whole bunch, get about six or eight of those fellows who are on that group down
            there, and give them your views on it and I think that will quiet things down.</p>
                    <p>LBJ: All right, I'll do that. And you kind of give me quietly, without telling another
            human, because you know the envies and jealousies in this city. If anybody sees I'm even
            speaking to you, why they think I'm undermining them or affecting their prestige or
            running under the Pope or something. But you give me the group that you think it would
            be wise to talk to, whether it would be, who would speak up, whether it would be
            Pastore, or whether it would be Muskie, or whether it would be <persName corresp="#p_RRB1">Russell</persName>—</p>
                    <p>RL: I don't think it would serve much point to talk to Dick Russell. His views are so,
            have been fixed for so long. And he, incidentally, had no interest in taking the
            leadership in this matter either.</p>
                    <pb n="404" xml:id="pg_404" facs="0434"/>
                    <p>LBJ: He told <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> that he agreed it wasn't
            going to do any good, that he wanted them out and he believed they ought to come out.
            But he didn't think we ought to be doing this while we're trying to negotiate ourselves
            out. See, we all agree with the general purpose. There is no argument about that. We
            would like ourselves to get as many as we could out. I tried to get them out of Korea.
            First thing I did when I came to be President, I said two things I'm going to do: to
            bring some folks home from <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and bring some home
            from Korea or make them put up. Well, when I started looking, suppose I pulled them out
            of Korea, I couldn't have the Korean divisions over there and that would be an
            invitation to show we're weaker there. And if I pulled them from <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, I might let the Russians start. <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName>, by God, showed a little weakness in Vienna. And
              <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> said “Well, we'll just move on you
            this year.” So then he had to send me to Germany and he had to march his troops through
            the gates. He had to cross the Wall and he had to call up all of the reserves. I don't
            want to have to do that. Because, show a little weakness, and if those sons of bitches
            think you're weak, they're like a country dog—you stand still, they'll chew you to
            death, if you run, they'll eat your ass out. And I'm dealing with them every day. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] And I just don't
            believe that <persName>John Stennis</persName>' staff and Stu Symington, I just, I don't
            want … Well anyway, they haven't got the job. Now, if they want me to turn it over to
              <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName> or they want Bobby Kennedy to run it,
            why that's something else in '68. But I sure as hell, during this period, don't want to
            get us in World War III. And I can't think of a better way in the world to get us in it
            right now than to let the Chinese think we won't fight in Asia, and let the Russians
            think we won't fight in Europe, and that they can do what Hitler thought he could do. We
            just can't let them think that. And that's why I had to say yesterday that this is not
            United States Government policy at all. And I said to every goddamned Embassy, I just
            said, now Woodrow Wilson had his Senators, Roosevelt had his Wheeler's, and I've got
            some talking, too. But don't you think for a goddamned minute I'm moving one man. Now
            they can cut off the appropriations and they can do anything they want to do. But I
            goddamn sure am not going to say to the Russians at this stage of the game, when the
            North Vietnamese are sitting there talking to them now, at this minute, trying to make
            up their plans what they are going to do in Asia, that, by God, I'm going to cede them
            Europe by default and come home.</p>
                    <p>So you think about what I've said, you consider it and then you kind of give me a
            little advice, even if you have to oppose me.</p>
                    <p>RL: I guess I'll do that.</p>
                    <p>LBJ: God bless you.</p>
                    <p>RL: Thank you.</p>

                    <p>2698. Subj: Conversation with <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>.</p>
                    <p>1. I had a meeting with Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> today
            which he expressed at length his views on world affairs along familiar lines. I raised
            certain points which emerged in some of his recent interviews and invited his comments
            on the domestic situation.</p>
                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> immediately launched into an
            exposition of the Soviet threat and what the West should do about it. His starting point
            was the proposed Senate resolution of the Democratic Policy Committee. I drew his
            attention to the comments by the White House spokesman on this resolution and assured
            him that we had no intention to withdraw major combat units.<note n="2" xml:id="d166fn2">See <ref target="#d166fn2">footnotes 2</ref> and <ref target="#d165fn3">3, Document
                165</ref>.</note> The substance of <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>'s
            exposition was that the Soviet military threat toward West Europe had not diminished. It
            was imperative for the West to maintain an effective military posture in Western Europe.
            Although he felt that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> was generally
            correct in his criticism of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> organization, he
            regretted that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> had taken France out of
            that organization. The Soviets were confronted with three major tasks: to build up their
            military forces in competition with the US, to tackle major problems of domestic
            economic development, and to ready themselves for the Chinese threat. The Soviets could
            not accomplish all these tasks simultaneously, but would have to choose. It was in the
            interest of the West to steer the Soviets in a direction whereby they would concentrate
            on domestic development and the Chinese threat. in order to do so, the West must not
            lower its guard in Europe. A major US troop withdrawal would lead the Soviets to believe
            that Western defenses are crumbling and encourage them to adopt an offensive posture in
            Europe. The West, on the other hand, should not itself adopt a threatening posture
            vis-à-vis the Soviets as this, in turn, would lead the Soviets to concentrate their
            efforts in Europe. The proper Western posture in Europe was one of patient waiting while
            maintaining current defense levels. This would offer the best chance that the Soviets
            would divert their attention from Europe to their own domestic problems and to the
            threat posed by Communist China and the Far East. They would realize that Europe offered
            no threat to them but that Communist China did.</p>
                    <p>3. I pointed out that our govt fully shared the view that a Soviet threat remained
            serious. It seemed, however, that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> held
            a different <pb n="406" xml:id="pg_406" facs="0436"/>view. <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> said that he would gladly talk to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName> about this. He was confident that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName> would be in basic agreement with his analysis. He said <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> shared his belief that the fates of Germany and
            France were closely interwoven. If Germany fell prey to the Soviets, France would be
            next. French interest rather than a desire to be kind to Germany was the reason for
              <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>'s defense of the German case during
            his recent Moscow visit. <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> recalled a
            meeting with Eisenhower, Macmillan and <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>
            during which there had been a frank discussion of the German problem. While Eisenhower
            and Macmillan had been somewhat cautious, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName> had taken the position that he desired reunification because he did
            not wish to see Soviet troops on the Rhine.</p>
                    <p>4. I mentioned the interview which <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> had
            given to Sulzberger on August 10 in which he had said that we should withdraw from Viet
              Nam.<note n="3" xml:id="d166fn3">The interview took place on August 2. For
              Sulzberger's account, see <hi rend="italic">Age of Mediocrity</hi>, pp.
              278–282.</note> I pointed out that in our opinion such a withdrawal under present
            conditions would have extremely dangerous consequences and that it might also be
            interpreted by the Soviets as softness and in Europe and elsewhere as unwillingness on
            our part to adhere to our commitments. I also said that we appreciated his views on this
            as well as on any other problem but that we hoped he would give them to us directly
            rather than through the press. <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> said he
            wanted to explain his position to me very frankly. He had not asked for the interview
            but he had welcomed it as an opportunity to draw attention to a situation which he felt
            was very serious. What he really feared was that the question of US obligations and
            commitments might become a serious issue in the US Presidential campaign. He had given
            the interview in the hope of provoking a statement from us reiterating the firmness of
            our commitment in Europe.</p>
                    <p>5. Commenting on the current crisis in the Defense Ministry <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> said that in his opinion <persName corresp="#p_HKU1">Von
              Hassel</persName> must go. He thought this would happen fairly soon. A structural
            reform of the Defense Ministry was also necessary—the tasks were too vast for one man to
            handle. He said no decision had as yet been reached whether to appoint an additional
            Minister or Political State Secretary to the Defense Ministry, or whether to transfer
            some of the Defense Ministry's responsibilities to another Ministry.</p>
                    <p>6. I asked <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> for his views on the current
            prospects of the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>. He said the situation was very
            bad. The voters were clearly dissatisfied with the present govt. The problem was that
            under the German Constitution a Chancellor was practically irremovable. Also, <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> leaders had been dispersed during the summer months and
            had made separate uncoordinated statements. Nevertheless, unless the direction and style
            of operation of the govt underwent a rapid change, the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> would <pb n="407" xml:id="pg_407" facs="0437"/>surely lose the next
            Federal elections. He said that he was greatly concerned about the declining health of
              <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> leaders <persName corresp="#p_EF4">Erler</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_WH6">Wehner</persName>. If they
            disappeared, the left wing—those who had, among other things, advocated the speakers
            exchange with the <gloss target="#t_SED1">SED</gloss> which he continued to regard as a
            serious mistake—would take over. A dangerous situation would arise in Europe if France,
            after <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>, had a popular front govt and
            Germany an <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> govt under left-wing leadership. I asked
              <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> what kind of a change of direction he
            considered necessary. He said “The government must resume the course which I pursued as
            Chancellor. Coming from me, this may sound vain; but it is not immodest if I consider
            myself a bit more intelligent than certain others who are very stupid.”</p>
                    <p>Comment: <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> looked pallid on the eve of his
            departure for a vacation at Caddenabia. However he was alert and in good spirits. I have
            reported his views on global problems in some detail even though they represent little
            that is new. I was told today by Kingsbury Smith of Hearst that the Chancellor expressed
            similar views in an interview with him which he will be reporting. <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>'s comments on domestic matters reflect his
            undiminished disdain for <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> as Chancellor,
            also <persName corresp="#p_HKU1">Von Hassel</persName> as Def Min. <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> has recently been heard recommending Gerstenmaier
            as <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s successor. It is obvious that he
            hopes that a combination of <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> leaders can soon be put
            together which could tackle the problem of <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s succession.</p>

              lines of source text not declassified</hi>]</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Begin report:</p>
                    <p>In an off-the-record press conference held in Bonn on September 8, Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Ludwig Erhard</persName> told a small group of selected West
            German and West Berlin journalists that he does not anticipate that the agenda for his
            forthcoming visit to Washington will “provide enough time” for a discussion of German
            involvement in a possible future <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. In any event, said
            the Chancellor, the West Germans would be willing to discuss such a force only if the
            concept were completely different from any that has thus far been advanced. In the
            meantime, Bonn will press its case for a fight to defend German soil against atomic
            attacks by an appeal to “international public opinion.”</p>
                    <p>When a further discussion of West German involvement in the Western defense strategy
            centered upon the matter of offset payments, <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> evinced a degree of firmness bordering on the belligerent. He
            conceded that it behooves the Germans to appreciate the balance of payments problems
            with which the U.S. is confronted. Nonetheless, he said, U.S. Defense Secretary
              <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s “demands” in the area of offset
            payments are “completely arbitrary” and must be categorically rejected. Asked whether he
            would display this attitude during his forthcoming visit to Washington, the Chancellor
            replied emphatically—“You can bet on that.”</p>
                    <p>(<hi rend="italic">Source comment:</hi> Although it was clearly understood by all the
            participants that the Chancellor was not to be quoted, <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> went to great pains to re-emphasize this point on several occasions
            during the course of the press conference.)</p>

                    <p>3362. Subject: General <persName corresp="#p_KD4">Klein</persName> on <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s current mood.</p>
                    <p>1. General Julius Klein, who is currently visiting in Germany and apparently still has
            close contacts with the Chancellor and his personal assistant <persName corresp="#p_HK3">Hohmann</persName> (he says he has seen <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> three times in the past week), has provided us with an account of
            his various conversations.</p>
                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_KD4">Klein</persName> reported that never before had he seen
            the Chancellor in such a shaken condition. He is fighting for his political life, and
            knows that many of his party colleagues are sharpening their knives to take advantage of
            the first opportunity to finish him off. During his initial meeting with <persName corresp="#p_KD4">Klein</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>
            seemed scared stiff at the prospect of his impending visit to the United States. He
            asked <persName corresp="#p_KD4">Klein</persName> what the reaction would be in the
            United States if he were suddenly to develop a diplomatic illness causing cancellation
            of the trip. <persName corresp="#p_KD4">Klein</persName> said he responded that no one
            would believe this, and that he would be finished both in the United States and in
            Germany. The Chancellor commented this was exactly the way he felt. <persName corresp="#p_KD4">Klein</persName> said the Chancellor had undoubtedly been receiving
            advice that he should call off the trip from a number of <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> politicians, and probably also from Westrick.<note n="2" xml:id="d168fn2">
                            <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> discussed the background to the
                <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> visit in <hi rend="italic">At the
                Creation of a New Germany</hi>, pp. 188–189.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_KD4">Klein</persName> observed that the Chancellor had asked
            him a number of questions of a kind which he had never raised before. For example, he
            could not believe that the <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName>
              resolution<note n="3" xml:id="d168fn3">See <ref target="#d165fn2">footnote 2, Document
                165</ref>.</note> had not been put forward without the Executive's secret blessing.
            Despite his difficulties with Barzel, the Chancellor went on, he could not imagine the
              <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> majority leader putting forward a resolution of
            this kind contrary to his own policies. <persName corresp="#p_KD4">Klein</persName> said
            he tried to explain to <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> how our
            legislative system works in relation to the Executive, and he had hoped he had made some
            impression on the Chancellor.</p>
                    <p>4. In their two subsequent conversations, according to <persName corresp="#p_KD4">Klein</persName>, the Chancellor had seemed slightly more relaxed about the prospects
            for his Washington visit but was still very much a harassed and anxious man. The
            majority of his advisers are still counselling calling the trip off, and if that is not
            possible, are telling him that he must come back with some success or he will be
            politically finished. Since the prospects for a success on the offset are considered
            dim, the only idea which the Chancellor has <pb n="410" xml:id="pg_410" facs="0440"/>so
            far had would be to obtain the consent of the President for a visit here to show his
            interest in Europe.</p>
                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_KD4">Klein</persName> said that the Chancellor was suspicious
            of most of the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> politicians who were giving him
            advice. He was afraid that they would gang up against him even during his short absence
            in the United States, and was trying to gain assurance from party leaders such as Barzel
            that they would sit on the lid during his trip. Pressure was developing to have the
            Chancellor take <persName corresp="#p_WL5">Westrick</persName> along, and <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> at least today seemed to be moving in this
            direction since it would enable him to prove publicly that he and <persName corresp="#p_WL5">Westrick</persName> are still friends despite the latter's
            resignation. On the other hand, it is quite clear, according to <persName corresp="#p_KD4">Klein</persName>, that <persName corresp="#p_WL5">Westrick</persName> would actually be intended to serve as a watchdog over the
            Chancellor in order to make sure that he made no concessions to the President.</p>
                    <p>6. The problem of succession to <persName corresp="#p_WL5">Westrick</persName>
            continues at fever pitch, according to <persName corresp="#p_KD4">Klein</persName>.
            Party leaders are pressing strongly for designation of the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> whip, Will Rasner, as State Secretary, although <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s preference is decidely for <persName corresp="#p_HK3">Hohmann</persName>. If Rasner must enter the Chancellor's office,
            then <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> wants two State Secretaries to be
            designated, one of whom would be <persName corresp="#p_HK3">Hohmann</persName>, but this
            has run into strong resistance.</p>
                    <p>7. In the prevailing atmosphere, <persName corresp="#p_KD4">Klein</persName> believes,
            the Chancellor tends to interpret everything in the light of the immediate effects it
            will have on his personal political position. This will certainly be true of his visit
            to the United States. For this reason, the Chancellor will be in no position to make any
            concessions on such matters as nuclear non-proliferation.</p>
                    <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> While the foregoing may seem highly colored,
            allowing for some possible exaggerations, it probably reflects with reasonable accuracy
            the Chancellor's current mood. The ebbing of his political position has been so rapid,
            and the prospect of restoring it must seem so bleak at this juncture, that he has become
            highly sensitized to the political maneuvering which is normal in Bonn and interprets
            it—probably with some justification—as directed against him personally. Whether his
            supicion of individuals is justified is difficult to say at this point, since the Bonn
            political scene is overheated with rumors and speculation the order of the day.</p>

              <persName corresp="#p_ME4">Mende</persName> consciously limited himself to the area of
            East-West German relations in order not to anticipate the discussions which Chancellor
              <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> is to have in Washington later on in
            the month. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_ME4">Mende</persName> spoke at length about the
            shooting along the Berlin Wall, the arrest of West Germans on the Autobahn to Berlin and
            the failure of West German attempts to improve communications with the East Zone. He
            fears that worse is still to come and expects that the East Zone will require West
            Germans to accept East German visas this coming Christmas. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_ME4">Mende</persName> links the increased aggressiveness of the East Zone
            authorities in part to the war in Viet-Nam. Germany and the U.S. are being attacked
            together as disturbers of the peace. Under questioning from the Secretary, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_ME4">Mende</persName> conceded, however, that the increase in shooting by
            East German border guards is related to an increase in the number of flights from East
            Germany. Furthermore, the Zone authorities are still willing to release prisoners—even
            those serving life terms—for needed commodities such as chemical products, machines,
            drugs and coffee.</p>
                    <pb n="412" xml:id="pg_412" facs="0442"/>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_ME4">Mende</persName> also acknowledged that West Germany's
            difficulties are limited to the East Zone and to a lesser extent to Moscow. Relations
            with East European Soviet satellites have greatly improved. With Rumania relations are
            very good. Those with Hungary and Czechoslovakia are also good in many respects. Those
            with Bulgaria are less satisfactory but still not bad. Poland is more difficult but here
            too on the people-to-people level things are improving. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_ME4">Mende</persName> related that General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName> had even been very optimistic regarding future German relations with
            Soviet Russia during his visit to Bonn. But in his own conversations with <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName>, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_ME4">Mende</persName> had not received any such encouragement.</p>
                    <p>In response to a question from the Secretary, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_ME4">Mende</persName> ventured the opinion <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
            may well raise the question of the continuation of the Spandau prison regime or protest
            the meetings of Bundestag committees in West Berlin in his conversations with the
            Secretary. But even if he doesn't raise the Berlin issue, according to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_ME4">Mende</persName> it would be useful if the Secretary were to ask
              <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> what is going on and why there should
            be so much shooting in Berlin. The Secretary agreed to inform the Germans immediately if
              <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> were to indicate that Moscow intended
            to divert attention from Viet-Nam by focusing on Germany.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_ME4">Mende</persName> also referred to the efforts of the
              <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> regime to obtain representation at the
            U.N. He warned that for the East Germans to get an observer accredited would have an
            enormously disturbing effect upon public opinion in West Germany and elsewhere, since it
            would tend to give equal status to East and West Germany. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_ME4">Mende</persName> explained that in order to combat the efforts by <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> to make himself acceptable at the U.N., the West
            German Government was transmitting individual copies of a documentary report on the
            violation of human rights in East Germany to the ambassadors of all U.N. member
            nations.</p>
                    <p>In response to questions from the Secretary, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_ME4">Mende</persName> also spoke at some length about the increase in the number of
            flights from East Germany over the past few months. According to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_ME4">Mende</persName>, flights have doubled every week since April, and
            the flight attempts have become more dramatic, more desperate, more courageous. Dr.
              <persName corresp="#p_ME4">Mende</persName> attributes this phenomenon less to
            dissatisfaction with physical conditions in the Zone than with the lack of rights and
            freedoms by comparison with neighboring East European countries. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_ME4">Mende</persName> meets every three months with these escapees and has
            offered to make available to the Secretary the reports of these meetings. The Secretary
            stated in reply that he would very much like to see these reports.</p>

                    <p>Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>, in December 1963 and again
            in December 1965, reaffirmed his intention to fulfill the offset arrangement. In 1963,
            the <pb n="414" xml:id="pg_414" facs="0444"/>Communiqué<note n="5" xml:id="d170fn5">For
              text, see <hi rend="italic">Documents on Germany, 1944–1985</hi>, pp. 860–862.</note>
            stated, “The President expressed appreciation for the cooperative arrangement whereby
            United States dollar expenditures for American military forces in Germany are offset by
            German purchases of military equipment in the United States. <hi rend="italic">It was
              agreed that this arrangement should continue.” Last December 21, the joint
              Communiqué</hi>
                        <note n="6" xml:id="d170fn6">For text, see ibid., pp. 910–912.</note> said that you and
            he “discussed the arrangements between the two governments whereby United States
            military expenditures in Germany entering the balance of payments are offset by the
            Federal Republic through its purchase of United States military equipment and services.
              <hi rend="italic">It was agreed that these arrangements were of great value to both
              governments and should be fully executed and continued.”</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The current German commitment is to place $1,350,000,000 of military orders in the US
            in calendar years 1965–1966 and to <hi rend="italic">make payments</hi> of that amount
            in US fiscal years 1966–1967. As of September 1, the orders (with three months to go)
            have reached only $665 million, or less than half of the commitment, and payments (with
            nine months to go) have reached only $261 million, or about 20% of the commitment. A
            September 9 cable from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName>
                        <note n="7" xml:id="d170fn7">Not found.</note> reported that the German Assist-ant
            Secretary for Economic Affairs in the Chancellor's office said “as matters now stand he
            sees no real alternative to a large shortfall in the present offset payments target next
            June 30 and a stretchout of the period in which to meet the target.”</p>
                    <p>It is clear that the difficulty arises from the inadequacy of the German military
            budget. That budget increased annually until 1963. It has leveled off since then.
            Indeed, in real terms (taking account of inflation), the 1967 German military budget is
            almost 10% less than in 1963. Germany now devotes 5% of her Gross National Product to
            defense, compared to 6% in 1963. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> spends 6.8% and
            the US 8.8%. While the Gross National Product of Germany is increasing on an average of
            5% a year, none of the increase is being devoted to military expenditures. The
            Chancellor states that the reason for this allocation of resources is domestic political
            pressures.</p>
                    <p>It should be remembered and understood that the German shortfall in meeting the offset
            is not because Germany has no military requirements to make purchases in the United
            States. US policy has been to ask Germany (1) to do only what she promised to do—namely,
            to meet the offset, (2) to buy only what she needs to bring her forces up to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> standards, and (3) to buy from us only those items
            which it is most economical to purchase in the US. With respect to German requirements
            to meet <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> standards, the German forces are seriously
            deficient. The <pb n="415" xml:id="pg_415" facs="0445"/>Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
            Staff and <gloss target="#t_USCINCEUR1">USCINCEUR</gloss> have concurred in a report
            which indicated some $4 billion in German requirements for initial equipping,
            modernizing and training and for reserve stocks. By way of comparison: The US has a
            division slice of more than 41,000 men in Europe while the Germans have 27,000; the US
            has been maintaining 90 days of war reserve stocks in Europe while the Germans barely
            meet 30 days on some items and considerably less than that in the major equipment area;
            the US is at 100% of equipment levels in all its divisions while the Germans are not
            only less fully equipped, but equipped with less modern arms. Another comparison: The
            United States has 230,000 tons of bombs either in or in transit to Southeast Asia; the
            German Air Force's total inventory amounts to approximately 4400 tons—an obviously
            inadequate amount. If Germany were to procure proper conventional ordnance for her
            aircraft, expenditures on the order of $150 million would be involved for this item
            alone. German statements to the effect that they do not need the military items involved
            in the offset are therefore clearly untrue.</p>
                    <p>Our best estimates are that, unless something is done, there will be a very large gap
            between the foreign exchange costs of US deployments to Germany (an average of
            approximately $850 million a year over the next five years) and German foreign-exchange
            expenditures on the military account in the US (predicted by the Germans to average $350
            million a year). Therefore, unless changes are made, a gap of $500 million a year should
            be expected next year and probably every year thereafter.</p>
                    <p>It would not be wise for the United States to accept this gap as a continuing
            situation.</p>
                    <p>I believe that we should break the problem into two parts. The first part is the
            current offset referred to above; the second part is the follow-on offset
            arrangement.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the current offset, the agreement to place $1,350,000,000 of <hi rend="italic">orders</hi> by the end of December 1966 cannot be fulfilled. <hi rend="italic">Payment</hi>, however, of the $1,350,000,000 by June 1967, in accordance
            with that part of the offset arrangement, <hi rend="italic">could</hi> be made despite
            the reduced budget by German borrowing for prepayment against future orders. This
            approach is not fully satisfactory, but is probably the most we can now ask for. The
            Chancellor almost certainly will object to such an approach, but in my view we should
            push hard for this form of fulfillment of the current offset.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the follow-on offset arrangement, we should:</p>
                    <p>a. Press the Chancellor for a larger defense budget and consequent offset. In view of
            the Chancellor's political problems, the pay-off from this pressure may not be great in
            the next two years, but it may produce returns in the longer run. (In this connection,
            the Chancellor may propose the inclusion in the offset of purchases of space items,
            items destined <pb n="416" xml:id="pg_416" facs="0446"/>for foreign military assistance,
            passenger aircraft for the German airline, and so on. We should accept any items which
            are truly “additional” and not merely a “giving of credit” to Germany for purchases,
            such as the passenger aircraft, which Germany would make here anyway. The total of such
            “additional” items will be very small and therefore almost irrelevant to the basic
            problem.</p>
                    <p>b. Insist on trilateral (US–<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>-Germany) discussions to
            address the question of how the remaining gap will be closed—including arrangements for
            US troop reductions.</p>
                    <p>We must face the fact that the United States can deal with any remaining gap only (1)
            by cutting US military expenditures in Germany or (2) by absorbing the balance of
            payments drain caused by the excess of US expenditures over German offset.</p>
                    <p>I believe we can cut US military expenditures in Europe by about $200 million ($160
            million in Germany) without significantly reducing our military effectiveness. (The
              <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> do not concur.) This $200 million total is reached
            by reducing each division slice by 10,000 support personnel (a total of 50,000 men,
            producing a saving of $125 million); by “dual-basing” approximately half of our 700
            reconnaissance and fighter aircraft (saving $60 million); and by other economies ($15
            million). But a deficit in the vicinity of $300 million is likely to remain. This $300
            million cannot be saved without removing major combat units.</p>
                    <p>Even the $200 million adjustments may have a traumatic psychological impact in Germany,
            in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and in the United States. Adjustments to close
            all of the remaining $300 million gap, by cutting US combat power, would be even more
            traumatic and, in my view, dangerous; but I believe some reductions in US combat power
            will have to be considered if the problem cannot be solved in any other way.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Treasury have received copies of this
            memorandum. The Secretary of the Treasury concurs in it. I believe the Secretary of
            State does also; however, he is planning to supplement this memorandum with a paper
            describing the political pressures which today limit the Chancellor's freedom of
            action.</p>

            September 26–27, seek a “stretch-out” of the existing offset agreement ending on June
            30, 1967, and both a reduction and extension to other types of purchases in any future
            agreement. In effect, what he is seeking is a 50 percent scaledown from June 30, 1966
            on. I previously analyzed <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s situation
            both economically and politically and concluded that he will not be bluffing.<note n="2" xml:id="d171fn2">
                            <ref target="#d163">Document 163</ref>.</note> He has little choice. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>, will, I predict, throw himself on the
            President's mercy on the basis of his and Germany's past performances as a good ally—ie,
            for having met the offset up till now, for the large increases in the German military
            budget from 1961–1964, for the purchase of Roosa bonds and for support of U.S. policy in
            Vietnam.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">U.S. Reaction</p>
                    <p>The U.S. reaction to <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s appeal will, I
            believe, be one of the most important decisions the U.S. has faced in the post-war
            period. It can be made only at the highest level in our Government. If we are able to
            reach agreement with <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> without
            significantly reducing U.S. combat forces in Europe, we have an opportunity to stabilize
            the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> of the 14 and U.S. relations with Germany at a
            critical time. If, however, we fail to reach agreement and move to reduce our combat
            forces in Germany (a division or more) as a direct consequence of German failure to meet
            the offset, the following adverse consequences can ensue:</p>
                    <p>A. The <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> Government will fall, or will in
            any event be irretrievably weakened. Neither he nor his successor, after such a U.S.
            turndown, would in the future be willing to base German policy on the U.S. with
            confidence. Germany and America will tend to drift apart.</p>
                    <pb n="418" xml:id="pg_418" facs="0448"/>
                    <p>B. The U.S. troop commitment is not to Germany but to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. It can be changed only after full discussion with <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. If it is known that we have presented <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> with a fait accompli on U.S. troop levels as a result
            of German failure to meet the offset, our position in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> will be greatly weakened as will the whole future of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> itself.</p>
                    <p>C. If we reduce our forces under such circumstances the British will, as they even now
            indicate, certainly do so. There is no reason why others should not follow suit—the
            unraveling of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> will begin.</p>
                    <p>D. It would be necessary to review the concept of flexible response which we have
            promoted, since the remaining <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> forces might have to
            resort immediately to the use of tactical nuclear weapons in the event of an all-out
            Soviet attack. Increased European pressure will result for the early use of our
            strategic forces—inviting Soviet retaliation on our cities.</p>
                    <p>E. The U.S. Seventh Army would be broken up as a fighting unit. The divisions sent home
            would probably be scattered and dissipated. A reduced 7th Army could not only not hope
            to stop a conventional Soviet attack but would, in all probability, not even be able to
            defend itself or retire in order.</p>
                    <p>F. The U.S. would have lost perhaps its only opportunity to bargain for the withdrawal
            of equivalent Soviet forces.</p>
                    <p>G. It would be clearly not just to Germans but demonstrated to Europeans that we put a
            low price tag on our military commitment to Europe. In the future Europeans would have
            little confidence in our assertions that American and European security are indivisible
            or that we, as we say, consider the Soviet threat to be undiminished.</p>
                    <p>H. Germany, which has until now depended almost entirely on the U. S. for its security,
            would be forced to reorient its basic security policy. This could take the form of
            increased dependence on Gaullist France, a “go-it-alone” nationalism or efforts to
            accommodate itself with the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>I. If Germany increases its forces to make up the gap created by our withdrawal, the
            status quo with the East would be altered and fears would be engendered in Europe as
            well as in the East.</p>
                    <p>J. The Soviets could be expected to assume a much stronger position vis-à-vis Germany
            and Europe. They would be in an increasingly better position to make exorbitant demands
            and engage in blackmail, particularly in Berlin where we, as principal recipients of
            such pressures, would have only a weakened 7th Army as backup.</p>
                    <p>K. America would no longer be able to play a decisive role in the great decisions
            affecting the future of Europe which still lie ahead. Western Europeans would
            increasingly tend to handle their own affairs independently, possibly including a
            rapprochement with the East.</p>
                    <pb n="419" xml:id="pg_419" facs="0449"/>
                    <p>L. Our ability to influence internal developments in Europe and to obtain support for
            U.S. efforts in other areas, such as Vietnam, would be greatly decreased.</p>
                    <p>M. Groups in America who are already clamoring for a reduction of U.S. troops in
            Germany will be encouraged by the example of their own Government. It would be difficult
            to arrest an increasingly isolationist trend.</p>
                    <p>Result: U.S. force reductions under present circumstances would, because of the
            cumulative effect of the foregoing, be considered generally as a major shift in U.S.
            policy. History would record it as the ebb point—the beginning of an American withdrawal
            from Europe.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Proposed Tactics in Dealing with <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>
                    </p>
                    <p>In order to avert the foregoing consequences, it is recommended that:</p>
                    <p>A. If, as I anticipate, <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> presents a
            strong case for relief under the present offset, that we accept debt pre-payments of
            $214 million and the purchase of Roosa bonds for $136 million in substitution for $350
            million in the present target (that amount not already budgeted or planned for including
            $170 million from the 1966 budget, a $250 million pre-payment in 1966 and $350 from the
            1967 budget).</p>
                    <p>B. That for the future, we agree with the Germans:</p>
                    <p>1. In order to effect a saving to Germany under the offset we will reduce our offset
            costs, beginning July 1, 1967, to a maximum figure to be subsequently agreed, through
            attrition of backup and logistical personnel (perhaps to $600 million through loss of
            between 25 and 35,000); the timing of the announcement of this move would be left open
            for agreement with the Germans in the light of their domestic situation.</p>
                    <p>2. German public purchases in the field of space, foreign aid and other areas where
            additionality can be established will be counted toward the offset where specifically
            approved (the annual amount in these categories will probably not exceed $25–50
            million); and that,</p>
                    <p>3. The remainder will be met through additional training and arms purchases to the
            maximum extent possible (even the Germans would agree to $350 million as a level of
            recurrent purchases), and where this is not possible by suitable financial arrangements
            (probably by the purchase of Roosa bonds).</p>
                    <p>C. That a joint U.S.-German Commission will be appointed to give effect to these
            recommendations which, in cooperation with the U. K. and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, would initiate studies as to:</p>
                    <p>1. German ability to meet the offset; and,</p>
                    <p>2. The optimum level of U.S. and other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> forces in
            Europe. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> would be appointed as our
            representative to this commission <pb n="420" xml:id="pg_420" facs="0450"/>heading a
            U.S. negotiating team composed of representatives of State, Defense and Treasury. The
            joint commission would meet as soon as possible and, as appropriate, with their U.K.
            opposite numbers, looking toward a final report, to be followed by review of their
            findings in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> insofar as troop levels are concerned,
            before the end of the year.</p>

            your blotter in the Cabinet Room.) At <hi rend="italic">Tab B is an intensively
              negotiated position paper on the major issues</hi>. It was produced by the <persName corresp="#p_BRJ1">Bowie</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">McNaughton</persName>/Deming/<persName corresp="#p_BFM1">Bator</persName> working group, after a lengthy discussion with

            the principals will approve the paper as an accurate reflection of their views, but,
            because it wasn't finished until late this afternoon, they have not had a chance
            personally to review it. Nor has <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt</persName>. At <hi rend="italic">Tab C is <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">George Ball</persName>'s vivid

                    <p>Strictly speaking, there are only two points of disagreement among your advisors. They
            are marked in the margin of the Tab B paper, which you should read first. Very
            briefly:</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">On the current offset</hi> (the agreement ending last June), your
            advis-ors agree that we must try to hold the Germans to the original payments schedule,
            but that we should let them meet that schedule in part through purchases of long-term
            bonds. <hi rend="italic">
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName>
                        </hi> believe that we should also offer to stretch out by 6–12 months the present
            requirement that the Germans place weapons <hi rend="italic">orders</hi> in the full
            amount ($1.4 billion) by the end of this calendar year. However, they would insist that
            the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
                        <pb n="421" xml:id="pg_421" facs="0451"/>come through with all of these weapons orders
            by the end of the stretch-out period. <hi rend="italic">
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> believes</hi> that we should agree to
            reduce the commitment to place weapons orders by the amount of the bond purchases. (My
            vote is with <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>, for reasons spelled out in his
            paper at Tab C.)</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">On dealing with the British</hi>, it is agreed that we should try
            to get them to delay announcement of <gloss target="#t_BAOR1">BAOR</gloss> cuts until
            the end of the trilateral talks (mid-January). <hi rend="italic">
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName>
                        </hi> believe that we should try to do this by diplomatic pressure alone, and that, if
            that fails, we should grin and bear it. <hi rend="italic">
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> believes</hi> that, if diplomatic pressure
            fails, we should offer to divert enough of our own defense orders to Britain to offset
            the foreign exchange cost of delaying the troop cuts (about $18 million for a
            three-month delay). (Again, my vote is with <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>.
            British troop cuts announced in mid-October and justified in balance-of-payments terms
            could undermine the entire trilateral exercise.)</p>

              Military Offset Agreement</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>It may become necessary to stretch out the military orders requirements of the current
            offset agreement, but we do not want to stretch out the payments requirements.</p>
                    <p>To meet the payments requirements, it probably will be necessary to work out
            arrangements between Finance Minister Dahlgruen and Bundesbank President <persName corresp="#p_BK3">Blessing</persName> and me.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">We need to have <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> on the
              line that the financial requirement will be met on time—that only the techniques need
              be worked out</hi>.</p>
                    <pb n="422" xml:id="pg_422" facs="0452"/>
                    <p>I do not feel that there would be any reasonable chance of success in making such
            arrangements unless Dahlgruen and <persName corresp="#p_BK3">Blessing</persName> were
            given firm instructions by <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> to do so.</p>
                    <p>Thus, if we are to employ this technique, it is important that you obtain a <hi rend="italic">firm commitment</hi> from <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> that a financial arrangement which meets our requirements <hi rend="italic">both in amount and time schedule</hi> will be concluded.</p>
                    <p>There are two possibilities:</p>
                    <p>a. If <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> is prepared to place orders for
            military equipment sufficient to fulfill his existing offset commitment but cannot
            obtain funds from the budget to meet the payments commitment, the shortfall should be
            made up by purchase of a <hi rend="italic">non-negotiable U.S. Government security which
              could, in substance, be redeemed only for the purpose of making payments for military
              equipment</hi>.</p>
                    <p>b. If <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> is unable to fulfill his
            commitments on the magnitude of military orders and on payments directly related to
            them, he should be asked to agree to the purchase of long-term United States securities
            equivalent to the shortfall in payments. Such securities should be of extended duration
            (12 to 15 years), since they would be a substitute for the sale of military equipment.
            Redemption prior to maturity could be permitted after the first few years, in the event
            that Germany encountered serious balance of payments difficulties. <hi rend="italic">The
              debt instrument could not, however, be readily negotiable. The criteria of extended
              duration and limited negotiabilty are essential elements which should be included in
              any understanding you reach with the Chancellor</hi>. The financial transaction would
            need to be in effect by June 30, 1967.</p>

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> opened the conversation by telling
            the Chancellor about the meeting with Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> the night before in New York.<note n="2" xml:id="d174fn2">A
              memorandum of conversation is ibid., Conference Files: Lot 67 D 586, CF 84.</note> He
            said the actual conversation had taken place after dinner and <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> who had spoken English at a preceding meeting had
            reverted to the use of an interpreter.</p>
                    <p>Most of the discussion had centered around bilateral matters, like the release of
            certain individuals in Soviet custody and proposed changes in the mutual civil air
            agreement. Another topic had been the Space Treaty, originally proposed in Geneva. Much
            time was spent talking about Vietnam. The atmosphere was calm, no threats and violent
            adjectives were used, as opposed to what happened in the <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>.<note n="3" xml:id="d174fn3">Although Vietnam was not an item on the
              General Assembly agenda, the Soviet Union used the time allotted to it in debate to
              charge that the United States and its South Vietnamese allies were waging a war of
              “aggression” and to call for U.S. military withdrawal and a negotiated settlement of
              the conflict. Soviet charges were set out in a letter to the Secretary-General, July
              11. (U.N. doc. S/7401)</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Hanoi had instructed Moscow they would not begin any negotiations before the U.S. had
            unilaterally stopped the bombings in North Vietnam. On the other had they had not
            promised to be ready to talk if the bombings would stop.</p>
                    <p>Equally on the subject of non-proliferation no new lines had developed. The Soviets
            continued to resist a treaty proposal that would not bar <pb n="424" xml:id="pg_424" facs="0454"/>the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries (non-nuclear) from
            getting access to nuclear weapons in one form or another. No new conclusions were
            reached, no progress made on this subject. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> and his delegation were present in New York and would try to follow
            up the subject.</p>
                    <p>The conversation had ended about 11 p.m.. He was expecting to have another meeting with
            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> in the near future.</p>
                    <p>Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> stated it was very hard to
            come up with satisfactory answers on some of these questions. As regarded the questions
            of Offset, a common strategy of defense, cooperation between the European partners,
            non-proliferation etc.—all these were intertwined and could hardly be discussed as
            separate entities.</p>
                    <p>How could one provide for a reasonable policy, make proper provisions for European
            Defense without knowing the exact concept of contemplated nuclear strategy. Old projects
            need not necessarily be revived (<gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>) but the question was how to find a common solution for
            all concerned.</p>
                    <p>If the two blocs agreed not to give nuclear weapons to their allies (<gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>-Warsaw Pact), there was still the question what would
            the “neutral” countries do. If the book was once closed, how could the cooperation
            continue, how could one still find a common solution?</p>
                    <p>The question was how to obtain a total nuclear strategy for the Alliance as a
            believable deterrent. This was a question that could not be evaded in the talks he
              (<persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>) had had with his delegation earlier
            that morning.</p>
                    <p>If the proposed tripartite talks would concentrate only on Offset, they would not be
            very useful. There should be talks first between the US and the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> on the aspects of their mutual security. In this direction German
            government policy needed some support. There were many influential people, if not in the
            administration then certainly in Parliament, that are unhappy with the current state of
            affairs and are looking for more or less strong alternatives or changes in the status
            quo. Sure, in the same breath they will declare they needed the U.S., would remain loyal
            to the U.S., etc., but in reality they were also looking in new directions. Some solid
            arguments were needed before the German people in order to reassure them.</p>
                    <p>The government was under much pressure. Just to get the 1967 Budget through Congress
            would be a gigantic task. Some 30 existing laws would have to be changed in order to
            reduce expenditures. This would have psychological consequences. Add to this the Offset
            burden and other political problems and you can see how difficult our situation is.</p>
                    <pb n="425" xml:id="pg_425" facs="0455"/>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> assured the Chancellor the U.S.
            government was aware of these difficulties and shared the concern. The President would
            meet him with an open mind and sympathetic attitude.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor added, he did not want to be misunderstood. There was no question of not
            keeping existing treaties and fulfilling obligations to the full amount. But under the
            circumstances an appropriate form would have to be found to allow the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> to keep its commitments in a way consistent with
            realistic possibilities. The Central Bank was trying not to jeopardize the dollar, the
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> was buying no gold, the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> was helping to support the Pound Sterling. Along similar lines, to be
            discussed in detail later, solutions may be found. This should be possible among close
            friends and allies. Among business partners too there was such a thing as a
            “prolongation”. A follow-up agreement could be worked out on June 1. An amicable
            solution of this matter among friends would be to the benefit of the President also, not
            just for the German government. It was important to successfully resolve this
            matter.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> to comment on some of these questions, as he
              (<persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>) had been in touch with the President and
            Cabinet while he (<persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>) was away in New York.</p>
                    <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> assured the Chancellor that
            the President had deep respect for the policy the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
            had followed domestically, with regard to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, its
            European policy, its Atlantic policy, its policy towards the underdeveloped nations and
            its support of the US position in Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>The US policy versus <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> had not changed. The US
            would keep its commitments. The US was paying a toll of a hundred lives a week to
            support a people of 14 million in <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The major question was how all the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nations could
            find a way to act together. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> had taken a
            big step away. Belgium was contemplating reduction of troops. Britain was thinking about
            reducing their troop strength. This erosion process was a matter of deep concern. If
            there was going to be a double standard it would be hard for the US Administration to
            defend itself against domestic pressures for reduction.</p>
                    <p>The problem should be approached from the angle of not jeopardizing the security of
            anybody. He (<persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>) was right in saying
            certain things could not be looked at separately. There should be a way of finding an
            arrangement without disturbing your (<gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>) problems
            further and without having to go to a postponement (of offset payments).</p>
                    <p>More flexible long-term agreements on balance of payment could be worked out that would
            include Britain. Britain had similar problems (<persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> Cabinet plans, reduction of <gloss target="#t_BAOR1">BAOR</gloss>)
            and domestic pressures that would have to be considered. Unilateral actions could
            further unravel the Alliance. One could have tripartite talks on these matters and still
            carry on bilateral talks. A solution would have to be found in terms of <pb n="426" xml:id="pg_426" facs="0456"/>everybody's security. Some aspects would have to be
            checked with all the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries. This approach
            would take the focus away from the balance of payments in the direction of common
            security.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor stated he was not in principle against tripartite talks. It seemed more
            important, however, for the US and the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> to talk
            bilaterally about their mutual problems (Offset, nuclear sharing). Some solution should
            first be found between the two, be it anywhere along the spectrum from a “hardware”
            solution to “Any kind of a voice” with regard to the nuclear question. Then one could
            also talk to the British. We are in touch with the British on foreign exchange matters
            already. A committee of top experts is to present proposals to the two governments by
            Oct. 13/14. This might provide a basis. Of course, he was attaching the necessary
            attention and importance to the British position on <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> (transport large units quickly once depots are available) troop
            strategy. Nor did he want to say that US troops should remain on German soil in all
            eternity. But at present their presence was very important. He needed to have a clear
            picture for himself and for the German people of their security within the Alliance. He
            must have a clear picture on nuclear matters. This was no longer avoidable.</p>
                    <p>Also the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> countries may soon grow into a political
            union which would have to be considered as a factor.</p>
                    <p>(From this point in this memorandum comments from the American side are not included,
            as simultaneous interpretation allowed no note-taking. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> was taking notes that might be available.)<note n="4" xml:id="d174fn4">Not found.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> said he could not only look
            at the non-proliferation question from the standpoint of German security, but would also
            have to consider the problem of reunification. The Germans knew reunification could only
            be achieved peacefully, but a number of peace-loving Germans that were trusting the US
            were very much concerned about an agreement that could perpetuate the status quo.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> asked the Chancellor's opinion on
            the German public attitude towards tripartite talks.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor replied there was no unfavorable public opinion other than the simple
            fear that the US wanted money of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and Britain
            wanted money of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, and now they wanted to gang up
            together to put Germany in a 2:1 minority. (Laughter)</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister Schroder commented what was needed was a clarification of the common
            objectives.</p>
                    <p>Sitting at the point of confrontation the German public was very sensitive about
            certain simple aspects of security. People ask what would <pb n="427" xml:id="pg_427" facs="0457"/>happen in the first minutes of a confrontation. Would the little region
            of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> really be defended? What would it take to
            release a nuclear counter attack? Any reduction of troops by allies, any talk in this
            direction from the Pentagon was making them more insecure and nervous. Some say why
            should we bother to maintain a high level of conventional troops, if others do not even
            maintain their low levels?</p>
                    <p>What was needed were some long-term assurances (like no reductions by 1970 or so) about
            maintaining levels. Any necessary reduction should be proposed within a general clear
            security strategy and be counterbalanced somehow, not done unilaterally or out of
            context.</p>
                    <p>The US, Germany and Britain should have some long-term consolidation, though not at the
            expense of other partners. A clear picture on this was necessary for any German
            government, even an <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> government, if such government
            was to meet its responsibility to its people.</p>
                    <p>Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> followed this up by pointing
            out the relative security felt by the people during the period of “massive retaliation”,
            when nobody ever criticized extra expenses in the defense sector, as opposed to the
            insecurity felt since the introduction of the “flexible response” strategy with its
            “thresholds” and “pauses”.</p>
                    <p>Should the Russians for example want to take Hamburg, the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> might reply with tactical nuclear weapons. The Soviets might answer with
            tactical nuclear weapons first also and might attack at another point. Would at this
            point, or a little later, the decision to employ a full response be made any easier for
            the US President with the fires of war already on the world's horizons?</p>
                    <p>To us, you and the Russians a big nuclear war is unthinkable as a solution. But then
            how believable is our strategy of deterrent to the man in the street in Germany. As long
            as there was the strategy of full response and sure retaliation it sounded
            believable.</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister Schroder suggested a military briefing of 45 minutes or so might be
            included during this visit (or if not now possibly at a later date). This briefing to be
            in the presence of the President, maybe by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, similar to a briefing Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> received in 1961.</p>
                    <p>Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> supported this idea. He once
            again conjured up the image of a small-scale Soviet attack on German territory.
            Somewhere along the line of escalation, the Soviets would have to be told: one more step
            will unleash the full nuclear force. With all our trust in the US and our allies will we
            and the man in the street be sure the rest of the world would be ready to die for the
            sake of saving Germany?</p>
                    <p>These are very realistic fears disturbing the German people.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Schroder added, it was exactly because of this why the presence of US troops was so
            important as a symbol of US involvment and a token and pledge of commitment. To him,
            frankly, the thesis of “massive retaliation” <pb n="428" xml:id="pg_428" facs="0458"/>never made any military sense but sounded just like a political argument that was
            convenient.</p>
                    <p>Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> stated that for the reasons
            cited by Schroder the US stand in Vietnam was so important and encouraging to the
            Germans.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> emphasized that the US had never
            abandoned any of the territory of its Allies and taken enormous casualties to honor
            their commitments. They had 7,000 warheads in Europe they would certainly not abandon to
            the Russians, and the only way the Russians could get them is “to have them stuffed down
            their throat”.</p>
                    <p>Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> said he fully trusted the US
            but had to consider the theoretical possibility of an agreement between the US and the
            Soviets never to attack each other to which the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
            could fall victim not having even a voice in nuclear defense. Such arguments could be
            heard in the Bundestag.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> assured the Chancellor he could
            understand his concern. He hoped the forthcoming talks would clarify many points. He had
            noted with curiosity that during the talks with East European foreign ministers at the
              <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in New York the usual invective against the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> was missing. There was a noticeable response to Mr.
            Schroder's policy of rapprochement. This was an encouraging sign.</p>

                    <p>Mr. President:</p>
                    <p>I have been in touch this morning with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, and
              <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">George Ball</persName>.</p>
                    <p>On the critical issue of the current offset agreement, they recommend the following for
            your talk with <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> at 11:30.<note n="2" xml:id="d175fn2">See <ref target="frus1964-68v13#d207">

                    </p>
                    <p>1. You recognize that his budgetary position does not permit him fully to offset, as
            promised, in military equipment.</p>
                    <pb n="429" xml:id="pg_429" facs="0459"/>
                    <p>2. It is, of course, impossible for the U.S. to carry the balance of payments effects
            of this situation.</p>
                    <p>3. Therefore, you are prepared to have his monetary experts and ours get to work
            immediately to find other means of offsetting U.S. balance of payments costs for the
            rest of the fiscal year.</p>
                    <p>4. The longer term solution must emerge from the tripartite military and financial
            review which you hope he will join. In this connection you hope he will appoint a man of
            the stature of <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">John McCloy</persName> capable of dealing
            with both the military and financial aspects of the longer term problem in the spirit of
            the Alliance.</p>
                    <p>P.S. If he agrees, you can then come back to the Cabinet Room and instruct your experts
            to work hard this afternoon to establish: (a) an agreed formula for the communiqué; (b)
            an agreed arrangement for working out the details on the short-term agreement in the
            days ahead, in which Joe Fowler might be our negotiator.</p>

                    <p>The President stated that the Chancellor had explained to him his budgetary
              difficulties.<note n="2" xml:id="d176fn2">At their 11 a.m. meeting; see <ref target="frus1964-68v13#d207">
                                <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1964–1968, vol. XIII, Document
              207</ref>.</note> While intending to fulfill his commitments, the <pb n="430" xml:id="pg_430" facs="0460"/>Chancellor had expressed the wish to find some other
            formula which would make it possible for the Germans to stretch out their payments
            beyond the due date of July 1, 1967. The President reported that he had told the
            Chancellor of our difficulties. He said even if the Germans had encountered no problem
            in meeting their current obligation to us, we still faced great problems. The President
            said he had suggested that his and the Chancellor's advisers get together to consider
            solutions to the current problem. The President said he had assured the Chancellor he
            understood his problems and didn't want to add to them. He remarked that neither of us
            wants to win an argument and lose a sale. He suggested that we examine the
            alternatives.</p>
                    <p>Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> reported he had told the
            President of the great value he placed on his relationship with the President and the
            talks they were having. He wanted to assure everyone that the Germans had stood
            faithfully by the United States, ready to support it, to support the U.S. dollar. Now
            the Germans found themselves in a situation where they found it difficult to meet their
            obligations within the time frame set. The Chancellor referred to his efforts to come up
            with as much of the offset as he could. He spoke of his conversation with the President
            of the Bundesbank. He asked that there be no misinterpretation placed upon German
            inability to fulfill its contract in time.</p>
                    <p>The President asked the Chancellor whom he wished to designate to meet with our experts
            to discuss the problem of the current offset. He thought that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> and Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> should form
            our team. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> suggested that the Germans
            include Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BK3">Blessing</persName> of the Bundesbank since
            obviously there would have to be financial discussions.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor reviewed some figures regarding funds available to the Germans. He said
            they could get $250 million from the Bundesbank to which they could add prepayment of
            the post-World War II debt of approximately $214 million. This would bring their total
            resources to $470 million.</p>
                    <p>At this point the President urged again that the experts meet to find a solution.
            Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> said he wished to add that
            the German Defense Budget would have to be increased to cover the present offset as well
            as the future one. It was agreed that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>,
            along with Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName>, would meet with their German counterparts
            later.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>The Chancellor thought it important that the search for solutions to the problems
            common to the two countries should in no way impair their traditional friendly relations
            and solidarity.</p>
                    <p>This solidarity should be emphasized to the public and not just an account given of the
            matters that were currently pressing. On the other hand one should avoid creating the
            impression that there were no problems. These should be talked about, but above all it
            should be made clear that friendship and solidarity remained unshaken.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary nodded his approval. He said he had been surprised by the atmosphere
            during his recent conversation with Soviet Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> in New York. He had expected the usual harsh language and threats.
            However <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had abstained from the usual
            invective against the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and from accusing the US on
            Vietnam. Not one angry word had fallen. This contrasted sharply with previous occasions
            when no opportunity had been missed to denounce the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>.
            The Secretary did not attach any particular importance to this but it seemed that
              <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had been under instructions from Moscow
            to abstain from violent adjectives.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor asked the Secretary how he appraised the outlook for a non-proliferation
            treaty after his talk with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary answered that matters stood where they had been before. A treaty that
            would allow the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries access to nuclear
            weapons was unacceptable to the Soviets. Because of their insistence on this point,
            there was no narrowing of the gap between the views of the two sides. He did not know if
            any importance could be attached to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s
            remark, when the latter's attention was directed to the Warsaw Pact nations, that we
            should not try to get involved in political relations between individual countries but
            rather concentrate on the real issue—the transfer of atomic weapons to non-nuclear
            nations. In the past, in <pb n="432" xml:id="pg_432" facs="0462"/>similar discussions,
            the Soviets had always brought forward an array of political arguments, especially about
            individual <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nations. The Secretary had once told
              <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> the latter sounded as if he was trying
            to obtain a 16th seat on the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Council with veto
            power.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor inquired if the Secretary was worried about any “nuclear power” ever
            getting involved in the Vietnam conflict. Seen from the perspective of Bonn it seemed
            that the Soviet Union was paying only lip service to the cause of Hanoi but did not
            really want to get involved.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary replied he had had a meeting with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RA4">Rapacki</persName> just before the talks with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d177fn2">See <ref target="frus1964-68v13#d206">
                                <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1964–1968, vol. XIII, Document
              206</ref>.</note> The Polish Foreign Minister had threatened that the entire communist
            bloc might get together to come to the aid of Hanoi if the US would continue the war in
            Vietnam. He had told <persName corresp="#p_RA4">Rapacki</persName> that the US was
            prepared to face the consequences of such an action.</p>
                    <p>No such remarks had come from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>,
            though the latter and the Polish Foreign Minister, he felt sure, were keeping each other
            informed.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor commented the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> was always hearing the
            bitterest language from Poland. They had given the harshest reply to the March Peace
            Note. This was all the more disappointing as there was much desire for reconciliation in
            the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, and the matter of borders would certainly
            present no problems in the event of German reunification.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary remarked it seemed to some people as if there were two blocs in Eastern
            Europe: a Northern Bloc, with a more frigid attitude, comprising the Soviet Union,
            Poland and the <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss>, and a Southern Bloc, comprising
            countries like Rumania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria, with an attitude more
            relaxed and open to the West.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor replied there was some truth in that theory. However, those three in the
            “Northern Bloc” surely did not look like natural allies. Poland's resentments applied to
            East Germans just about as much as to the West Germans. The relations between Poland and
            the Soviet Union had historically always been unfriendly. Maybe it was only the power of
            the Soviet Union that was keeping the three together.</p>
                    <p>He asserted that there was hardly a German left to whom the revision of the Oder-Neisse
            Line was sacred. Reasonable borders could be arranged. Some arguments were only retained
            as a political bargaining position, not out of conviction.</p>

                    <p>LBJ: Bob?</p>
                    <p>RSM: Yes, Mr. President.</p>
                    <p>LBJ: How did things go this afternoon?</p>
                    <p>RSM: Well, we didn't have any meetings. They kept postponing all afternoon and,
            obviously, didn't know what they wanted to do. Finally—so we cancelled our meetings with
            them. And we weren't much better off than they were. Every one of us has got a different
            idea of what ought to be done. Then about 6 O'clock, <persName corresp="#p_HKU1">Von
              Hassel</persName> called and asked if he could come over. I just arrived home from
            talking to him and he said that the Chancellor hasn't decided yet what to do but
              <persName corresp="#p_HKU1">Von Hassel</persName> said he wanted to give me his
            ideas. Now, I think he was sent in—</p>
                    <p>LBJ: Sure, sure.</p>
                    <p>RSM: … to float this. But the net of it all is that it's a terribly complicated thing.
            And the net of it is that they would fulfill the present offset agreement, but it would
            lag along awhile. They would use various means that I'm sure Joe [Fowler] wouldn't like
            but which, on balance, I think you could say fulfill the present offset agreement. And I
            think that one of our objections must be to put ourselves in a position to say to
              <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> they did fulfill it, even though it's
            by hocus-pocus. But, in any event, that's the first part. Secondly, for the future …</p>
                    <p>LBJ: Didn't say how?</p>
                    <p>RSM: Pardon me?</p>
                    <p>LBJ: Didn't say how?</p>
                    <p>RSM: Yes, they …</p>
                    <p>LBJ: Is he talking about prepaying this loan and stuff?</p>
                    <p>RSM: Well, that's one of the items. I said, well, we couldn't accept that, and so
            they've got an alternative. But—</p>
                    <p>LBJ: What is it, buying?</p>
                    <p>RSM: Well, they take . … they say that our Federal Reserve is holding—let me see
            now—there are short-term obligations which they would convert to medium term to the
            extent of 250 million this year and, depending upon that 214, either 178 next year or
            250 next year and then <pb n="434" xml:id="pg_434" facs="0464"/>an additional about 112
            the following year. In addition, they would increase their defense budget, which, for
            '67, starting January 1, is presently planned at 18–1/2 billion marks. They'd increase
            it by one billion marks, which is another 250 million. And out of all of this, they'd
            get enough to pay off. As far as the orders go, they would slip those six months and
            fulfill the order commitment by June 30 of next year. So, in a sense, I think there is a
            lot of negotiating on the details, but I think we can work out a satisfactory
            arrangement on the present offset, at least that would be satisfactory to me and, I
            think, Joe would probably accept it grudgingly ultimately. On the future—</p>
                    <p>LBJ: What would it do to our balance of payments this year?</p>
                    <p>RSM: Well—</p>
                    <p>LBJ: We're short 650 now on account of them.</p>
                    <p>RSM: That's right.</p>
                    <p>LBJ: How much would we be short if their proposal went through, three or four
            hundred?</p>
                    <p>RSM: Well, yes, about that. We'd get …</p>
                    <p>LBJ: About half of that?</p>
                    <p>RSM: There's a hundred-odd million that we seem to be in dispute on figures. I've got
            to straighten that out tonight. But then there is another 250 that we'd get this year,
            and the rest would come in next year, unless there was a 120 million or so slop-over
            into the following year. They say the Bundesbank is limited on the amount of conversions
            of short into mediums that they can take.</p>
                    <p>Then they say they don't want any more 2-year agreements. They'd like a 5-year
            agreement for the future, and they can only, in effect, offset 350 million. They'd
            purchase 350 million a year from us and pay for it on a specified schedule. The
            purchases would start next year—if I understood this correctly—and run for the 5 years
            through 1971, and the payments would start the following year and run through 1972, 350
            a year, which is less than half of what we'll spend because, as their price level rises
            and as our military salaries rise, our foreign exchange costs go up. They have averaged
            725 million a year, we believe, in '65 and '66. We think they'll average for the next 5
            years, 850 million, and of the 850 million, they would offset only 350.</p>
                    <p>LBJ: Uh huh.</p>
                    <p>RSM: Now, I think we can reduce that 850 some.</p>
                    <p>LBJ: How much, when you pull all your troops out of there? Just suppose that you
            decided that we couldn't afford it—</p>
                    <p>RSM: Right.</p>
                    <p>LBJ:—we had to move them back—</p>
                    <p>RSM: Right, right.</p>
                    <pb n="435" xml:id="pg_435" facs="0465"/>
                    <p>LBJ:—we could get them back with all your—</p>
                    <p>RSM: Yeah.</p>
                    <p>LBJ:—modern transportation and everything pretty quick, couldn't you?</p>
                    <p>RSM: Well, this is where we get lots of controversy, Mr. President. I believe we could.
            Of course, if we were going to pull them all out, it would be quite a difficult movement
            back because we just have—I've forgotten the tonnage—something like a million tons of
            equipment would be in Germany. We've had 750,000 tons in Germany and 750,000 tons in
            France, if I recall correctly, and that's a tremendous quantity of stuff to move. But
            what we'd do, if we pulled them all out—which I think is such an extreme situation, I
            can hardly visualize it—but if we did, we'd leave practically all the equipment there,
            and we'd have to hire some Germans to oil it and maintain it, and then we'd have to run
            exercises periodically, putting the troops back in so we'd get some skill at it. I think
            it's inconceivable to pull them all out, but if we did, it would take a month to get
            them back, which is far beyond the limits of what others consider reasonable warning
            time. It might take a month and a half to get them back. If, on the other hand, we
            pulled, let's say, 55,000 out, plus half the Air Force, I think we could get those back
            easily in 2 weeks. And it's inconceivable to me that the Russians would go from a period
            of calmness to a full invasion of Germany in less than 2 weeks. I just don't think it
            could be done.</p>
                    <p>So from a military point of view, Mr. President, I think substantial force adjustments
            are justified. Unless we handle it right, however, there would be a terrible political
            cost. And that's our problem.</p>
                    <p>LBJ: Well, how do we handle that right?</p>
                    <p>RSM: Well, I don't know. I think tonight and tomorrow we ought to—</p>
                    <p>LBJ: Looks like to me, we ought to take advantage of this opportunity to make him tell
            us that he cannot afford to have our troops there.</p>
                    <p>RSM:—and he wants our troops out. That's what I think we ought to do, Mr. President.
            That's right. That's exactly right. And I worked on Hassel some in Paris on this exact
              point.<note n="2" xml:id="d178fn2">At the July 26 meeting of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Nuclear Planning Working Group; see <ref target="frus1964-68v13#d189">

            think, conceivably, we can take some out. But today, they began taking the line that
            they didn't think we ought to take any out until 1969 or '70. Schroeder asked me if we
            couldn't get you to make a statement to <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>
            to that effect during the meetings, and I said that I was almost certain you wouldn't be

            That you would want the tripartite group to examine that. Then this afternoon—</p>

                    <p>The President presented to the Chancellor a draft proposing the establishment of rapid

            agreed to the draft and both initialed it.</p>
                    <p>The President then discussed with the Chancellor the communiqué to be issued.<note n="3" xml:id="d179fn3">For text, see <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy:
                Current Documents, 1966</hi>, pp. 403–406.</note> On most points there was
            agreement. The Chancellor first objected to the inclusion of reference to certain
            initiatives of the Italian government in the field of technical cooperation on space and
            related matters.</p>
                    <p>The President called in <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt W. Rostow</persName> who
            convinced the Chancellor that inclusion of this reference was no longer avoidable as the
            Chancellor's Cabinet Ministers had already agreed to it and the Italian government had
            been informed. The Chancellor then agreed to the inclusion.</p>
                    <p>Another item the Chancellor objected to was the inclusion of the term “cold war”, used
            with reference to relations with Eastern Europe. The Communist camp was always employing
            the term “cold war” in their tirades against the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and
            using the two words (cold war-West Germany) in one breath constantly. After consulting
            with Mr. Rostow, all sides then agreed to a new version of this paragraph.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor told the President briefly about the talks held earlier that morning
            with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> on the <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> Round.<note n="4" xml:id="d179fn4">Memoranda of conversation of

                    <p>The President brought up the subject of Indonesia.<note n="2" xml:id="d180fn2">Reference is to the suppression by the Indonesian army of a Communist-inspired
              coup.</note> He outlined the situation there and the scope of American assistance and
            emphasized how much was at stake. What had happened there was a great victory for the
            West but had not been sufficiently publicized by the news media. One reason why the US
            government had not emphasized the success too much was that there had been some
            uncertainty if the improved situation was definitely there to stay. Because of this
            uncertainty it was extremely important for the Free World to assist in any way possible.
            This might tip the scale in their favor. The US would aid Indonesia to the tune of
            several hundred million dollars. He asked the Chancellor if the German government could
            find a way to help the Indonesian government through such measures as the sale of
            machine tools on favorable credit terms.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor said he agreed that this was an important area. The attitude of the
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> toward Indonesia had changed since the disposal of
            Sukarno. He would see what he could do in this direction.</p>
                    <p>He assured the President of his great admiration for his handling of the crisis in
            Southeast Asia, that the President had gone to the limit of his possibilities
            unhesitatingly, which showed his great courage and firmness to support the cause of
            freedom all over the world and stem the Communist tide.</p>
                    <p>He emphasized that the results of the Vietnamese elections had been a very good
              thing.<note n="3" xml:id="d180fn3">The elections were held September 11.</note> It had
            answered those critics that contended that the <pb n="439" xml:id="pg_439" facs="0469"/>United States was defending South Viet-Nam against Communism against the will of the
            South Vietnamese.</p>
                    <p>The President said there were some hopeful signs in Southeast Asia. He mentioned the

                    <p>Mr. President:</p>
                    <p>In connection with our position on non-proliferation, this [<hi rend="italic">less than
              1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] report, which I take to be accurate,
            should be read.</p>
                    <p>It shows clearly both the German commitment to non-proliferation and the problem they
            would have if we tried to jam down their throats the sort of agreement now proposed to
            us by the Russians.</p>
                    <p>In particular it shows that we will have problems, which I believe are surmountable, if
            we make explicit in a treaty our position on the veto.</p>
                    <p>If we go beyond, with the Soviet language, I think we have a better than even chance
            that the Germans would not go with us.</p>

                    <p>The following is a position paper on the problem of nuclear non-proliferation prepared
            by the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_CSU1">CSU</gloss> Bundestag
            Fraktion Committee for defense and foreign policy. The draft, which is dated 29 June
            1966, was prepared by the Committee after presentations made by the German observer in
            Geneva, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SS11">Schnippenkoetter</persName>, on 15
            February and 19 April. The drafting committee consisted of Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BK6">Kurt Birrenbach</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_GKTF1">Theodor
              Baron Von Und Zu Guttenberg</persName> and Dr. Werner Marx.</p>
                    <p>The Committee recognizes the decision of the Federal Government to support in principle
            non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, i.e., not to put these at the disposition of the
            national authorities of non-nuclear powers.</p>
                    <p>The Committee doubts whether a global agreement, as sought by the nuclear powers, is
            the most practical method to achieve non-proliferation.</p>
                    <p>The Committee is working on the assumption that none of the powers now in possession of
            nuclear weapons has any intention of giving such weapons to other states. In view of the
            special structure of the Warsaw Pact, this hypothesis is considered to be particularly
            valid for the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>The Committee notes that the Federal Republic surrendered the right to manufacture
            nuclear weapons when it signed the Paris Agreement of 1954.<note n="3" xml:id="d181fn3">For text, see <hi rend="italic">Documents on Germany, 1944–1985</hi>, pp.
              425–434.</note> The Committee therefore expects other states whose status is
            comparable to that of the Federal Republic to make a similar renunciation before the
            Federal Republic is asked to offer additional concessions.</p>
                    <p>The Committee views an unqualified ban against proliferation as tantamount to a
            division of the world into nuclear and non-nuclear powers. Such an arrangement,
            chartered as it would be in international law, could prejudice the security and the
            political roles of the non-nuclear powers for an unforeseeable future. It would have a
            particularly negative effect on a united Europe of the future.</p>
                    <p>It is the opinion of the Committee that a non-proliferation accord must be reached
            within the wider framework of a disarmament agreement. Such an agreement should provide
            for a step-by-step reduction of nuclear weapons and carriers currently in the possession
            of the nuclear <pb n="441" xml:id="pg_441" facs="0471"/>powers, make arrangements for
            appropriate controls, and ensure that the strategic balance of power both on the
            European continent as well as in the world as a whole is not disturbed. This requirement
            appears to the Committee all the more necessary because the non-nuclear powers of Europe
            obviously feel themselves threatened by the more than 700 Soviet medium-range missiles
            emplaced along the Western frontier of the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>The Committee sees a decisive difference between a waiver to the right to possess
            nuclear weapons which is made to an ally and an agreement involving a third power such
            as is proposed in the present drafts. The latter would make the Soviet Union the arbiter
            over the nuclear structure of the Western Alliance.</p>
                    <p>The Committee is firm in the belief that the Federal Republic should participate in a
            non-proliferation agreement if the following conditions are met:</p>
                    <p>a. That the possibility for an agreement providing for the shared control of nuclear
            weapons among the powers of the Atlantic or European areas is neither excluded nor
            prejudiced.</p>
                    <p>b. That an agreement is reached which safeguards the interests of the Federal Republic
            and of the other free nations of Europe.</p>
                    <p>c. That the international situation of the Federal Republic and especially its
            objectives in respect to all-German policy should not be prejudiced in either a formal
            or a substantive sense as a result of its participation in an agreement to which the
            Soviet Union is also a signatory.</p>
                    <p>d. Within the context of Section V, Item 1 of the German Peace Note of 25 March
              1966,<note n="4" xml:id="d181fn4">For an extract of the note, see ibid., pp.
              914–918.</note> the above signifies:</p>
                    <p>1. That the Federal Republic's claim to be the only legal representative of Germany is
            fully recognized in the agreement.</p>
                    <p>2. That the regulation of the military status of Germany, the implementation of which
            is reserved for an all-German Peace Treaty, should not be prematurely applied to a
            divided Germany.</p>

            on the President's speech of October 7 before the editorial writers in New York.<note n="2" xml:id="d182fn2">For text of the speech, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of

                    </p>
                    <p>The German Foreign Office had noted the President's speech with great interest and
            regarded it as significant. They welcomed the President's avowal of American
            responsibilities vis-à-vis Europe and the emphasis he placed on the interdependence of
            the Atlantic Alliance as well as the affirmation of the partnership between the United
            States and a united Europe. The Germans also welcomed the desire, expressed by the
            President, to arrive at an understanding with the East. The Germans noted with
            satisfaction that President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> adhered to
            the view that peace in Europe was not assured as long as the cruel division of Germany
            was not removed. The Germans, finally, welcomed the remarks by the President that troop
            levels in Europe would be determined by the assessment of the threat and that a
            reduction of Western troops would be made contingent upon a lowering of troop levels on
            the side of the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_LG3">Von Lilienfeld</persName> reported that <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> wished to point out, however, that he had noted
            in a number of places deviations from formulas used in the past. He did not want to
            exaggerate the significance of these new formulations, but could not help but express
            some concern that the Soviets might conclude from these new formulations that we had
            decided to opt for the status quo in Europe. Carstens referred to three subjects in this
            connection.</p>
                    <p>The first concerned the German question. While noting with satisfaction that the
            reunification of Germany remained, as before, the objective <pb n="443" xml:id="pg_443" facs="0473"/>of American policy, the Germans had got the impression from the speech
            that the reunification of Germany was seen by the United States no longer as an issue
            which would be realized simultaneously with the relaxation of tensions but was viewed
            rather as the end result of the détente. The Germans noted further in this connection
            that the President's speech did not touch upon Four-Power responsibility for German
            reunification nor the right of self-determination on the part of the Germans. They noted
            also the absence of the formulation that the Federal Republic was the sole
            representative of all Germans.</p>
                    <p>In connection with the frontiers, <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> wished
            to point out that the American Government until now had consistently repeated the view
            that the final determination of Germany's borders would have to await a peace settlement
            involving all of Germany. <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> noted that it
            was not possible to tell from the remarks of the President whether this continued to be
            the view of the American Government.</p>
                    <p>The third German concern entailed the question of priorities in security matters. The
            Germans noted that the confrontation between the Warsaw and Atlantic Pacts could only be
            overcome on the basis of the status quo, if progress in resolving the German question
            was not made a condition. This gave the Germans concern. In the German view the two were
            irrevocably linked.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary promised to study the German observations and in due time give them our
            comments. In the meantime he wished to make the following immediate comments:</p>
                    <p>1. He thought the President had placed unusual emphasis on German reunification.</p>
                    <p>2. On the question of the reunification of Germany and the relaxation of tensions
            between East and West, he noted that we were simply agreeing with our European friends
            who have been telling us all along that German reunification cannot be obtained until
            after a détente had been achieved. He noted in this connection that Europeans generally,
            including the Germans, were out in front of us in seeking relations with the Eastern
            Europeans.</p>
                    <p>On the subject of what was omitted from the speech, the Secretary simply wished to note
            that the President had made a short speech which could not be complete in every respect.
            He reiterated however that he would give a more detailed reply to the Germans in the
            near future.</p>

                    <p>2. From <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName>'s viewpoint there are
            important long and short-term advantages which seem to outweigh the disadvantages. An
            important long-range gain for the Soviets is the establishment of direct contacts and
            continuing discussions with a potential German government leader at a time when the
            ruling parties in Bonn appear to be in some disarray. This offers the Soviets both a
            certain assurance for the future and a shorter-term prospect that the present Bonn
            government might feel itself compelled to initiate new policies of its own toward the
            East, from which the Soviets may benefit. Continuance and expansion of the
              Brandt-<persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> relationship therefore offer
            possibilities for (A) giving further impetus to the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss>
            inclination, marked since the Dortmund Convention, to undertake new approaches toward
            the East; and (B) nurturing suspicion and friction between the principal parties on the
            domestic political scene, between Berlin and Bonn, and between Brandt and the Allies in
            Berlin.</p>
                    <p>3. On Berlin matters, <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> will undoubtedly
            be considering ways in which the Soviets can capitalize on Brandt's desire to give
            Berlin a new role in East-West matters. By encouraging Brandt in thinking that certain
            of his Berlin projects might get Soviet support he may see a means for obtaining
            Brandt's backing, or at least tacit acceptance, of an increased Soviet presence and role
            in West Berlin. Direct dealings with Brandt as GovMayor would give substance to the
            Eastern thesis that West Berlin is a “special political entity,” they would tend to
            weaken the link between Berlin and the Federal Republic, and they would promote a de
            facto Quadripartite status in West Berlin alone.</p>
                    <p>4. The principal disadvantage for <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> is
            the effect of his association with Brandt on his relations with <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>
            is certainly <pb n="445" xml:id="pg_445" facs="0475"/>anything but pleased at the
            prospect of a continuing—and perhaps expanding—dialogue, since this reinforces the
            overriding role of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> as the most useful party
            for West Germans to talk with on all-German matters. It makes clear that the Soviets
            intend to maintain as many channels as possible for dealings on the German and Berlin
            problems. It undermines somewhat <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>'s own
            efforts to foster “negotiations” in various channels with the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and the West Berlin Senat. Although the dialogue thus raises certain
            doubts and fears among the East German leaders, they certainly are aware that they
            cannot effectively prevent it. The Soviets doubtless know this too and will therefore
            want to press ahead without too much concern for East German anxieties and
            misgivings.</p>
                    <p>5. From Brandt's viewpoint the dialogue with <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> is another step forward in the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss>'s effort to open new avenues of approach to the East, an effort in which
            Brandt has himself taken the leading role. In domestic political terms he has seen the
            opportunity to build up his own prestige nationally by demonstrating imagination and
            initiative on East-West matters shortly before important elections in two West German
            Laender. In a broader sense he has achieved greater maneuverability for himself
            vis-à-vis the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and has undercut to some extent the
            latter's hoped-for role on all-German matters. While the immediate political benefits
            are important to him, it is our belief that he conceives of his new relationship
            primarily as offering a hope for eventually breaking through the impasse that has
            characterized the German problem for many years, and regarding which he and many other
            Germans have concluded that the Allies are not going to create movement.</p>
                    <p>6. In West Berlin political terms these meetings mark a new phase in the post-Wall
            history of the city. Only about a year ago such encounters would have been criticized
            whereas now they are generally accepted and even widely approved. Brandt not only
            perceived this trend but helped to create the conditions that made such talks possible.
            While his primary interests are undoubtedly broader than Berlin, he sees the dialogue
            also as a step forward in his efforts to improve Berlin's position in a changing
            East-West situation. He sees opportunities, moreover, for going around Pankow and
            establishing a direct line which can be helpful in getting the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> to agree to improvements in the Berlin situation. Brandt may regard his
            contact with <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> as being favorable to
            Allied interests as well, or at the least, he may consider that certain of his Berlin
            interests can be moved ahead without running into direct conflict with Allied rights and
            responsibilities.</p>
                    <p>7. It is in this area that the most difficult problems arise for the Allies. The
            Soviets, for example, might be led to believe that they can achieve certain objectives
            in Berlin regardless of Allied objections by dealing directly with Brandt. So long as
            Brandt sincerely pursues interests <pb n="446" xml:id="pg_446" facs="0476"/>which are
            shared by the Allies and the Senat and so long as he is forthcoming with us about his
            talks, they may be advantageous to both. If, however, he established arrangements for a
            continuing dialogue with the Soviets, the contents of which may not be fully revealed to
            the Allies and which may touch on Allied interests, this could lead ultimately to an
            undermining of the Allied position in the city. In the past Brandt has been mindful of
            Allied interests and realistic in his handling of them, but it may be necessary for him
            to be reminded occasionally that he cannot deal with the Soviets officially and with
            commitment of matters relating to Berlin which affect Allied rights and
            responsibilities. In the most recent meeting (October 12) Brandt discussed certain
            specific Berlin problems which have heretofore been handled by the Allies and suggested
            continuing Soviet-Senat contact on them. This represents a departure from his earlier
            comments (September 29) to <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> that such
            matters were for discussion with the Allies. As indicated in Bonn 4735<note n="3" xml:id="d183fn3">Dated October 19. (Department of State, Central Files, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss>

                    <p>5393. Subject: Implications of a new German Govt<note n="2" xml:id="d184fn2">On October
              27 the <gloss target="#t_FDP1">FDP</gloss> members of the Erhard Cabinet resigned. The
                <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_CSU1">CSU</gloss> agreed on
                <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kurt Georg Kiesinger</persName> as their candidate

              on November 30.</note> for US policy.</p>
                    <p>1. While the Embassy will continue to report significant day to day developments
            affecting the current German governmental crisis, it may <pb n="447" xml:id="pg_447" facs="0477"/>be useful at this point to attempt some assessment of the overall
            implications insofar as US interests are concerned. The still fluid situation in Bonn as
            to the precise contours of the next govt brings with it both opportunities and dangers
            in our relations with Germany. At this juncture, the latter will probably
            predominate.</p>
                    <p>2. There is reason to think that Germany has reached a watershed in its postwar
            political development. In retrospect, it may well appear that the <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> govt was the last govt of the postwar era. There
            are, of course, objective limits within which German policy must develop. However, the
            postwar era was also marked by many self-imposed limits. Some of these will now
            disappear, regardless of the composition of the next govt. This will become especially
            notable if <gloss target="#t_CSU1">CSU</gloss> leader <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName>, as appears likely, should occupy an important position in a new
            govt; however, it is basically not a matter of personalities. A trend toward greater
            self-assertion and closer attention to specific German interests has, of course, been
            evident for some time. It has not yet markedly affected German foreign policy, mainly
            because the Erhard govt tended to respond more to the traditional postwar influences
            than to the new demands for greater German assertiveness. The next govt will, we
            believe, cease to operate in this postwar framework, which was characterized inter alia
            by a disposition on the part of the German Govt to look to us for guidance on almost any
            given issue.</p>
                    <p>3. There is a natural German tendency for French influence to fill any vaccum left by a
            diminution of Germany's ties with the US. The momentum toward closer relations with
            France will probably continue for some time. Although it is unlikely to result in basic
            policy changes, since the French have in the final analysis little to offer the Germans,
            the new govt will doubtless try to give the public impression of a better “balance” in
            its relations with the US and France.</p>
                    <p>4. On the other hand, the impending change in govt will also bring opportunities for us
            as well as Germany. While the new govt which finally emerges from the transitional
            period will almost certainly be more difficult to deal with than its predecessor, it
            will also be a more strongly led govt, more willing to play an active role. It will be
            better able to fulfill its undertakings. Although the new govt will not proceed from the
            assumption that there is a virtual identity of US and German interests, it can be
            expected to recognize that there will remain a large area where our mutual interests are
            sufficiently close to permit fruitful cooperation. After all, Germany must continue to
            rely on us for its basic security.</p>
                    <p>5. During this transitional period, we shall obviously have to proceed with great
            caution. There is a tendency, although fortunately not expressed widely or forcefully,
            to put some of the blame on us for the demise of the <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> govt. President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>'s
            press conference statement <pb n="448" xml:id="pg_448" facs="0478"/>of Oct. 28<note n="3" xml:id="d184fn3">For text, see <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">Charles de
                Gaulle</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Discours et Messages</hi>, vol. 5, pp.
              96–117.</note> was undoubtedly meant, with deliberate intent, to be the coup de grace
            for <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> as the man who had spurned
            cooperation with France in favor of a close tie to the US. Fortunately for us, however,
            there are so many obvious reasons why <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>
            must be replaced, and the view that he must is so universally held here, that we may get
            off lightly.</p>
                    <p>6. What should we do in the meantime? Some of the immediate consequences are obvious,
            and we do not wish to belabor them. We must lean over backward in order to avoid the
            impression that we are in any way interfering in the present crisis. We can probably
            live with any govt that emerges—no matter who is Chancellor or what form the coalition
            takes. There will be a tendency here to look closely for indications of US intervention,
            and every statement we make will be combed over with this in mind. During the period in
            which we must wait for the formation of the new govt we should, through our normal
            foreign policy pronouncements do what we can to create an atmosphere which will work in
            our favor in its selection and orientation. The following issues appear to be
            relevant.</p>
                    <p>A. The offset.</p>
                    <p>Any concessions made now to <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> under the
            current offset would appear to be an intervention in his behalf. The best we can do is
            to maintain a neutral stance, and stand ready to enter into discussions with any
            government that emerges on how the current German undertakings will be fulfilled. It
            will continue to be difficult for us to grant concessions at this stage, even if we so
            desired, since it would be hard to explain why we offer to a new Chancellor what we
            withheld from <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>. A forum now exists in the
            Trilateral Committee for discussion of future offset agreements, which obviates the
            need, for the time being, for us to make any new statements on this issue.</p>
                    <p>When the new government is ready to deal with this problem, it is conceivable that we
            may be confronted with a firm German proposal, with Parliamentary backing. We do not, at
            this juncture, believe that such a proposal would seek to renege on the current
            commitment to pay <gloss target="#t_DM1">DM</gloss> 3.8 billion—or necessarily to seek a
            moratorium; however, it may affect the mode of payment. Any proposal on a longer range
            offset in the Trilateral Committee will probably correspond closely to that made by
            Erhard in Washington.</p>
                    <p>B. Trilateral talks.</p>
                    <p>Little progress can be expected on the broad policy aspects of the Trilateral talks
            until a new German Govt has had time to determine its policy toward the issues involved.
            Earlier actions to induce the Germans to accept decisions—especially on troop
            withdrawals which they will <pb n="449" xml:id="pg_449" facs="0479"/>probably oppose
            strongly—should be avoided. If the Germans get the impression that vital security
            objectives are being sacrificed because of US–<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
            financial requirements, they may seek an alternative—such as a closer bilateral
            understanding with the French—which would be damaging to the Western Alliance.</p>
                    <p>C. Détente.</p>
                    <p>During the last year German opinion on Eastern policy and reunification has been
            developing quite favorably from our point of view. However, the process has been slow
            and uneven and these issues remain among the most contentious in German politics. During
            this transitional period we will, therefore, want to exercise great care in interpreting
            our own policy on these issues. The central theme of such interpretations should be to
            emphasize that we have no intention of jettisoning our fundamental postwar policy in
            Central Europe. Our basic position on Germany's Eastern frontiers, and of active support
            of German reunification by whatever peaceful means are available, remain unchanged. On
            the other hand we would not wish to negate the basic Eastward-looking impact of the
            President's speech of Oct 7.</p>
                    <p>D. Presidential visit.</p>
                    <p>Until <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s fate is determined, it would of
            course be inappropriate to say anything about a possible Presidential visit to Germany,
            resulting from the invitation <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> recently
            extended in Washington. Soon after a new Chancellor takes office, we will undoubtedly
            wish to invite him to Washington. If on this occasion the new Chancellor should issue a
            new invitation and if the European situation as a whole is appropriate, I would hope
            that the President could respond favorably.</p>
                    <p>E. Non-proliferation.</p>
                    <p>We should not, during this period, take any decision to make important substantive
            changes in our draft non-proliferation treaty, especially if they effect options on a
              <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> or European nuclear arrangement. After a new
            government is formed, careful consideration should be given as to how consultations on
            this issue should be handled. Since there is much apprehension here that we will present
            the Germans with a fait accompli on this issue, we should take every opportunity to
            reassure them that they will be fully consulted.</p>
                    <p>8. The foregoing views must necessarily be only tentative and subject to revision in
            the light of what is a rapidly changing situation. We should, however, be fully aware
            that an important turning point has now been reached in Germany, and be ready to take
            advantage of any opportunities favorably to affect the attitude of a new government.
            Forbearance may, however, at a given point be just as important in this connection as
            speedy action.</p>

            troops in Germany, exchange of observers, etc.</p>
                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_SVS1">Semenov</persName>, whose previous comments made it
            clear Sovs want preserve status quo in Germany, responded in very guarded manner. He
            said it was difficult for him to comment as these questions had recently been
            overshadowed by others and were outside scope Soviet attention. However, he expressed
            view all those questions were not dead; they had not arisen by accident, and would have
            to be reverted to at some point if peace in Europe to be strengthened. Citing
            non-proliferation as example, he also noted that those questions might again arise in
            somewhat different form.</p>
                    <p>3. While <persName corresp="#p_SVS1">Semenov</persName>'s remarks seem indicate
            continued Sov interest in some form of limited disengagement in Europe, I do not believe
            Sovs would be interested at this time in any formal arrangement re mutual troop
            reductions. For one thing, in view publicity this question in Western press they
            probably assume that US–<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> troop levels in Europe would
            be reduced in any event. Also, they would not wish to substantiate ChiCom charges re
            US-Soviet collusion by entering formal agreement which could be interpreted as allowing

            most, however, is that <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> suggestion, apart from its
            own inherent complications, would inevitably involve us in discussions with Sovs on
            broader aspects of German problem, including Berlin and Oder-Neisse questions, which at
            this time could not be profitable and could only disturb present quiet on that

                    <p>6452. Personal for the Secretary from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName>. Subj: Berlin voting rights. I am sending this telegram to you
            personally because I know of your interest in this matter. Since I consider it very
            important that our position in the matter be made at the highest level in the Dept., I
            would appreciate a personal reply.</p>
                    <p>1. As you know, the issue of voting rights for Berlin Bundestag Deputies has again
            arisen in connection with the current governmental crisis in Berlin. A so-called
            mini-coalition between the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_FDP1">FDP</gloss> which was at one time seriously considered could only
            have been viable on the basis of the Berlin votes. When the three Allies, according to
            plans approved in the three capitals, reiterated in response to press queries that the
            Allied position on voting rights had not changed, Brandt and <persName corresp="#p_ME4">Mende</persName> of the <gloss target="#t_FDP1">FDP</gloss> reacted sharply. In fact,
            it is obvious that if the Allies at this critical point had changed a position dating
            from 1949, as a favor to one German political party in resolving a political crisis in
            its favor, it would have been tantamount to Allied intervention in German domestic
            politics. State Sec <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName>, in a Quadripartite
            Berlin meeting yesterday, agreed fully that the three had no other choice.</p>
                    <p>2. The likelihood now is that a grand coalition between the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> will be established in the
            formation of which the Berlin votes will have no importance. The immediate urgency of
            the issue has, therefore, probably passed. I believe that it is quite possible, however,
            that after the new government is in office, it may seek a change in the Allied position
            because of (A) the public discussion that has been renewed on the matter, (B) the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> long-range interest in having its strength in Berlin
            accrue to its strength in the Bundestag, and (C) the likelihood that the new government
            will pursue a more active policy on Berlin and all-German questions. This will be
            particularly true if Brandt becomes <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>3. I therefore believe that it is necessary to consider now what the US position should
            be if faced with such a request. Before the Tripartite position was made clear by the
            three Embassies, Brandt appears to have been acting on the assumption that Washington
            would not insist on the maintenance of the reservation on voting rights. He still
            appears to detect a cleavage on this issue between the Embassy and the Department. This
            matter is of such importance that, in my opinion, an established US position <pb n="452" xml:id="pg_452" facs="0482"/>is required which can serve as guidance in our
            discussions—either locally or in Washington—with representatives of the new
            government.</p>
                    <p>4. In formulating our position, I believe that we must have a clear understanding of
            the political and legal consequences for our presence in Berlin which could result from
            the voting of Berlin Deputies. First, let us take a look at the legal background. The
            issue of the voting rights of the Berlin delegates in the Federal legislative bodies
            lies at the very heart of Quadripartite agreements defining Berlin's special status. For
            the purpose of exercising their occupation rights in Germany, the four powers agreed in
            the London Protocol of September 12, 1944,<note n="2" xml:id="d186fn2">For text, see <hi rend="italic">Documents on Germany, 1944–1985</hi>, pp. 1–3.</note> to divide
            Germany into four Occupation Zones and to create a special “Berlin area.” Greater Berlin
            was not at any time part of any of the four Zones of Occupation. For this reason, the
            three Allies have repeatedly rejected the Soviet claim that Berlin is “in” or “a part
            of” the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. By the same token, the three Allies have
            taken the position that Berlin may not form a part of the Federal Republic.</p>
                    <p>5. In accordance with these principles the Military Governors, in May 1949,<note n="3" xml:id="d186fn3">For text, see ibid., pp. 260–262.</note> took action to ensure that
            Berlin was not incorporated into the organization of the Federal Republic as originally
            contemplated by the framers of the Basic Law. While permitting “greater Berlin” to
            participate “in the federation,” the Military Governors withheld from Berlin
            representatives the right to vote in these bodies and also decreed that Berlin may not
            be governed by the federation.</p>
                    <p>6. If Berlin Delegates were to exercise full voting rights in the Federal legislative
            bodies, this would mean that the Berlin population and Land Berlin through their
            representatives would participate in an essential function of government in the Federal
            Republic like the rest of the West German population. Voting membership of the Berlin
            Delegates in the Federal legislative bodies thus would mean de facto membership of
            Berlin in the Federal system, contrary to the Quadripartite agreements. The membership
            would likely become increasingly de jure as the Federal Government would probably follow
            up this step with other measures which would logically flow from the granting of voting
            rights to the Berliners. While this development would not nullify the right of the three
            powers to be in military occupation of Berlin, which stems from the defeat of Germany,
            the exercise of the right could become legally precarious.</p>
                    <p>7. Viewed from the political point of view, the argument can be made that we can
            dispense with the legal formalities defining and arising out of Berlin's special status
            so long as an Allied military presence is maintained there. It is certainly true that
            this presence, not international <pb n="453" xml:id="pg_453" facs="0483"/>agreements, is
            the final deterrent against Communist encroachments. However, I believe that the crisis
            of 1958–62 demonstrated the great value of maintaining the integrity of our legal
            position. In their November 1958 “free city” proposal, the Soviets took pains to attempt
            to demonstrate to world opinion that they were promoting a reasonable solution to West
            Berlin's anomalous situation, based on allegedly defunct Quadripartitie agreements. Our
            ability to rebut this latter line helped much to expose the falseness of the Soviet
            rationalization and the aggressiveness of Moscow's intentions.</p>
                    <p>8. The same is true with respect to access by the three Allies and the German
            population to Berlin. The right of the Allies to unrestricted access to Berlin is an
            essential corollary to their right of occupation. The Soviets however may contend that
            the arrangements concluded to enable the Allies to exercise this right were affected by
            the abolition of the separate status of Berlin. A blurring of the status of Berlin would
            work to their advantage if they chose again to make access dependent on <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> permission.</p>
                    <p>9. I would emphasize that such an effort on the part of the Soviets is, in the
            Embassy's view, not to be expected as an immediate result of the granting of voting
            rights. The immediate Soviet response would probably be more in the nature of propaganda
            than of action. The Soviets show no inclination at present to rock the boat in Berlin
            and would probably confine their reaction to protests and to the final incorporation of
            East Berlin into the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> administration. (They might
            also further stiffen their opposition to the inclusion of a Berlin clause in
            international agreements.) Even so, retaliatory harassment of access routes is obviously
            within Communist capabilities, and so we cannot exclude this possibility from any
            assessment of consequences.</p>
                    <p>10. A further consideration which causes me concern pertains as much to the Germans as
            to the Soviets. If the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> increasingly assumes de facto
            governing responsibilities in Berlin, we could find ourselves in the future in the
            unenviable position of having formal responsibility for the security of Berlin but
            without having all the control strings firmly in our hands. For example, the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> quite probably would undertake more frequent Bundestag
            meetings in Berlin if the Allies were not in a position to exercise restraints. The
            Bundeswehr logically could be expected to assume a role in Berlin. We would, of course,
            still be expected to resist Communist countermeasures. Similarly the Berlin Senat would
            accept a larger and more active Soviet presence in West Berlin if Allied control should
            weaken. Again the Allies would have to face the consequences. Given the potential
            dangers of any Berlin confrontation, this is obviously a situation we would want to
            avoid.</p>
                    <p>11. Looked at from the Allied point of view in Berlin, the desirability of keeping
            intact the present status of Berlin's voting rights is evident <pb n="454" xml:id="pg_454" facs="0484"/>from the foregoing. But we must also recognize that a
            Federal Government in which the Social Democrats participate will be less likely to go
            along with this position than previous Federal Governments have been. The question
            therefore will arise whether in the light of our over-all relations with the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> we can or should maintain a position which the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> will consider outmoded and (by the Socialists)
            discriminatory. Given a determined stand by a German Government to alter the status quo,
            we would probably have to make the best of a bad situation by acquiescing in the move.
            Continued resistance on the part of the three Allies could seriously strain our
            relations with the new government and—in the end—might be fruitless.</p>
                    <p>12. These considerations have guided our contingency planning so far. The three Allies
            in consultation here agree that their position under present circumstances has been made
            clear and, consequently, there is no need for further action or statements at this time.
            If, despite the Allied stand, the Germans proceeded to count the Berlin votes in the
            nomination of a Chancellor, the three Embassies would not contest the move but would
            issue a public statement to the effect that our rights in Berlin are unaffected, and
            make a confidential démarche to the new government pointing to the pitfalls of this
            course of action. There is some disagreement, however, as to how strong this démarche
            should be. The British do not agree to a specific caution in this context against
            allowing the Berlin Delegates to vote on legislation. This is also the sense of the
            Department's current instructions to us (State 90602).<note n="4" xml:id="d186fn4">Telegram 90602, November 23, provided instructions regarding contingency planning for
              Berlin. (Department of State, Central Files, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 15–2
                <gloss target="#t_GER1">GER</gloss> W)</note> I believe that such a caution would be
            highly desirable. Without committing ourselves to any specific course of action we
            should send a grave warning as to the consequences of this next step, which <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> told us yesterday would surely follow.</p>
                    <p>13. This leads to the consideration of the second and—as I have indicated—more likely
            contingency, namely, that the new government will not count the Berlin votes in naming a
            new Chancellor but will move at some later date to adopt a law validating the Berlin
            votes for substantive legislation. The new government would, I believe, approach the
            Allies before embarking on such a course but might well couch this approach as a
            decision about to be taken—rather than a request for approval. To cope with this
            possibility I believe we should seek agreement with the British and French to approach
            the <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss>—presumably to be headed by Brandt—shortly
            after the formation of the new government. The three Allies would take note of Brandt's
            previously expressed wish for consultations and of statements by <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> spokesmen indicating an intent to initiate new legislation to validate
            the Berlin votes. Without threatening, <pb n="455" xml:id="pg_455" facs="0485"/>we would
            say that we oppose such a step for reasons which we would outline and that if it is
            taken unilaterally we would have to have a second look at our Berlin obligations. At the
            same time, in the spirit of consulting, we would state that we are prepared to consider
            the views of the German Govt if they wish to present them.</p>
                    <p>14. Such a démarche might have the effect of checking a German initiative before it
            became entrenched. Since we would preserve our freedom of action, we would reserve for
            the time our final decision in the light of the developing circumstances, including the
            degree of cooperation shown by the new government and the Senat in Berlin affairs and
            the attitudes of our British and French Allies.</p>

                    <p>6936. Subj: Meeting with Brandt.</p>
                    <p>1. I called on ForMin Brandt today at his request. This was his first official day at
            the <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> and I was his first visitor. He had come
            into the office only briefly yesterday and had met with the Ambassadors at a reception
            this morning. Brandt received me cordially and warmly reciprocated my expression of
            pleasure, personally and on behalf of my govt, in working with him in his new capacity.
            He appreciated Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>'s message and looked
            forward to seeing him in Paris on Wednesday and Thursday of next week—also at the
            Quadripartite dinner. He was sorry that he could not meet him on Tuesday, as the
            Secretary had suggested, however, he was detained in Bonn by the Chancellor's statement
            of policy to the Bundestag.</p>
                    <p>2. Brandt then made a brief statement of the new government's foreign policy. He hoped
            that we would take it for granted that they reaffirm Germany's traditional friendship
            with and confidence in the U.S. They hope to add to what has been accomplished together
            in the past. There had been problems, particularly in the area now under discussion by
            the Trilateral Commission, however, he understands that progress is being made. There
            are a number of problems now facing the government which they look forward to discussing
            with us frankly, both in seeking advice and soliciting our ideas. He mentioned three
            particular objectives to which he attached priority:</p>
                    <p>(A) He was anxious to speed up the progress of the <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> Round so that its success could be assured.</p>
                    <p>(B) He was anxious to take up the problem of Eastern Europe, and to discuss it at an
            early date with the French.</p>
                    <p>(C) He hoped that progress could be made concerning the problem of Britain (presumably
            Britain's entry into the Common Market). He did not expect sensational changes to occur
            as the result of the government's efforts. However, he did hope to put more energy into
            the solution of key problems.</p>
                    <p>3. Brandt admitted that he was not too familiar with the detailed problems facing
              <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. However, he hoped to inform himself prior to
            the forthcoming Paris meeting. In his statement to the Bundestag, Chancellor Kiesinger
            will express the hope to see President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>.
            He will <pb n="457" xml:id="pg_457" facs="0487"/>not, however, make reference to
            statements the President has made in the past of his intention to come to Europe
            (presumably because it was related to <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s
            invitation). The new government will, of course, welcome the President if he does
            come.</p>
                    <p>4. I queried the <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> as to what new impulses the
            govt might add to German foreign policy. Brandt replied that the discussions on foreign
            policy between the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_CSU1">CSU</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss>, which had led to the formation
            of their coalition, revealed a high degree of common conviction on foreign policy, in
            particular, with respect to its presentation to the German people. The Germans need to
            be talked to as if they were grown up—as indeed they are. The government should not just
            say all is going well. The problems which Germany faces with the US and France must be
            explained to the people.</p>
                    <p>5. Brandt said that the new govt will attempt to make a new start with France. He did
            not know how far this would get. In his view the German-French Treaty had been more
            successful than <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> had been willing to
            admit. This has been particularly true in the business field. Indeed, the treaty itself
            is only a skeleton—which must be fleshed out. He was glad that PriMin <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> was going to Paris first, in connection with his
            talks on <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> entry into the Common Market. This will
            enable Germany to use the apparatus of the German-French Treaty to precipitate
            long-range discussions with France on the subject—perhaps not immediately but certainly
            during the latter part of next year. Brandt commented as an aside that he believed the
            US and France had the same views with respect to East-West relations.</p>
                    <p>6. Brandt said that the new government was still considering how to approach the
            nuclear problem. It is clear that Germany does not want ownership of nuclear weapons.
            They hope that non-proliferation can be worked out so that the legitimate interests of
            non-nuclear powers can be taken care of. The new government will not take up the
            so-called “hardware solution”.</p>
                    <p>7. Turning to all-German matters, Brandt said that both parties—the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_CSU1">CSU</gloss> as well as the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss>—were determined not to give up the legitimate aim of
            Germans to reunify themselves. They hope to develop technical instrumentalities to
            strengthen ties with the Eastern Zone in the humanitarian, cultural, scientific and
            economic fields. This would not, however, involve recognition.</p>
                    <p>8. It is not yet clear what the policy of the new govt will be toward Eastern Europe.
            He and the Chancellor agree that they should express the hope that the progress already
            made can be extended. They were prepared to normalize diplomatic relations if a formula
            could be found in accordance with German interests. They are, however, not yet ready to
            name particular countries in this connection. The Chancellor will, in his statement to
            the Bundestag, say something special about Poland and <pb n="458" xml:id="pg_458" facs="0488"/>Czechoslovakia, something going beyond the German peace note of March 25.
            It will, for example, be more specific than the peace note with respect to the Munich
            Agreement. At the same time, the government would make a gesture to the
            expellees—including a clear statement that the govt does not approve of their expulsion.
            The Chancellor's statement will not mention the Oder-Neisse Line, but will talk of
            Poland's future role in Europe.</p>
                    <p>It will show sympathy and understanding for Poland's suffering as a result of its
            divisions and its desire for security. The Chancellor will say that, in connection with
            a peace settlement, Germany will be prepared for solutions that will not “be easy for
            them.” No reference, however, will be made to the sacrificing of any specific vital
            interests—an indication will only be given of the general direction of German
            policy.</p>
                    <p>9. At this point I gave orally to Brandt, almost verbatim, the statement of policy
            which had been approved by the Dept (see State 98003 and Bonn 6525).<note n="2" xml:id="d188fn2">Telegram 6525 from Bonn, November 30, contained the text of a
              suggested statement of policy. (Ibid.) In telegram 98003, December 7, the Department
              of State gave its approval to the overall tone of the statement, suggesting a series
              of additions and modifications in the wording. (Department of State, Central Files,
                <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 1 <gloss target="#t_GER1">GER</gloss>
              W–US)</note> To this I added the US policy towards emergency legislation, namely, that
            we, the British and French hope that legislation will be passed which would permit the
            lapse of Allied reserve rights to act in an emergency. We would particularly welcome
            legislation covering the monitoring of post and telecommunications which would enable
            the Allies to relinquish the rights and responsibilities they are now exercising in this
            field.</p>
                    <p>10. In response, Brandt expressed appreciation for the fact that we had prepared such a
            statement and for the specific statement with respect to German reunification and
            Berlin. Brandt thereupon raised the question of Berlin voting rights. He did not wish to
            revert to statements that he had made before assuming his present responsibilities. He
            did, however, think that the Embassy statement on this issue could have been expressed
            in a different way. He now wished to discuss this whole question with us fully. As a
            result of my approach to StateSec <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> (see
            Embtel 6737),<note n="3" xml:id="d188fn3">Telegram 6737 from Bonn, December 5, reported
                <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName>'s discussions with German officials
              concerning voting rights. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 14 <gloss target="#t_GER1">GER</gloss> W)</note> he had “taken care of the Parliamentary
            initiative (of the <gloss target="#t_FDP1">FDP</gloss>).” “There would be no coup
            d'etat.” He assured me that, although he has issues to raise with us, they would in no
            way be directed against the rights of the Allies.</p>
                    <p>11. Brandt said that, as a matter of fact, he also wished to discuss with the Three
            Powers and the Senat a broader range of questions affecting Berlin, including its future
            economic situation. This was not with the <pb n="459" xml:id="pg_459" facs="0489"/>objective of seeking new aid for Berlin, but rather advice as to how the city should
            proceed as had been sought after the building of the Wall.</p>
                    <p>12. I assured Brandt that we would be glad to discuss the voting rights issue or any
            other Berlin issue at any time. The Secretary hoped in particular to discuss this with
            him when he saw him in Paris. I did not wish to go into the details of the recent role
            of the Allies in this connection. I felt sure that if there were time to explain the
            situation from our viewpoint he would agree that we had no alternative than to take the
            course we did. I stressed that what we had done was a result of Allied positions taken
            in capitals. We had not made a statement but had responded to questions after a
            situation had developed which we felt necessitated the affirmation of our position.</p>
                    <p>13. Brandt stated that the new govt will, of course, fulfill its offset obligation.
            Also, it will in its discussions in the Trilateral Commission, seek to clarify its
            budget problems. (There was no time to clarify whether he meant this with respect to the
            present or only future offsets.) He expressed appreciation for our interest in the
            problem of the “technological gap.” This will be appreciated by the <gloss target="#t_EconMin1">EconMin</gloss> Prof. <persName corresp="#p_SK6">Schiller</persName>. In the German presentation in Euratom with respect to the Polish
            proposal, they emphasized that the <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> did not
            wish to break up the European cooperation which has been developed under Euratom.
            However, they hoped an agreement could be worked out with <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>. Brandt expressed the intention of the govt to proceed with preparation
            of emergency legislation.<note n="4" xml:id="d188fn4">

              found.</note>
                        <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> Brandt, in a speech in Berlin on Dec 10 at an
            open meeting of the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss>, repeated twice for empasis: “I
            have myself in the past week been prevented from acting in Bonn as a result of a
            combination of legal sterility and political malice.” As indicated in reftel, while we
            have in accordance with existing instructions done nothing further, the British Amb
            became agitated over this issue and raised it today for tripartite decision so that the
            three Allies can speak to Brandt with a single voice when this issue is raised at the
            Quadripartite dinner in Paris on December 14.</p>
                    <p>2. Brandt is obviously still greatly piqued at the Allied position on this issue taken
            during the recent governmental negotiations, which had in his view the effect of
            blocking an <gloss target="#t_FDP1">FDP</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss>
            coalition which would have made him Chancellor. Almost all other political observers
            here believe, on the contrary, that this would not have been a feasible basis for a new
            govt in Bonn at that time. In any event I do not believe that Brandt's open attack on
            the Allies, in using such words, can go unchallenged. To do so would, I believe, invite
            trouble in the future—not only on this and other Berlin issues but in our relations with
            him as <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>. If he elects to believe that the
            Allies are more tractable under public attack, our troubles have just begun. It is
            obvious that he has not yet become accustomed to the fact that he is <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>, with the restraints on public speech which this
            position sometimes entails, and no longer Governing Mayor of Berlin for whom a major
            weapon has traditionally been an open appeal to public opinion.</p>
                    <p>3. Brandt's basic reasoning which was elaborated to me by Albertz on the evening of Dec
            3 in Berlin, appears to be that the voting rights reservation is outdated and that an
            agreement should be made at once of progressively permitting Berlin Deputies full voting
            rights. I believe it could well be pointed out in response to such reasoning that there
            are some who will argue that so is the maintenance of an Allied presence in defense of
            Berlin outdated (which is precisely the argument the Soviets began making in 1958). If
            this dangerous argument based on obsolescence were accepted, the point could be reached
            where the Allies would be forced to reexamine their responsibilities which entail the
            most direct <pb n="461" xml:id="pg_461" facs="0491"/>confrontation with the Soviet Union
            and ultimately the possibility of nuclear war.</p>
                    <p>4. As has been pointed out in previous tels we have sent on this subject, the demand
            that the restriction of voting rights be eliminated raises both the issues of Allied
            legal rights and Allied ability to control the situation involving the exercise of our
            responsibilities in Berlin. Of the two the latter may be perhaps more compelling than
            the former. If Berlin should become a political football, as we have seen it become in
            recent years in connection with the issue of Bundestag meetings in the city, a situation
            could arise wherein the Germans egged on by the political parties acting independently
            and not necessarily as a government could vie with each other in demonstrating the claim
            that Berlin is an integral part of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. It is only
            reasonable to recall in this connection the interference with civilian access and jet
            buzzings of the old Reichstag building which resulted from the last Bundestag meeting
            there. These incidents—which resulted from a meeting which was not necessary—could
            easily have resulted in a confrontation.</p>
                    <p>5. If, moreover, the Germans were to act unilaterally in defiance of expressed Allied
            wishes, this might well be interpreted as an example of rising German nationalism and
            determination to “go it alone” in achieving her postwar aims. This could be pointed out
            discreetly to Brandt.</p>
                    <p>6. The best argument, however, that could be used by the three Foreign Ministers in
            Paris, I believe, is as we have recommended in Bonn 6452<note n="3" xml:id="d189fn3">
                            <ref target="#d186">Document 186</ref>.</note> that if the Allies are faced with a
            fait accompli it might force them to have another look at their Berlin responsibilities.
            It could also be stated that there is good ground for holding that German action on
            voting rights without Allied consent would be illegal and in violation of the Paris
            Agreement of 1954, as approved by the Bundestag, and could be so declared by the
            Constitutional Court. Although we would not ourselves desire it, this could have the
            effect of calling into question the 1954 agreement itself.</p>
                    <p>7. Our preference would be to have someone else, hopefully the French, take the
            initiative with Brandt on this issue, as the British have done locally today. In the
            Quadripartite dinner, we should, I believe, show solidarity with the others and, if
            necessary, take the initiative ourselves as spokesman on a Three-Power basis. As part of
            such discussion, it would be well to ask Brandt precisely what he had in mind in the
            remarks he made on Dec 10 in Berlin.</p>

                    <p>7104. Subj: Relaxation of tensions in Central Europe. For the personal attention of the
            Secretary, Under Secretary and Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName>. This message was initiated during my visit with Amb. Gronouski in
            Warsaw and has been the subject of subsequent exchanges between us. It represents my
            views and those of Amb. Gronouski, based on draft studies in both Embassies, on how
            relations between Poland and the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> might be improved
            and the cause of European stability thus advanced. While certain revisions in this draft
            have been occasioned by the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> policy declaration,
            which was given subsequent to my latest consultations with Amb. Grounouski, I believe
            that this message corresponds to the substance agreed. He may, however, wish to make
            additional comments.</p>
                    <p>1. A resolution of the Central European security problem is essential to a lasting
            peace in Europe. A key to this resolution is the development of an improved relationship
            between Germany and Poland. Poland, of all the Eastern European countries, retains the
            greatest fear and distrust of Germany. Between the two countries there exist the most
            specific, unresolved conflicts remaining from World War II:</p>
                    <p>(A) The division of Germany and German determination to achieve reunification;</p>
                    <p>(B) The failure to achieve final agreement on the Western boundary of Poland;</p>
                    <p>(C) Poland's fear of German access to nuclear weapons;</p>
                    <p>(D) Poland's fear of a possible Soviet-West German deal which would result in
            reunification without resolving the security of its Western territories;</p>
                    <p>(E) Germany's fears of aggression by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> through
            and with the support of Poland; and</p>
                    <p>(F) The plight of the German minority in Poland.</p>
                    <p>2. The absence of diplomatic relations between the two countries is a factor resulting
            from and contributing to the prolongation of these conflicts. Only in the fields of
            trade, culture and in the exchange of persons has there been any concrete improvement in
            relations between Germany and Poland in recent years. However, even in these fields
            progress has been hobbled for political reasons.</p>
                    <p>3. The proposal: President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s October 7
            speech, particularly his remarks on German reunification and European boundaries, <pb n="463" xml:id="pg_463" facs="0493"/>opened the door to new ways of thinking and
            working towards a resolution of the Central European problem. Considering the conflicts
            listed above against the background of the President's speech, the best possibilities
            for improvement appear to lie in the following steps to be taken on German
            initiative:</p>
                    <p>(A) Announcement by Germany of its intention to accept the Oder-Neisse Line, this
            action to be legalized however only when German reunification is achieved in the context
            of a final peace settlement. Such a step would greatly reduce Poland's fear that Germany
            might attempt to seize the territory east of the Oder-Neisse by force. It would
            eliminate Polish dependence on the USSR as sole guarantor of the Polish territories east
            of the Oder-Neisse. By prior agreement, this action could also result in the
            establishment of Polish-German diplomatic relations.</p>
                    <p>(B) Concurrently with and supporting the action in (A), and as a consideration for a
            more liberal Polish policy permitting an increased rate of resettlement in Germany of
            Germans still living in Poland, Germany would renounce the claim of Heimatrecht (the
            right to return to one's homeland) for German expellees from Poland, except insofar as
            this can be achieved by a free negotiation with Poland. This would also make the
            acceptance of the Oder-Neisse boundary more acceptable to the Germans.</p>
                    <p>(C) At the next extension of the German-Polish trade agreement, increased levels of
            trade and credit terms more favorable for Poland would be negotiated.</p>
                    <p>4. German relations with Poland would, of course, also be greatly enhanced if Germany
            would adhere to a general non-proliferation agreement and would publicly renounce a
            hardware solution of the nuclear sharing problem, including a reiteration of its oft
            made denial of any intention to possess nuclear weapons. These issues arise, however,
            within a broader context and it must not be expected, therefore, that their resolution
            can be made to coincide with the other steps recommended herein.</p>
                    <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: (A) There is evidence that Poland may be willing to
            enter into diplomatic relations with Germany on the single condition that Germany
            recognize the Oder-Neisse Line. It is difficult politically for any German Government to
            do this until a peace treaty is achieved as stipulated in the Potsdam Agreement. Few
            Germans realistically expect to regain territory; nevertheless, many influential Germans
            feel that advance recognition of the Oder-Neisse boundary would cost them one of the few
            bargaining counters they have for reunification. The formula proposed in 3 (A) above
            might be acceptable to Poland and Germany as a compromise.</p>
                    <p>(B) The often but ambiguously expressed claim to Heimatrecht made by some Germans,
            particularly when linked with a subsequent <pb n="464" xml:id="pg_464" facs="0494"/>right to self-determination, is particularly offensive to Poland. Since the Germans
            have renounced the use of force, it is a claim which can be realized only through
            bilateral agreement. By renouncing the territory beyond the Oder-Neisse and Heimatrecht,
            the German Government would lose considerable support among expellees. This would,
            however, be offset somewhat by permitting greater freedom of movement of Germans to and
            from the Oder-Neisse territories (para 3 B).</p>
                    <p>(C) Since there is no real possibility for agreement at the present time on German
            reunification or—on the other side of the coin German recognition of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>—the Germans and Poles would ignore these points—agreeing
            to disagree. Although there is evidence that Poland will insist on <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> recognition of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> as
            a condition prior to eventual “normalization” of relations, it would not be required for
            the establishment of diplomatic relations.</p>
                    <p>(D) In his policy declaration before the Bundestag on December 13,<note n="2" xml:id="d190fn2">For extracts, see Documents on Germany, 1944–1985, pp.
              935–941.</note> Chancellor Kiesinger had the following to say about relations with
            Poland: “Large sectors of the German people very much want reconciliation with Poland
            whose sorrowful history we have not forgotten and whose desire ultimately to live in a
            territory with secure boundaries we now, in view of the present lot of our own divided
            people, understand better than in former times. But the boundaries of a reunified
            Germany can only be determined in a settlement freely agreed with an all-German
            government, a settlement that should establish the basis for a lasting and peaceful
            good-neighborly relationship agreed to by both nations.” The new govt thus continues to
            adhere to the position that settlement of the boundaries will have to await a peace
            treaty.</p>
                    <p>At the same time Kiesinger emphasized the desire for reconciliation with Poland—and
            expressed greater understanding for Poland's desire for secure borders. This could
            conceivably lead to a decision by the govt to grant—as proposed in (3)—what is
            essentially de facto recognition of the existing borders to be followed, upon a final
            settlement, by de jure acceptance.</p>
                    <p>(E) Tact and patience will be required in dealing with the Germans on this issue,
            however, I am inclined to believe that the present grand coalition may offer better
            prospects than the previous govt for tangible progress toward a German-Polish
            settlement. For one thing, it can make certain concessions without fear of exploitation
            by a major rival party. Moreover, the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> has been a
            consistent proponent of a more flexible Eastern and nuclear policy. While not explicitly
            endorsing the recognition of the Oder-Neisse Line, a number of speakers at the June 1966
            Party Congress—including <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> Brandt—hinted that
            Germany must reconcile <pb n="465" xml:id="pg_465" facs="0495"/>itself to the loss of
            the territory east of the Line. (Brandt said: “Many people act as though we have the
            territories east of the Oder-Neisse. They also act as though friendly states had
            committed themselves to mere legal reservations, when in fact some had not even done
            that … therefore our demand for working out the basic elements of a peace treaty
            settlement.”)</p>
                    <p>(F) The new German Govt has stated that it seeks “neither national ownership nor
            national control of nuclear weapons.” While vague, this language would not rule out the
            type of development foreseen in para 3.</p>
                    <p>6. Tactics: (A) The US is not believed to be in a position either openly or officially
            to propose the course of action described in paras 3 and 4. To do so might put the
            German Govt on the defensive, and would represent an assumption of responsibility for
            Germany's future which we are in no position to take.</p>
                    <p>(B) I propose, however, that I be authorized to suggest such a course privately to
            Chancellor Kiesinger and <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> Brandt. I would
            propose to do so in separate personal conversations with each—“unter vier Augen”—on an
            appropriate occasion. I would present the ideas expressed in this telegram both as a
            personal reaction from my trip to Poland, and as steps which I knew the US Government
            would approve and, when appropriate, support.</p>
                    <p>(C) In stating the case, I would congratulate them on the forward-looking approach they
            are taking toward all the East European countries. I would express the hope that the
            Federal Republic will be able to make progress in improving its relations with all the
            countries of East Europe, not just Poland. I would avoid any definition of what I
            understood the Oder-Neisse Line to cover. There would be no suggestion that Poland need
            be the first country tackled or that German initiatives should be limited to Poland.
            Indeed, once Germany has decided to breech the Hallstein Doctrine, Romania, which
            demands no conditions, may be the most logical country to begin with.</p>
                    <p>(D) Amb. Gronouski would seek to encourage and guide the Polish Government's response
            to any German initiative along these lines—as appropriate.</p>

                    <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve de Murville</persName>, as host,
            opened the meeting by welcoming Brandt as the newest member of the group and asking him
            to begin. Brandt began by saying that he wished to discuss “the German Problem.” He was
            interrupted by <persName corresp="#p_BG4">Brown</persName>, who objected to the term,
            “German Problem,” saying it was rather a “European problem.” Brandt, nevertheless,
            continued saying that he had been at a similar meeting eight years ago “in this house”
            after the <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> ultimatum,<note n="3" xml:id="d191fn3">Reference is to <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>'s
              November 10, 1958, speech and the subsequent Soviet note to the Western powers
              regarding the status of Berlin. For texts of these documents and of the Four-Power
              response, December 14, 1958, see Documents on Germany, 1944–1985, pp. 542–546 and
              552–560.</note> when, after he had made his presentation on Berlin and was dismissed,
            Dulles took his hand and told him not to be worried—the allies would not let him or
            Berlin down.</p>
                    <p>He reminded the group that these gatherings related to the responsibilities that the
            three powers have in Germany as a whole to which “they were kind enough to invite the
            German Foreign Minister.” He added that he saw no sign that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> was more willing today than last year or even the year before that to
            discuss the German problem, i.e., reunification.</p>
                    <pb n="467" xml:id="pg_467" facs="0497"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BG4">Brown</persName> interrupted at that point saying that if
            that was the German problem, then it was not a German problem but a wider European one.
            Brandt said that if reunification was not the German problem, it was certainly the heart
            of the matter. Brown asked what his “priorities” were, and Brandt answered that he would
            come to that. In considering the German problem, Brandt continued, the Russians
            concentrate on three difficult questions: (a) German possession of, or access to,
            nuclear weapons; (b) the question of frontiers; and (c) recognition of the Soviet Zone.
            Nevertheless, there still may be useful areas of discussion on subjects besides trade
            and culture. There may even be limited areas of discussion with the Soviets on security
            matters. In this connection, he mentioned the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>'s
            “Peace Note” of March 25, 1966, which contained offers to exchange declarations on the
            non-use of force with Eastern European states. He suggested (without elaboration) the
            possibility of somehow including the problem of divided Germany in such a
            declaration.</p>
                    <p>Brandt had the impression that there was a distinct difference in attitude and behavior
            between the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the East Zone authorities toward
            Berlin. Soviet representatives in East Berlin seemed to feel that broader Soviet
            interests made it desirable not to have trouble in Berlin. The recent decrease of
            shootings on the Wall, and lack of other provocations, were attributable to Soviet
            pressure on the East German authorities. Furthermore, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> was now more willing to accept Berlin “into trade and other
            arrangements” linking Berlin and the Federal Republic.</p>
                    <p>Brandt, therefore, wanted to talk with the “Three” in Bonn on new plans for West
            Berlin. He wanted their “political advice” the same way as Berlin had needed allied
            advice in setting up the “viability program.” He stressed that he was seeking political
            advice and not economic aid. If there were no Soviet interference with Berlin for a
            certain period, then new plans might be formulated for Berlin to bring the city into
            West Germany's “context, with other parts of Europe.”</p>
                    <p>Brandt said he would not raise Berlin voting rights, noting that the question was now
            before a Bundestag committee. It was not a good idea “to mix up the rights of the Three
            with the rights of the Sovereign Parliament.” Nothing would be done in this area without
            prior consultation with the allies. Discussion might take a year or two.</p>
                    <p>Brandt again contrasted Soviet behavior with that of the East German authorities,
            saying that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> was at least interested in doing
            something in the humanitarian field. As an illustration, Brandt mentioned a special
            office (not further identified) that had been reopened in Berlin (apparently under
            Soviet pressure) that permitted persons with emergency family situations to pass quickly
            into the Zone.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, Brandt admitted that there was no agreement this year on Christmas
            passes for Berliners. Nevertheless he thought that this would not create unreasonable
            problems for the people of Berlin. On <pb n="468" xml:id="pg_468" facs="0498"/>the
            whole, the pass program had worked, and had made it possible for 5.5 million individual
            visits to date.</p>
                    <p>The Soviets were not interfering very seriously with <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> efforts to normalize relations with Eastern Europe. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> was trying, however, to push the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> into recognizing the East Zone, and the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> in turn wanted to prevent normalization of FRG relations
            with Eastern European states.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">2) <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> Internal Situation and
            Relations with the Zone</p>
                    <p>Brandt said he had little to add beyond what is generally known on the internal
            situation in East Germany. Economic programs are developing despite severe trade
            conditions imposed on the Zone by the Soviet Union. Nevertheless, he said, the East
            German managerial class worked hard to fulfill their trade obligations to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in the hope of being able thereby to develop additional
            Western trade.</p>
                    <p>The Germans now may have reached the point where they would have to differentiate
            between the East German regime and the population of the area. It cannot be in the
            German interest to insist on isolating these people. True, there were problems even in
            trade and cultural exchanges. There were, of course, more serious problems in any
            efforts that were tinged with politics. The abortive attempt at an <gloss target="#t_SED1">SED</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> speaker exchange of
            last year was an example. As for the Zone's own policy, Brandt noted that the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> was no longer pushing the confederation idea; on the
            contrary, it had been dropped on the ostensible grounds that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> was unworthy.</p>
                    <p>Actually, Brandt thought that we would have a clearer idea of East German attitudes
            after the <gloss target="#t_SED1">SED</gloss> Party Congress in March. Reports from the
            Zone did not suggest any clear picture as to who might emerge as <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>'s successor. The Zone, like the FRG, has a
            “problem of generations,” but not perhaps in the classical sense—the new generation in
            the Zone was developing, surprisingly enough, not necessarily a commitment to the
            Communist system but rather a sense of identification with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> qua state.</p>
                    <p>The approach of the new (Federal) German Government, Brandt said, was not to think that
            reunification had first priority and therefore not to use the word quite as often. He
            did not wish to suggest to the German people that reunification was just around the
            corner. This meant modified language in public statements and greater concentration on
            personal links in a divided country through science, cultural efforts, trade and sports.
            The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> intended to create an office for intra-German
            problems in Bonn. Perhaps a similar office might be established in the Zone. (He did not
            indicate how such an office would relate to the existing Ministry of All-German
            Affairs.)</p>
                    <pb n="469" xml:id="pg_469" facs="0499"/>
                    <p>On trade, Brandt noted that “certain <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> countries” had
            bypassed the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> in the volume of trade with and the
            value of credits to the Soviet Zone. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> would not
            fall behind, and would compete on the same basis as the Allies with trade and credits.
            It was difficult, he said, for the electrical workers in West Berlin to understand why
            they could not compete with Western financed plants in the Eastern part of the City. He
            also mentioned a plan, on which he did not elaborate, about developing a system of
            “travellers checks” which would have the effect of equalizing the currencies in
            Germany.</p>
                    <p>On recognition, the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> would “go on as before”—they
            would not recognize the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, but below that level, the
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> would go “beyond where we are up to now in dealing
            with the regime in Pankow.” What the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> aimed at was
            “organized togetherness” for the German people which in turn contributed to internal
            German and, by extension, to European détente. Naturally the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> would resist this process and, for this reason, the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> would be grateful if the three powers would “underline
            previously taken positions” (presumably on self-determination) and support and
            understand <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> efforts to counteract the effects of an
            artificial division on the German people.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked if the links which might open up with the Zone were being thought
            of as intra-German activities only or open to others as well. He foresaw problems if
            other European states or the US were to participate.</p>
                    <p>Brandt replied that since these activities would be “on German soil” (except for
            commercial links) it would make sense if the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> were
            given a “certain chance” before the scene were opened to others.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> said he was struck by Brandt's remarks
            about differences in the attitudes of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the
            Soviet Zone, i.e., that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> appeared more inclined
            to a relaxation of tensions than the East Germans. He added that Brandt's plans for
            developing economic, personal and human relations were more the responsibility of the
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> than of Europe and the US. “You must lead the
            way,” he said. He added that, without having examined Brandt's proposal in detail, “we
            agree and have no objection.” He said, however, that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> was nevertheless responsible, being after all the party most directly
            concerned.</p>
                    <p>Throughout the above exchange and thereafter, <persName corresp="#p_BG4">Brown</persName> made spirited interruptions saying there was too much talk about
            Berlin. He took Brandt to task for continuing to sound too much like the Governing Mayor
            of Berlin rather than the Foreign Minister of a country with wider problems. He drew a
            parallel between Brandt's recent appointment as Foreign Minister and his own, and
            between their common positions as “socialist ministers” and, by implication, their
            relative weight and size vis-à-vis the great powers. Berlin, he said, did not dictate
            issues; it did not “stage the stage.” Berlin was “subsumed “ in problems of wider
            scope.</p>
                    <pb n="470" xml:id="pg_470" facs="0500"/>
                    <p>Brandt did not agree. He pointed out that the purpose of the evening was to discuss
            Germany, and that divided Berlin was after all a microcosm of divided Germany. <persName corresp="#p_BG4">Brown</persName> nevertheless kept returning to what he called the
            “wider responsibilities” that Brandt had as Foreign Minister—East-West relations,
            relations with the US and France, and the Asian world. In making his remarks, <persName corresp="#p_BG4">Brown</persName> spoke rather colorfully, returning again and again
            to the point that what Brandt was talking about was a wider European problem and not a
            German one, often addressing Brandt as “my dear Willy” and admitting that he was taking
            this line against the advice of his staff there present.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCE2">Bohlen</persName> and others
            tried to pin <persName corresp="#p_BG4">Brown</persName> down on what he meant, without
            any real success. Brandt defended his position by citing examples from his own
            experience about the utility of tending to the work on hand. In this context he
            mentioned one of his predecessors, Mayor Ernst Reuter, who said in a meeting wherein
            grandiose plans for international relations were presented, that the principal problem
            was to maintain Berlin's trolley cars and get them painted. Brandt added that the German
            contribution to limited détente might be reasonable relations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, better relations with Eastern Europe and moves to keep
            “our people together.” <persName corresp="#p_BG4">Brown</persName> countered that it
            might be better to “take it easy.” He thought poorly of spending “shillings” until it
            had been seen whether “pence” would do.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked if the moves toward the people of the Zone that Brandt suggested or
            British support therefor could hurt <persName corresp="#p_BG4">Brown</persName> in
            Parliament. <persName corresp="#p_BG4">Brown</persName> said yes. <persName corresp="#p_BG4">Brown</persName> turned again to the question of “wider
            responsibilities” and in broad terms appeared reluctant to become involved in German
            specifics, mentioning Viet-Nam as another situation into which others could be
            dragged.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary remarked that as far as Viet-Nam was concerned, he did not wish to
            belabor the point but Britain's treaty obligations were as clear and binding as those of
            the United States.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BG4">Brown</persName> again turned to his argument that there was
            not really a German but rather a “European” problem, saying that the Germans were in one
            sense a victim of the division of Europe which had been imposed by the Allies. To this
            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCE2">Bohlen</persName> replied that it was hardly “the
            Allies” but rather the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> that was responsible.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary stressed that it was not just a European problem. He reminded <persName corresp="#p_BG4">Brown</persName> that the US was involved in Europe, mentioning the
              US/<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> confrontation in Europe, and specifically
            that Germany was the one place where the US and Soviet Union might conceivably go to
            war. Therefore it was not a “European” problem. The Secretary added, by way of
            illustration, that our heaviest commitments in terms of total outlay have been made in
            this area and that the US was therefore very <pb n="471" xml:id="pg_471" facs="0501"/>much involved. We could not be excluded; therefore, it was not just a European
            problem.</p>
                    <p>Immediately following Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>'s departure,
            and as <persName corresp="#p_BG4">Brown</persName> was leaving, the latter asked that
            participants make no statement to the press. <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> demurred. <persName corresp="#p_BG4">Brown</persName> said that we
            should only say that “European problems” were talked about. Brandt with considerable
            emotion said that he could not report to the Bundestag that the talk at dinner had been
            confined to the “European problem” but that he must indicate that the participants, in
            the tradition of Quadripartite dinners, had talked about Germany. Brandt, <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BG4">Brown</persName>
            then appeared to agree that they would say that talks had related to Europe and
            Germany.</p>

                    <p>7249. Pass White House. Subj: Establishment of Presidential Contact with Chancellor
            Kiesinger.</p>
                    <p>1. I consider it highly desirable that a direct relationship be established as soon as
            possible between the President and Chancellor Kiesinger. This is particularly important
            in view of continuing inaccurate suggestions, originating in the US press and picked up
            here, that the President is reluctant to meet with Kiesinger because of the latter's
            former Nazi Party membership and overtures to the French. We have already taken steps
            directly with the Chancellor's office to counter such reports, but Kiesinger himself may
            still be uncertain as to the President's attitude toward him personally and may be
            waiting for a signal.</p>
                    <p>2. Under the circumstances, I recommend that I be authorized to call on the Chancellor
            and transmit to him orally a message from the President along the following lines:</p>
                    <p>A. The President congratulates the Chancellor on the policy declaration which he
            delivered in the Bundestag on Dec. 13 which he found most impressive. The President
            naturally took a special interest in the passage concerning German relations with the
            United States, and wishes <pb n="472" xml:id="pg_472" facs="0502"/>to express to the
            Chancellor our sincere appreciation for these generous and encouraging remarks. The
            President can assure the Chancellor that they are fully reciprocated on the American
            side. Through close and frequent contact, the Chancellor and the President can ensure
            that there will be continuing trust between the Federal Republic and the United States
            and that both countries will, in the Chancellor's words, “understand and consider each
            other's vital interests.” We have full confidence in the Chancellor's leadership.</p>
                    <p>B. As the Chancellor is aware, the President has expressed the hope that he would be
            able to visit Europe during the spring. If such a trip turns out to be possible he
            naturally would wish to include the Federal Republic. Plans for the trip have not yet
            been developed, however, and will inevitably depend on developments in America and
            elsewhere in the world during the next months.</p>
                    <p>C. The President wishes the Chancellor to know that, for his part, he would be very
            happy to welcome the Chancellor to Washington whenever the Chancellor considers it would
            fit in with his planned State visits.</p>
                    <p>3. I believe that such an approach would open the line of communication between the
            President and the Chancellor and would clearly indicate—before the Chancellor visits
              <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> on January 13—that the President and
            the American government are well disposed toward him and his Cabinet. I shall be
            returning to Washington on leave on December 21. I would, of course, point this out to
            the Chancellor, which would permit him to send a personal message to the President if he
            desires. Because of the short time available, I would appreciate urgent consideration of
            this recommendation in the Department and the White House.<note n="2" xml:id="d192fn2">In telegram 104567 to Bonn, December 16, the Department of State informed <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> that it believed a letter from the President

              Berlin office in Bonn. Was with them for about 3 hours (7 to 10 P.M.) An S.P.D. member
              of the Bundestag, Seydak (who may only have been a party official) was also
              present.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>I told Brandt I was anxious to get from him his conception of the direction of the new
            government in foreign affairs. I have talked with the new Chancellor and with the new
            Finance Minister and I was particularly interested in the views of the new Foreign
            Minister.</p>
                    <p>I told him that I had been asked to talk to them about the new direction of the
            government and also to learn their views of the correct direction of United States
            policy in respect to Germany.</p>
                    <p>Brandt was expecting me to talk about balance of payments. I told him this was an
            important but incidental matter, important but far less so than the direction of Europe
            and the relation of the United States to it.</p>
                    <p>The talk of “change” was in the air and it was necessary to know what really was
            changing and what the implications were for the security of the Free World.</p>
                    <p>He started out by saying that in the past German emphasis had been on reunification.
            That had been the inspiration of German policy. The main orientation now is, what can
            Germany do for peace of the world. Everything must be put in relation to this without
            giving up Germany's ultimate legitimate aims, i.e., reunification. Soviets must lose
            their fear of Germany if reunification is ever to come about. We must find the formula
            by which peace is preserved—peace on a permanent basis.</p>
                    <p>Germany had been concerned too much with its own worries and preoccupations and had not
            been as conscious or as sympathetic as it should have been over the concerns and
            troubles of others, particularly the United States. Reunification is not in the
            foreseeable future. <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> has been the security
            framework but within this framework now Europe had to be brought together. It was a slow
            process but a necessary one—contradictional in many of its aspects but it had to be
            accomplished. Young people needed confidence in future and they had to have new
            direction. As nothing can be done with Europe without France, one has to deal with
            France and <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> is France at the moment. We
            cannot give France a new government and so we have to deal with him. We <pb n="474" xml:id="pg_474" facs="0504"/>shall never have the Europe which is ultimately desirable
            while he is head of France because his concept is leadership of France in Europe with a
            secondary position for everybody else. People are disillusioned regarding reunification
            and the lack of progress of integration of Europe economically and politically but we
            must make progress in what direction we can; and so Germany has determined to see what
            can be done on a bilateral basis. He saw De Gaulle day before yesterday—cordial—talked
            for an hour. Brandt had felt it possible to work out common policies with France,
            technological problems, common market, common policies for Europe, etc. Found <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> not so much interested in this any more. Now it
            was the East-West issue which absorbed him. Whereas before this, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> had always expressed anti-American sentiments
            to him, this time there was “almost no such references.” Quite evidently, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> thought that the major development was now to
            be the entente with the Soviet Union, deep significance of <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> visit and those to come after. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName> had met with <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and Brandt
            had impression meeting was not unpleasant.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> believed no threat from Soviet Union
            for time being—possibilities of renewed threat not excluded for the future. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> had referred to United States troops on
            Germany's territory. Had no objection to this—indeed, was quite satisfied with their
            presence there. He simply did not want them on French soil and they served the purpose
            where they were. Soviet Union much preoccupied with China and internal problems and way
            is now open to discuss things with Soviet Union—trade, culture—can't really discuss
            reunification now. Brandt was contemplating and <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName> was urging entering into an agreement renouncing all use of force in
            connection with solution of the German problem. Formal document. Make it appear as a
            significant document or treaty of far-reaching importance. This might help “normalize”
            relations which they had in mind. They wished to have diplomatic relations with
            satellites. Poland would prove difficult. All this is in line with President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s October 7th speech as <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve de Murville</persName> was careful to point out. It was not
            possible to mention “Oder Neisse” line at this time but they had gone as far as possible
            in the Chancellor's statement. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> had said
            to <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> that reunification of Germany was a
            historical necessity though nothing to be done about it now. Maybe the issue of Sudetens
            could be included in the agreement but this was already so clearly renounced that it no
            longer had any significance. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> surprised
            him by referring to the need for a renunciation of an Anschluss with Austria Of course,
            no one was interested in this but it might be useful vis-à-vis Soviet Union. There are
            limited moves one can make and we intend to study what these moves can be. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> had said no longer interested in military
            matters or strategy. French troops in Germany on the proper basis—experts can take care
            of trade, military technological matters. “We can deal with the fundamentals”, i.e.,
            East-West.</p>
                    <pb n="475" xml:id="pg_475" facs="0505"/>
                    <p>Brandt and <persName corresp="#p_WH6">Wehner</persName> were impressed by the
            proclamation Monnet was now working on in regard to Europe. S.P.D. would support it.
            British would certainly be blocked unless <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName> could be convinced that Britain's financial problems solved and
            honestly accepted full obligations of Rome. Had to deal with France. Brandt said that he
            had made it clear that Germans adhered to concept of integrated defense. “<persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> did not object”. Brandt said the Germans were
            going to do what they could to improve military planning but did not know how far
              <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> would be prepared to go. Mainly
            interested in the Moscow-Paris axis.</p>
                    <p>Germans were in a confused position . “We are the only one all of whose forces are in
              <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.” Till recently all wanted Germany to do more in
            military field. Now suggestion is we should do less; still fear of German rearmament.
            Must restore confidence. This is the value of the renunciation agreement.</p>
                    <p>As for United States force levels—most dangerous if important changes took place
            now—must not relate such action to money. This had created a very bad impression—the
            package approach was a major mistake—created doubts about the Alliance. Hastened the
            fall of the Erhard Government. No steps regarding forces should be taken which do not
            come about as a result of community decisions—must be a rational evolution subscribed to
            by all—not unilateral. Alliance has suffered a set back. Must be reinvigorated. United
            States should not gain the impression that there was a basic change in German policies.
            Geography and experience dictate the need for accommodation with France. He found a
            recent statement given him by <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> helpful in
            that it made clear State Department's desire for good Franco-German relations. Germany's
            economic situation probably improving this fall but growth rate of 4% impossible. Need
            to bring order into finance. Should no longer make the defense budget a savings account
            for social legislation as it had been. Whatever was needed for defense should be voted
            and spent. (cf. <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName>)</p>
                    <p>Belgians had made an interesting suggestion in Paris—all say things have
            changed—appoint a committee to examine into just what has changed and what is the value
            of the change.</p>
                    <p>When I asked Willy whether he had the impression that the United States had attempted
            to dominate or bring too much influence to bear on German policy, he said definitely
            not, except in some aspects of the military field. If anything, he felt United States
            had not been as closely interested in German policy matters as might have been wished.
            At one time there had been a common discussion of problems—example of old days in
            Berlin, etc. Now the impression was one of some aloofness and oversensitivity in regard
            to undue influence. What was needed was close frank collaboration on all matters which
            affected Germany. He said he was pleased that <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>
            had referred to the non-proliferation treaty language <pb n="476" xml:id="pg_476" facs="0506"/>when he had been in Paris.<note n="2" xml:id="d193fn2">December 12.
              Reported in telegram Secto 16 from Paris, December 13. (Department of State,
              Conference Files: Lot 68 D 453, CF 248)</note> His view was that Germany did not want
            to create any difficulties over non-proliferation. People had come to believe it was a
            step toward peace and momentum of opinion is in favor of it. No place therefore for
            Germany to stand in way, although its significance may be considerably less than claimed
            for it. Where Germany raised questions it would be on basis of interest of all
            non-nuclear powers not particularly Germany alone. On the European option he was not so
            concerned. Impossible to bind a new European community any way—simply not bound by
            treaty's terms. Of course, if such a European political entity was favored it would have
            to have nuclear power. Important thing is what goes on within Alliance as it is;
              <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> committee, disarmament questions.
            When I raised the question of the confederation with France which Strauss spoke of, he
            said he did not agree with Strauss on this point. He said his concern was to save De
            Gaulle and France from the German Gaullists. They were dangerous and most reactionary in
            their thinking. No accident that many rightist elements in Germany are Gaullists.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_WH6">Wehner</persName> added some remarks. Important for everyone
            to realize with all the talk of French rapprochement Europe is only possible within the
            concept of American partnership. We should try to find the small “auslege” with the
            French but never lose sight of the fact that these were interior matters and are not
            part of the larger waters. Germany needs a little “spielraum” within which to operate
            with France and the East but it must all be within the basic commitments. <persName corresp="#p_WH6">Wehner</persName> said he had learned to become pro-American out of
            discipline—simply because there was no other way. Had not been exactly seduced by the
            Americans over the years but he was a pro-American. Kiesinger had done well to speak of
            France as America's oldest ally.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> was not able to establish good relations
            with either France, Britain or United States—too bad because he had made real
            contribution to the country. Now the new government was going to do this. It had
            authority which <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> lacked. The S.P.D. had
            supported Schroeder and the M.L.F. and the <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> test ban. Impression created that United States interest in these
            things had disappeared after Germany had been committed. Too easy an acceptance of
            United States point of view. New government will be more satisfactory to deal with than
            the obsequious Hassel. Can operate on a broader basis.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_WH6">Wehner</persName> said United States should emphasize closer
            collaboration. He complained that American Ambassador had not seen him since the
            Ambassador's arrival until just the other day when he was made a Minister.<note n="3" xml:id="d193fn3">

            United States not having seduced him made me feel he is very sensitive in regard to his
            position. He has been operating in the shadows for so long due to his old communist
            record and the brilliance of Erler that he is now enjoying the sun. He seeks and expects
            recognition and one should be aware of this if he visits the United States.)</p>
                    <p>Both of them thought a visit by the President to Germany would be helpful if not too
            long postponed. However, it should be carefully thought out and some concrete results
            should accompany the conclusion of the visit. Perhaps some things in regard to space or
            technology. He rather thought Kiesinger should visit the United States first. Visit
            should be not for show but for business—serious attempt should be made to re-create
            confidence in United States leadership.</p>
                    <p>I had seen Brandt on the T.V. when he addressed the Bundestag after his return from
            Paris. It was too effusive and too obviously directed toward a make-up with France and a
            tactful detachment from the United States. I said that I wanted to say a few things: the
            strong emphasis on the overthrow of the old government because it had been too much
            under the influence of the United States, the rush to Paris, the tone of his talk was
            not the attitude of a foreign minister sure of himself as an equal partner in an
            Alliance. I said I was fearful of the result of all this Lili Marlene love affair. He
            should recall that it was only a few days before his “embracio” of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> that <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>'s red carpet
            guest, had used French soil from which to deliver vicious attacks on his country and my
            country—two allies of France. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> must have
            been apprized of these attacks beforehand.</p>
                    <p>When I recently saw Senator <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> he had
            talked to me about the Europeans not wanting United States troops and that we had better
            get out if this was their attitude. I complained that he was mistakenly relating French
            attitudes to the rest of Europe. I was now fearful that all this rather ostentatious
            display toward France on the part of Germany when France had hardly acted as a loyal
            ally of the United States either in respect of Viet Nam or in the manner it had left
              <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, would tend to justify the Senator's appraisal
            and that a large body of United States opinion would be saying “a plague on both your
            houses”, with the result that both <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> and
            Moscow would suddenly find they had with Germany's assistance accomplished their
            respective wishes for the detachment of the United States and its interests from Europe.
            I am sure this sobered him up. I believe it was well to say it if only to moderate the
            emotional transports which Bonn and Brandt are now undergoing in the way of “off with
            the old, on with the new.”</p>
                    <pb n="478" xml:id="pg_478" facs="0508"/>
                    <p>I said that he must always keep in mind that it was not the United States which was
            demanding a choice between Washington and Paris. It was France only that demanded Paris.
            Germany did not have to decide between <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>
            and <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> or France and the United States. What
            Germany did have to decide was between a collective approach to security with all that
            it meant and an individual independent approach based on axes and all the other
            paraphanalia of the pre-war era which <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>
            had re-introduced. This was fundamental for there was no place for the United States in
            Europe on any basis except a collective basis. We could not put our troops in Germany on
            the same basis that France now demanded hers. It was going to require high statesmanship
            for Germany to play these two roles—embracement of France and adherence to collective
            policies hostile to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>. It would prove to
            be a difficult role to play in Europe and an even more difficult one to play in front of
            United States public opinion.</p>
                    <p>I asked Brandt what role the offset problem and the failure of <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s visit to the United States had played in his
            downfall. He said it had undoubtedly accelerated it but it would probably have occurred
            later on without this development. There is no doubt now in my mind that this is a
            correct appraisal. At least all Germans with whom I spoke said the visit and the way the
            offset was handled triggered things and was a factor both in the fall of <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> and the new accent on overtures to the
            French.</p>
                    <p>He seemed to harbor no grudges over the Berlin voting problem.</p>

                    <p>2. I called late yesterday on Chancellor Kiesinger at my request. I was with him for an
            hour. Only his aide, <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">Fonoff</gloss> Rep <persName corresp="#p_OH3">Osterheld</persName>, was present. This was my first opportunity to
            call on the Chancellor, who was inducted on December 1. He had only the previous day
            given his initial reception for foreign ambassadors—thus putting himself in
            business.</p>
                    <p>3. I congratulated the Chancellor on his elevation to his high office. Recalling our
            long association when he was Minister-President of Baden Wuerttemberg I expressed my
            pleasure and that of our government in working with him. We know him well and had full
            confidence in him and in his friendship for the US.</p>
                    <p>4. I thereupon gave him the letter to himself from the President dated December
              19,<note n="3" xml:id="d194fn3">See <ref target="#d192fn2">footnote 2, Document
                192</ref>.</note> together with Christmas card from the President. Kiesinger read
            the letter carefully, expressed appreciation for the warmth of the President's greeting
            and said he would reply shortly.</p>
                    <p>5. I also gave the Chancellor for later reading the US policy statement (see Embtel
            6525 and State 98003)<note n="4" xml:id="d194fn4">See <ref target="#d188fn2">footnote 2,
                Document 188</ref>.</note> approved by the Dept for transmission to <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> Brandt, and a copy of the very favorable NY Times
            editorial of that day which commented on his Policy Statement to the Bundestag. I
            attempted to clarify for the Chancellor the conflicting rumors concerning the
            possibility of a visit of the President to Europe in the spring, by reading to him the
            most recent official US statement (made December 12)<note n="5" xml:id="d194fn5">Not
              found.</note> on this question.</p>
                    <p>6. Kiesinger then commented that German and American interests were to a very wide
            extent the same. He proposed to develop and expand our traditional good relations—to
            bring our nations into a close understanding. He refused to accept an “either-or” in
            Germany's relations with France and the US. Although he hoped to establish good
            relations with France, this need not be at the expense of relations with us. There are
            many issues, <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> organization for example, on which he
            differs sharply from France.</p>
                    <p>7. I assured Kiesinger that we had no doubts as to his impartiality. We were not
            engaged in a running popularity contest with the French. We hoped he would be able to
            develop close and fruitful relations with France, which we considered to be vital for
            the peace of Europe.</p>
                    <p>8. I thereupon raised with the Chancellor the partial draft non-proliferation treaty
            which I had been instructed to take up with the <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> earlier that day (reported separately).</p>
                    <p>I emphasized that in our judgment the draft did not foreclose any important German
            nuclear objectives, including the eventual creation of a European nuclear force, to
            which the Chancellor had made reference in his television appearance on December 18. It
            would enhance Germany's <pb n="480" xml:id="pg_480" facs="0510"/>image—particularly in
            Eastern Europe. If, on the other hand, Germany were the only important “holdout” to a
            non-proliferation treaty, her reputation would suffer enormously.</p>
                    <p>9. Kiesinger replied that although the matter had been discussed briefly in the cabinet
            meeting that morning, there had been no opportunity for detailed study of the draft
            itself. The German policy, as given in his Policy Statement, was quite clear. They were
            against German possession or control of nuclear weapons. He is aware of the strong
            reaction there would be against Germany if they would oppose a treaty. Their only
            concern is one of “keeping the door open”—for options for the future, and to assure
            Germany's nuclear protection after the treaty is signed. He queried me as to our
            impression of timing. When would Germany be faced with a decision? The next cabinet
            meeting was scheduled for January 11. I undertook to inform the Fonoff on this
            point.</p>
                    <p>10. I then raised with Kiesinger the question of Eastern Policy. There was much in his
            Policy Statement which corresponded closely to portions of the President's speech of
            October 7. <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> Brandt had yesterday before the
              <gloss target="#t_WEU1">WEU</gloss> spoken, as had the President, of the possibility
            of phased withdrawal of forces from Central Europe.</p>
                    <p>11. Kiesinger replied that he did not expect spectacular results from his policy,
            however, “something new would happen.” He wished to avoid the old nomenclature—“Must
            détente precede reunification or vice versa.” The supreme German policy was not
            reunification but peace. Although this is nothing new, there was relief on the part of
            the Germans that he had stated it. The new point that he sought to inject was “that we
            should all together try to achieve détente”—at the same time being sure that nothing was
            left undone in the military field. Indeed, has not the ratio of forces turned in recent
            years in favor of the Soviets? We must not lose the military confrontation, however
            détente must be pursued and reunification must be “infused” into it.</p>
                    <p>12. I assured the Chancellor of our sincere desire to see reunification accomplished.
            We would not be content merely to await its coming about automatically through the
            historical welding together of East and West Europe, if it could be accomplished earlier
            in any other peaceful way.</p>
                    <p>13. Kiesinger then commented on the fact that, although there was some anti-American
            feeling in Europe, this was least true of all in Germany—despite efforts by the <gloss target="#t_NPD1">NPD</gloss> to stir it up. The only real problem was a fear on the
            part of some that the US would seek détente at the expense of reunification. Germany
            should not put itself in the position of a girl who constantly seeks reassurance from an
            old lover “that he still loves her”. This is not dignified. Great good could be
            accomplished, however, if the President could come to Germany and explain his policies.
            He would be well received.</p>

                    <p>8224. <gloss target="#t_NATUS1">NATUS</gloss>. Subj: Talk with Chancellor Kiesinger.
            Chancellor Kiesinger asked me to call on him today so that he could report to our govt
            the results of his meeting with General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>
            on Jan 13–14. It is perhaps significant from the standpoint of his attitude toward the
            US that we were the first country he had chosen to report to and that he did so on his
            first day back in office.</p>
                    <p>1. German and French relations with US </p>
                    <p>Kiesinger said that his objective in meeting with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName> was to revive the German-French treaty without, however, creating
            any “twilight” areas of uncertainty. He had a “very clear” discussion with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> with respect to the relations of both countries
            with the US. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> said that he had respect
            for the US, but that the US was so powerful that it could not help “dominating.” To this
            France will not submit, even though it is a “friendly” domination. France wishes to
            retain its ties and alliance with the US but to carry out an independent policy. On the
            other hand, he considered that Germany had been too “obedient” to the US, “even
              <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>.” In response, Kiesinger agreed that
            the US naturally had its own interests and would be “stupid” not to act accordingly. The
            problem is to determine the extent to which US interests can be brought to coincide with
            those of Europe as a whole, and of individual European countries. At the peak of the
            cold war there had been a very close correspondence of interests. Perhaps there is a
            difference now. We should talk about it. Kiesinger said that he had made clear to
              <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>, however, that Germany's position was
            different from that of France. Germany will continue to support <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> on an integrated basis, and Germany wished US troops to remain in
            Europe. To these ends Germany will cooperate with the US. He agreed, however, with
              <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> that Europe must make an increasing
            contribution toward the “molding of its fate.” According to Kiesinger, there was little
            dispute or extended discussions in the foregoing exchange. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> admitted that he recognized Germany's position and attitude to
            be different. (Kiesinger interpolated this to me to mean “for the time being” and that
              <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> fully expects that Germany <pb n="482" xml:id="pg_482" facs="0512"/>will eventually come around to the French
            viewpoint.) According to Kiesinger, both he and <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName> agreed that the cooperation of France and Germany under its treaty
            need not be handicapped by their respective attitudes toward the US.</p>
                    <p>2. Viet Nam</p>
                    <p>Regarding Viet Nam, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> only said that the
            US position was “not good,” that we would find that we “can't conquer a swamp.” To this
            Kiesinger replied that Germany cannot say the same thing, if for no other reason than
            that “we are a divided country.”</p>
                    <p>3. <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> membership in the Common Market</p>
                    <p>With respect to the further development of the Common Market and the question of <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> membership, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName> raised his old objection. Kies-inger in turn proposed that the “door
            should be left open.” He told <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> that
            Germany had a strong desire for the success of the <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> Round in order to bring down the tariff walls separating it and
              <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss>, with which it had important trading interests.
            He told <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> that the question of the entry
            of the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> into the Common Market is one for decision by
            the Six. A decision should be postponed until Wilson has had an opportunity to talk with
            the French Govt in Paris.</p>
                    <p>4. European détente</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> emphasized the importance of a policy
            of détente in Europe. The present confrontation in Europe must be reduced “step by
            step.” This was a thorny problem, however, it will be less difficult now than in the
            future to get the Soviets to a détente—including increased economic and cultural
            exchanges. France needs a period of peace in order to develop its country. Kiesinger
            replied that Germany also seeks détente in Europe. They agree that this is the only way
            to preserve peace. Germany hopes, however, that throughout the process her allies will
            keep German reunification in mind. He realizes that the solution cannot be “figured out
            now,” however, it should not be left entirely to the future. He told <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> that he could not accept his interpretation
            that German reunification must wait until the end when complete détente has occurred and
            it will therefore come automatically. The Germans are not willing “to pursue détente
            just for détente's sake.” He believes that every peaceful opportunity should be seized
            to further reunification.</p>
                    <p>According to Kiesinger, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> agreed with
            his formulation. Kiesinger observed to me that he was not in the end able to envisage
            precisely what <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> had in mind in his
            concepts of détente, entente and cooperation. According to him <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>, however, does believe that the Soviets are so
            preoccupied in dealing with their own problems, including Red China, that they will be
            willing to avoid a confrontation in Europe.</p>

            particular reference to the efforts of that Government to improve its relations with the
            countries of Eastern Europe. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
            said the problem involved was that of the German Democratic Republic. The <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> was a member of the Soviet Bloc and did not want to be
            the “poor boy.” If relations between Eastern Europe and West Germany were to be
            improved, the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> insisted this process should not be
            discriminatory against it. The Soviet Union supports the position of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. During this phase of the discussion, Ambassador
              <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> referred in passing to the question of
            voting rights for Bundestag members from West Berlin, and there was some discussion as
            to whether relations between the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> might not be more susceptible to improvement after the
            disappearance of <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> from the scene.</p>

                    <p>8747. <gloss target="#t_NATUS1">NATUS</gloss>. Subj: Meeting with Brandt. I met today
            with <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> Brandt at my request. I advised him that
            my basic purpose was to discuss with him his forthcoming visit to America starting Feb 8
            in WashDC. I went over the present plans and asked him what subjects he had particularly
            in mind for discussion. I noted that he had already indicated that he wished to talk
            about the offset. Brandt replied that another important subject was East-West relations.
            He had no further specific ideas apart from the proposed non-proliferation treaty. The
            ensuing discussion centered around the following points:</p>
                    <p>(1) Offset. I reported to Brandt the consternation which has been caused in London and
            Washington, as well as their Embassies here in Bonn, by State Sec Schuetz's statement in
            London that there would be no money in the 1967 German budget for offset payments beyond
            the current agreements. This would, of course, create a severe problem, particularly for
            the British. We hoped that the German Govt would take no firm decision with respect to
            the future of the offset until after full consultation within the Trilateral Commission
            and, hopefully, in agreement with the British and ourselves. The British are so
            committed to a troop reduction in the event the offset is not continued, that a
            completely negative position by Germany could result in a large-scale exodus of British
            troops later this year, which would also play into the hands of Senator <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> and others seeking a reduction of US forces.
            With respect to the long-range offset, I felt that a suitable formula could be worked
            out between the Germans and ourselves involving their defense purchases which they would
            obviously have to make, plus suitable financial neutralization for the remainder.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> replied that Schuetz's statement had
            intended to refer only to funds available within the current budget. He hoped that the
            govt could go to the money market for additional sums. He himself was interested in the
            possibility of a financial neutralization of part of the US offset; however, his latest
            information from the Bundesbank indicated some difficulty. In response to my query, he
            said that no decision had been made with respect to the possible Phantom-Spey purchase
            from the US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> which, I pointed out, would go a long
            way toward solving the British problem for some time ahead.</p>
                    <p>
                        <pb n="485" xml:id="pg_485" facs="0515"/> Brandt said that the new German rep to the
            Trilateral Commission, Amb <persName corresp="#p_DGF3">Duckwitz</persName>, would
            shortly be in touch with his opposite numbers. He speculated on the possibility of his
            visiting them separately before convening a new meeting, in order to convey to them the
            seriousness of the difficulties faced by the Germans in their budget. I did not attempt
            to dissuade him from such a course; however, I pointed out that little progress could be
            expected towards the Tripartite objectives of the commission unless all three were
            present.</p>
                    <p>(2) Non-proliferation treaty. I advised the <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>
            that Amb <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> had not intended to convey to Amb
              <persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName>, as we had heard he had reported,
            that the wording of the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> must be accepted by the
            Germans on a take it or leave it basis. We welcome constructive suggestions from the
            Germans and others. However, we had only pointed out that great difficulties might
            arise, not necessarily with ourselves but with the Soviets, in attempting to get
            changes. I also told Brandt that we knew his attitude and that of the Cabinet, which had
            on Jan 11 approved the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> in principle, but that I was
            concerned by the widespread criticism and suspicion of the treaty developing in Germany.
            In particular, I was concerned at the “straw man” being created to the effect that the
            treaty would stand in the way of European political unification. Such doubts would be
            increased by Amb <persName corresp="#p_GWG1">Grewe</persName>'s speech before the German
            Foreign Policy Assn on Jan 25 (see Bonn 8688).<note n="2" xml:id="d197fn2">Dated January
              26. (Ibid., DEF 18–6)</note> I hope that the govt will do what it can to clear up
            these misgivings.</p>
                    <p>Brandt replied that it was difficult to do this. He would not make speeches in defense
            of the treaty because of the secrecy imposed on the subject and the fact that the draft
            itself could not be shown. He hoped however, in the near future, to speak publicly on
            several matters of principle raised by the treaty. He expected to raise not only German
            objectives—but those held in common with others. He mentioned, in particular, Italy.</p>
                    <p>I pointed out that, according to our interpretation, which we had made clear to the
            Germans and would subsequently make public, the treaty would not deny them anything
            which was capable of their attainment or which they had not already foresworn. I was
            confident that the German Govt would ultimately approve; however, our relations would
            suffer if there resulted a widespread feeling that German interest had thereby been
            sacrificed by us as a contribution to our détente policy with the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>(3) <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and the Common Market. I asked Brandt whether he
            had any information regarding the results of <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName>'s recent visit to Paris.<note n="3" xml:id="d197fn3">
                            <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> visited Paris January 24–25.</note> He
            replied that he did not; however, he was expecting a message shortly <pb n="486" xml:id="pg_486" facs="0516"/>from <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName>. He
            explained that Germany's attitude with regard to British entry into the Common Market is
            quite clear. Germany would like to see the Common Market enlarged, so she will have a
            larger trading area and thereby be better able to bear the burden of the charges forced
            on her in agriculture. However, Germany is not in a position to force the issue with the
            French. One cannot, Brandt said, “change the map of Europe.” (I assume he meant by this
            substitute England for France.)</p>
                    <p>(4) East-West policy. I expressed interest at the recent reports of the impending
            establishment of diplomatic relations between Germany and Romania.<note n="4" xml:id="d197fn4">For text of the January 31 communiqué announcing the exchange of
              diplomatic recognition, see Meissner, Die deutsche Ostpolitik, p. 181.</note> I asked
            how the prospects looked in the other capitals. Brandt replied that State Sec <persName corresp="#p_LR7">Lahr</persName>, who has just returned from Budapest, reported the
            Hungarians “may be willing” to follow the Romanian example. They must first, however,
            discuss the matter at a party meeting which is scheduled in the near future. In response
            to my query, he said that the Berlin clause question would not appear to be a problem.
            The Hungarians appeared willing to accept the formula worked out with the Romanians.
            Prague, however, posed greater difficulties. There was no trade mission there which, as
            in Bucharest and Budapest, could be transferred over to the economic section of the new
            Embassy as a going concern.</p>
                    <p>He would, in addition, while he is in Washington, wish to discuss German relations with
            the Soviet Union. Unfortunately, these are negative. I commented on the tough line that
            Soviet Amb <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName> has been taking in private
            conversations (i.e. with the British Amb and myself, as reported in Bonn 8085).<note n="5" xml:id="d197fn5">Dated January 12. (Department of State, Central Files, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 15 <gloss target="#t_GER1">GER</gloss> W)</note> Brandt
            remarked that, following <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName>'s recent
            return from Moscow, he had either very rigid instructions or no instructions.</p>
                    <p>(5) Indian wheat. I went over the general objectives of Under Sec Rostow's recent visit
            to Bonn, pointing out the great importance we attach to the members of the consortium
            assuming responsibility in the future for emergency shipments of grain to India, and
            specifically for 1/2 of the requirements for the last half of this year. The President
            looked on this as comparable to a “community fund” operation in the US, where the
            leading citizens are all expected to help their less fortunate neighbors. The better
            endowed countries of the world could not ignore, on humanitarian grounds alone, the
            impending food crisis in India. We felt that Germany, one of the wealthiest of the free
            world countries, would certainly want to do her share. Having in mind Germany's tight
            budget, we would be glad as Under Sec Rostow advised, for Germany to get credit under
            the current offset for any grain purchases she made from the US.</p>
                    <pb n="487" xml:id="pg_487" facs="0517"/>
                    <p>I pointed out that this would, of course, be limited to payments during the first six
            months of this year. It could not come from deposits made in the past, which had already
            been adopted into our balance of payments. I hoped that the German Govt would make its
            decisions within the two week period estimated by Min Wischnewski. It would be most
            favorably received in Washington, if he would come there with a positive response.</p>
                    <p>Brandt replied merely that he understood the importance of the US proposal and that he
            would discuss it with the Chancellor.</p>

                    <p>8889. <gloss target="#t_NATUS1">NATUS</gloss> info. Subj: Chancellor Kiesinger's
            concern for U.S. understanding.</p>
                    <p>1. During a dinner party given by the Chancellor yesterday evening, he drew the <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss> aside to express the hope that there would be no
            misunderstanding in the United States as to his intentions. He was firmly committed to
              <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and to the necessity for a continuing U.S. troop
            presence in Europe as essential to German security. He also wanted us to know that the
            developing German Eastern policy would be conducted with due regard for U.S. interests,
            and that we should not be alarmed if, in view of current French influence in Eastern
            Europe, the FRG relied primarily on the French to vouch for it.</p>
                    <p>2. Kiesinger went on to say that he did not have the impression from his recent visit
            to Paris that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> hated the United States
            or was taking revenge for imagined or real slights suffered in the past. He was,
            however, genuinely resentful of U.S. cultural and economic influence in France and of
            what he considered the contamination effect of the overwhelming American presence in
            Europe. Kiesinger noted he had emphasized <pb n="488" xml:id="pg_488" facs="0518"/>that
            the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> wants a strong United States in Europe to which
              <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> had responded with a shrug.</p>

            stressed to the <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss> that the Chancellor is very
            sensitive to the possibility that his actions will be misunderstood in the United
            States. He wants us to know that the basic German policy of friendship towards us<note n="2" xml:id="d198fn2">President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>
              reviewed a copy of this telegram, circled the phrase “German policy of friendship

              Library, National Security File, Country File, Germany, vol. 12)</note> and reliance
            upon us for the security of Europe remains unchanged.</p>
                    <p>We have heard from other sources of Kiesinger's concern in this regard. We have no
            reason to doubt his sincerity, though some of the advice he is getting from within his
            party may not be so friendly.</p>

                    <p>The Secretary asked how East-West relations were developing.</p>
                    <p>Brandt replied with a smile that this was an area where the issues could be discussed
            both in Paris and in Washington without differences. <pb n="489" xml:id="pg_489" facs="0519"/>He added, however, that relations with the Soviet Union remain difficult.
            He mentioned a Note received from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> this morning
            returning the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>'s Note informing the Soviet Government
            of the establishment of relations with Romania.<note n="2" xml:id="d199fn2">For text,
              see Documents on Germany, 1944–1985, pp. 946–948.</note> The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> Note was returned because of mention that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> was the legitimate spokesman for the German people. However the Soviet
            Note was not in itself as tendentious as that which the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> had received in January.<note n="3" xml:id="d199fn3">For extracts, see
              ibid., pp. 944–946.</note> Nevertheless, Brandt thought this might be part of the
            Soviet effort to convince the other Eastern European states to take a harder line with
            the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> than Romania had. In this the Soviets may have
            achieved some success. The Czechs were again asking that the Munich Agreement be null
            and void ab initio (a more acceptable formulation appears to have been under
            consideration by the Czechs before). Nevertheless Brandt retained the impression that
            the Hungarians and Czechs still had a strong tendency to develop better relations with
            the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, i.e., to follow the Romanian example. He
            mentioned Manescu had told him in Bonn to do what they liked with the Hungarians and
            that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> might say Romania had only done what the
            Soviet Union had done earlier with Germany, i.e., included West Berlin in trade with the
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. (Brandt said the Romanians would permit the
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> to take care of West Berliners “a titre
            humanitaire”.)</p>
                    <p>Poland was admittedly more difficult. Danish Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_KJO1">Krag</persName> in Warsaw found no particular change, thought
            Gomulka difficult, Cyrankiewicz relaxed and Rapacki colder now than during the Cold War.
            Still the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> had hopes, in part because they thought
            French contacts on their behalf might be successful and because they were hopeful that
            Krupp manager <persName corresp="#p_BB3">Beitz</persName>, who had good connections with
            the Poles from wartime days, might be able to achieve something. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> will keep us informed through Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName> on what transpires. Brandt hoped Poland will
            come around, but said it will take time.</p>
                    <p>Yugoslavia was difficult largely for juridical reasons. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> broke relations with Yugoslavia<note n="4" xml:id="d199fn4">West Germany
              broke diplomatic ties with Yugoslavia in 1957.</note> and the problem of course
            concerns how third-world countries will regard <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
            resumption of relations with a state that still recognizes the Soviet Zone after the
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> broke relations with them for that very reason. In
            this connection, Brandt mentioned German gratitude for our efforts to prevent
            recognition of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> by third countries. He added the
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> was still looking for a legal formulation that
            would make Yugoslavia a case distinct from others, like declaring Yugoslavia part of
            Eastern Europe. He admitted making a special case of Yugoslavia is a headache. Meanwhile
            the first step was to get direct communications in Bonn for the German diplomat in

                    <p>Returning to the Soviet Union, Brandt thought that considerable progress had been made
            on the one hand between him and <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> in
            Berlin and, on the other, between Carstens and Tsarapkin in Bonn. However, since then
            the new Government there seemed to be a wall between <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName> and the Germans. Even trade talks were interrupted with
              <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName> saying that he wanted Soviet trade to
            receive the same treatment as that of Common Market members. The Russians were not
            amused by the rejoinder asking whether the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would
            also be willing to accept the same obligations. Brandt knew that the Russians had tried
            the same trade approach to the French, from which he concluded that this policy was not
            directed exclusively at the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. He wondered whether
              <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName> was really properly instructed
            yet.</p>
                    <p>Before the new Government, he had an impression of forward motion on the question of
            exchange of declarations of the non-use of force. He had heard nothing since. As for the
            Soviet propaganda note, he said Bonn intended to answer it against the advice of the
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> Ambassador in Moscow. As seen from Bonn the note
            was worth answering, if only to score a few propaganda points and place the German
            position clearly on record. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> would then try to
            move forward on trade, scientific and cultural exchanges.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary mentioned that our own bilateral relations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had not really been inhibited by Viet-Nam, mentioning
            the Civil Air Agreement concluded in May, the Consular Agreement now before the Senate
            and the Outer Space Treaty as examples.<note n="5" xml:id="d199fn5">For text of the

            He said wryly that the Soviet negotiators do not appear to have the word reciprocity in
            their vocabulary, that somehow the greatest tragedy which could befall a Soviet
            negotiator was to realize that he could have gotten more.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary concluded it was important for all of us to contribute to the bettering
            of East-West relations.</p>

                    <p>9817. <gloss target="#t_Disto1">DISTO</gloss>. Subject: Meeting with Kiesinger—<gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>1. I called on Chancellor Kiesinger late today at his request. At the outset he told
            me, as I had previously been advised that he had arranged the meeting in order to
            reassure me that the report made earlier in the week by a US news agency to the effect
            that the German Govt was dissatisfied with its relations with the US and with the
            American Amb was entirely false.<note n="2" xml:id="d200fn2">A <gloss target="#t_UPI1">UPI</gloss> dispatch reported that German officials had attributed a worsening
              diplomatic climate in part to <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName>.
              (Telegram 9702 from Bonn, February 20; ibid., PER <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGHEE</persName>)</note> As an old friend, I had certainly known this. However, he
            wanted to set the record straight and had asked his Press Rep Von Hase to make a
            statement earlier in the day to this effect, advising the press of my visit. Some
            anonymous informant had apparently given rise to the story. He assured me, however, that
            there was no such attitude on the part of him or his Cabinet.</p>
                    <p>2. Kiesinger continued that he had, during his recent meeting with Sen <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Robert Kennedy</persName>,<note n="3" xml:id="d200fn3">February
              2.</note> made the observation that he hoped that discussions between us would not be
            limited to points of disagreement—but also deal with broader issues and with areas in
            which there existed a common understanding. He had not intended to say this in a
            critical vein, since he considered it applicable equally to the German side. In response
            I said that we agreed with his observation. I pointed out the many specific areas such
            as defense, foreign aid, information policy, anti-pollution and resource development and
            space, in which organized consultations had proceeded with the previous govt and which
            we were in the process of resuming. I referred to the recent successful visit of FonMin
            Brandt, the invitation to DefMin Schroeder for a visit in April and the invitation we
            are extending to Min Heck.</p>
                    <p>3. The Chancellor replied that this was all excellent but he was also referring to
            those broader policies within which particular issues fit. He used as an example the
              <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> issue, which had struck Germany so emotionally. He
            is in the process of trying to calm Germany down on this issue. He is seeking to prevent
            the impression that Germany is reacting emotionally, causing unusual difficulties or
            conspiring to obtain nuclear weapons. He regretted some of the public statements that
            have been <pb n="492" xml:id="pg_492" facs="0522"/>made, particularly that of former
            Chancellor Adenauer,<note n="4" xml:id="d200fn4">During a February 16 speech at the
              University of Madrid. For text, see Konrad Adenauer, Reden, 1917–1967 (ed., H.
              Schwarz) (Stuttgart, 1975), pp. 484–491.</note> as he had told Adenauer. Others,
            however, have raised sincere and objective questions which he hopes can be answered. No
            one, for example, can accuse Prof Weizsaecker of wanting an atomic bomb, but even he
            finds problems with respect to the treaty.</p>
                    <p>4. I suggested to the Chancellor that, as a way of precipitating more definitive
            discussions, he might wish to have Amb Foster visit Bonn at a suitable time. I had
            discussed this matter with our higher officials in Washington and yesterday with Amb
              <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> in Geneva, and he had indicated
            willingness to come after the current <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> session gets
            underway. Also Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KMB1">Kratzer</persName> of the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>, who had recently been here on a short visit, would be
            willing to return with others and sit down around the table with the German technicians
            to answer their doubts and questions. I referred in this connection to my discussion of
            the previous day with Science Min Stoltenberg, who had raised with me some seven
            technical points which we had undertaken to answer. The Chancellor said that both
            suggestions seemed appropriate and he would let me know when this could be arranged.
            Next week may be impossible since he would be spending most of the time in Berlin.</p>
                    <p>5. The Chancellor observed that an important aspect of the problem was to assure that
            no impression is given the German people that they are being pressured to sign the
              <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>. Such pressure could have bad results for the
            coming Landtag elections. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s statement in

            accurate, to the effect that “if the treaty came about the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> would have to sign” had had a bad effect in Germany. This had caused
            concern as to how the Soviets would function under the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>; would they use it as a basis for interference in German affairs.</p>
                    <p>6. I expressed appreciation to the Chancellor for the statement made by the German Govt
            yesterday to the effect that they were in agreement with the idea of nonproliferation in
            principle. We agreed with the two conditions they had posed, namely, that nuclear powers
            should undertake disarmament measures and that Germany should be protected in scientific
            research and commercial applications. Both had been included in the draft preamble we
            had shown the Soviets in Geneva.<note n="6" xml:id="d200fn6">The February 20 U.S. draft

                    <p>9959. Subj: Improvement of <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>-US relations. For the
            Secretary.</p>
                    <p>1. As is evident from our recent reporting, we are currently in a difficult stage in
            our relations with the FedRep. The fears and accusations of American disinterest and
            abandonment, voiced by men of much influence in Germany, have reached disturbing
            proportions. In large part, they have an emotional rather than a factual basis, however,
            there is small comfort in this circumstance for us. I believe it to be essential at this
            point to try to understand what lies beneath this emotion, and to consider what steps we
            can take to reverse the trend.</p>
                    <p>2. I believe that the German Govt and people are troubled because they do not see
            clearly for Germany the future role they feel that they—as one of the three leading
            economic and military powers of the free world—are entitled. They have during the past
            year witnessed a weakening of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, to them the
            keystone of the established order which provides the basis for their security. They see
            a number of mutual interests emerging between the US and the Soviet Union, which they
            feel could bring about a realignment in the post-war security pattern. In such an
            atmosphere <pb n="494" xml:id="pg_494" facs="0524"/>it is perhaps only natural that
            there has developed an urge for Germany to pursue its own national interest in
            establishing a more favorable position for itself in the world community. German
            authorities are so far unable, however, to define just what this position should be.
            Meanwhile they are suddenly fearful that before they can reach this definition the two
            great powers will decide Germany's destiny between them. They feel “boxed in.” They are
            frustrated by the limited freedom of action that they feel is permitted them in their
            international relations.</p>
                    <p>3. We began our relations with the grand coalition under a number of handicaps. First
            and foremost, there was the fall of the Erhard government which, because of its close
            ties to the US and our alleged association with its demise, constituted a blow to our
            position here. The offset issue, which was so central to Erhard's problems, seemed
            itself to raise the question of how closely the US continued to identify European
            security with its own. Although the new government says little about it, they must
            deeply resent having to pay the current offset in the light of the serious budgetary
            problems they have inherited. In addition, there is the increasing conviction here that
            the US has lost interest in Germany and Europe because of its preoccupation with
            Asia.</p>
                    <p>4. Nonetheless, we have made considerable progress in establishing good relations with
            the new government. Kiesinger and Brandt are well known quantities to us—and sympathetic
            to us. They have made it very clear that despite their bow to the French they wish to
            improve understanding with Washington. Their efforts in this direction, however, have
            until now been largely thwarted by the highly negative German reaction to the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>, a reaction which shows signs of the psychological
            considerations mentioned above. There is in particular a feeling of frustration that we
            have, without adequate consultation, presented Germany with a fait accompli in the
              <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> with which it has no choice but to comply—despite
            possible adverse effects on German and European interests. Despite our best efforts the
            almost universal impression persists in Germany that the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> is a sign of a new pattern of world organization being worked out
            secretly together—and imposed—by the two superpowers.</p>
                    <p>There is widespread fear as to where this will leave Germany. In many cases this fear
            has nothing to do with German access to nuclear weapons. Rather it is a fear that the US
            has lost faith in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and hope for a united Europe,
            leaving Germany to find its own future, possibly in the company of such neutrals as
            India and Sweden.</p>
                    <p>5. As the Chancellor told Senator <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Robert Kennedy</persName>
            and subsequently me (Embtel 9817),<note n="2" xml:id="d201fn2">
                            <ref target="#d200">Document 200</ref>.</note> he hopes that German discussion with
            the US can go beyond specific points of disagreement—to broader and more positive <pb n="495" xml:id="pg_495" facs="0525"/>aspects of common policy as well. I believe he
            has in mind that the US should try to inform the German Govt, and Kiesinger in
            particular, what our plans are for the longer range future—when the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> will have become a reality and the offset solved in one
            way or another. To do this a good bit of preparatory thinking will obviously be required
            on our part—as well as by the Germans.</p>
                    <p>6. It is with this background that I make the following recommendations:</p>
                    <p>A. Kiesinger visit. A principal element of uncertainty in our relations with Chancellor
            Kiesinger is the unclear status of the initial meeting between Kiesinger and the
            President. Kiesinger is a man of high intellectual qualities—who seeks an overall
            conceptual frame within which to place the particular aspects of policy, such as <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>, with which he must deal. It is evident that Kiesinger
            strongly desires, at first hand, an exposure to the President's personal thinking for
            the future. There is ample evidence that the postponement of discussions for a meeting
            with the President is being used as evidence of a negative attitude in our government
            toward the Chancellor and his Cabinet. I would propose, therefore, that I be permitted
            to tell Kiesinger that although the President wishes to come to Germany he has not yet
            been able to make a firm decision and that this should not interfere with a Kiesinger
            visit to the United States. If the Chancellor will tell us when in his view he considers
            such a visit to be propitious, and mutually convenient date can be found, the President
            will be delighted to extend an invitation. I would assure him that he will be warmly
            welcomed.</p>
                    <p>B. <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> consultations. For the immediate future we
            should do everything possible to provide answers to the seemingly unending series of
            questions raised by the Germans—public and private—on the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>. I have, as reported in Embtel 9817, proposed to the Chancellor that Amb
              <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> come to Germany to discuss the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> with him personally. The Chancellor's reaction was
            positive. I have been in contact with <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> who
            will be glad to come once the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> gets
            underway—perhaps after another week. I have also urged that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KMB1">Kratzer</persName> of the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> return
            for a second visit to talk with the German scientific community, as well as with FonOff
            officials, and that he be accompanied by other technical experts. This has been arranged
            starting Feb 27. I am continuing my detailed private discussions on <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> which so far have included Kiesinger, Science Min
            Stoltenberg and <persName corresp="#p_BK6">Kurt Birrenbach</persName>.</p>
                    <p>C. East-West relations. I believe that we should make a concerted effort to bring home
            to the Germans that we offer them full support in the achievement of their own Eastern
            policies, and that we stand ready to coordinate with them our activities in this field
            where this proves desirable. (Although this seems obvious to us there is evidence that
            it is not so to the Germans.) This could also be a central theme of any eventual meeting

            Speeches by leading Department officials should include approving references to
            Germany's new Eastern policy. We should make clear to the Germans that we are always
            prepared, where this is appropriate, to plead their case in Moscow and other East
            European capitals. Finally, as concrete proposal, I recommend that a group of three or
            four ranking Department officials come to Germany to discuss with their counterparts
            here in a systematic way our mutual assessments of the situation in Eastern Europe, our
            mutual policies and the means for better coordinating these policies. Perhaps this group
            could be headed up by Under Sec Rostow or Counselor <persName corresp="#p_BRJ1">Bowie</persName>, and include Lisle, Director for Eastern Europe, and Brzezinski of
            Policy Planning. The agenda might include the following: closer prior consultations
            concerning impeding unilateral move in Eastern Europe; greater German access to the end
            products of the US intelligence community, whose resources are greater than those of the
            FedGovt; a more systematic effort to pass on to the FonOff reports received from Prague
            and Belgrade, where the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> has no regular missions and
            instructions to our missions in other Eastern European capitals to maintain the closest
            liaison with one another.</p>
                    <p>D. Western security. I would suggest that State Secretaries Schuetz (FonOff) and
            Carstens (Defense) be invited to Washington for a few days of off-the-record discussion,
            to include at least in part, the Under Secretaries of State and Defense. Every effort
            would be made to encourage an atmosphere of confidence and informality. Since both
            Carstens and Schuetz speak English, communication would be easy. The talks would center
            on the future of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and how we see Western security
            ensured for the future. We would attempt to give the Germans the feeling that they have
            some insight into our long-range thinking. This kind of conversation would be of
            immediate benefit in increasing confidence between us, and would be an excellent
            preparation for an eventual meeting between the President and the Chancellor.</p>
                    <p>7. I would appreciate your personal attention and comment on the foregoing at the
            earliest opportunity.</p>

                    <p>146957. From the Secretary.</p>
                    <p>1. I have reviewed your thoughtful analysis of the current state of our relations with
            the Germans,<note n="2" xml:id="d202fn2">
                            <ref target="#d201">Document 201</ref>.</note> as well as your recommendations to
            improve them. I agree with your assessment that, to a large degree, the German reactions
            to issues like the proposed non-proliferation treaty have as much of an emotional as a
            factual basis. I suspect much of the current uneasiness among many of the Germans stems
            from their efforts to adjust to changes which are occurring in Europe, particularly as a
            result of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>'s work and the subsequent
            looser cohesion in the alliance. Unquestionably, the reorientation of the Germans in
            their relations to France and to us has contributed to this uneasiness. Although Brandt
            and Kiesinger on one or two occasions have spoken out on behalf of better relations with
            us, I fear that most German politicians, and particularly the German press, have not
            helped very much in keeping our relations on a level keel. It seems to me that we will
            have to let the Germans spend a little time sorting out their own attitude and determine
            for themselves in what directions their best interests lie. At the same time, we would
            want to make sure that their reactions do not result in upsetting the moderate
            government which now runs Germany or let them drift in a direction dangerous to our
            national interests.</p>
                    <p>2. With this in mind, I come now to your recommendations. I believe that a meeting
            between the President and Kiesinger at the proper time would be in order. The problem is
            essentially one of finding an appropriate time. Right now, for instance, such a visit
            would be interpreted as a desire on our part to call him to task for his remarks in Bonn
            before the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_CSU1">CSU</gloss> press
              club.<note n="3" xml:id="d202fn3">Apparent reference to a statement made at the
              February 11 <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_CSU1">CSU</gloss>
              Party meeting in which Kiesinger outlined current Ostpolitik efforts and the basis of
              the policy. For extracts, see Meissner, Die deutsche Ostpolitik, pp. 188–190.</note> I
            understand one German press service has already taken this line. I notice Kiesinger said
            in his remarks that our conversations have all dealt with contentious subjects. While we
            have sought in the past not to have this happen, it is rather difficult to avoid
            discussions of subjects like the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>, troop levels,
            balance of payments problems and so forth.</p>
                    <pb n="498" xml:id="pg_498" facs="0528"/>
                    <p>3. As far as the proposed non-proliferation treaty is concerned, I believe we have been
            forthright in giving answers to the questions posed by the Germans. I have seen to it
            that all questions posed are answered. We discuss the proposed <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> with any German who comes to us. Blumenfeld, the Hamburg Deputy, was here
            just the other day and Adrian Fisher spent considerable time with him allaying his
            concerns. I know you and your staff have similarly been responding to German requests.
            We shall be glad to have <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> or Fisher go to
            Bonn as soon as possible. I agree that it was a good idea to have <persName corresp="#p_KMB1">Kratzer</persName> of the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> return
            to Bonn. If the Germans wish to explore technical aspects raised by the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> further, they would be most welcome to do so in
            Washington where the resources are most readily available.</p>
                    <p>4. On the subject of East-West relations, I find it a little difficult to believe that
            the Germans could question our support of their activities leading to an improvement of
            East-West relations. When Brandt was here, he opened his discussion of this subject, you
            may recall, with the remark that this is one subject that he could take up in Paris or
            in Washington and get the same positive reactions. Our own efforts to improve relations
            with Eastern Europe ought to serve as a fairly good indicator of our views on this.
            However, I am not opposed to impressing upon them that we do approve, and your
            suggestion that leading Department officials include in speeches approving references to
            Germany's new Eastern policy can certainly be carried out. On the whole, our willingness
            to respond to their request that we support them in the Arab World, Finland and India is
            a more demonstrable indication of our support of their position. I see no problem either
            in giving them greater access to the end product of the U.S. intelligence community or
            to pass on to the Foreign Office reports received from capitals where the Germans have
            no diplomatic missions, subject to the usual limitations of not endangering our own
            intelligence gathering efforts. I am not convinced that group discussions on East-West
            relations of the sort you recommend in your paragraph C would, however, serve a really
            useful purpose at this time.</p>
                    <p>5. As for the visit by Schuetz of the Foreign Office and Carstens of Defense to
            Washington for off-the-record discussions of Western security, I believe such and
            similar discussions might well precede a meeting between the President and Kiesinger
            when such a meeting can be arranged. <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> will
            of course be over here with Schroeder for the discussions with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> in April. But the suggestion you make would
            provide an opportunity for our as well as the German side to prepare their respective
            positions in some detail and perhaps reach preliminary agreement, thereby assuring that
            a meeting between the President and Kiesinger might have more substantial results.</p>

                    <p>10199. Subject: Kiesinger visit. For the Secretary and Under Secretary.</p>
                    <p>1. In accordance with the instructions given me late yesterday over the telephone by
            the Under Secretary, I sounded out Chancellor Kiesinger last evening on the question of
            a possible visit to the States.<note n="2" xml:id="d203fn2">
                            <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> discussed the meeting in At the
              Creation of a New Germany, p. 215.</note> Knowing the sensitivity of the subject, I
            was, as I have always been in the past, extremely cautious. As instructed, I did not
            purport to speak either for the President or the government, but assumed personal
            responsibility for my remarks. Our discussion took place alone after a small informal
            dinner in honor of retiring Con Gen Paul Sweet, an old friend of the Kiesin-gers, which
            was the first private social function the Kiesingers have attended since he assumed
            office. Since I have known Kiesinger well for almost four years our conversation was on
            a very easy and confidential basis.</p>
                    <p>2. I began by advising the Chancellor that I wanted to discuss frankly with him the
            question of his possible visit to the States, in light of the speculation on this
            question which had emerged on the preceding day in the German press. Naturally, as the
            head of a country which is such a close friend and ally he would always be welcome in
            the States. We have not as yet raised the question of a visit with him officially
            because we have not wished to appear to be “rushing” him so soon after his coming into
            office. We have wanted to give him ample opportunity to carry out his planned visit to
            France, to establish his regime and to evolve his own policies—without apparent pressure
            from us. We had, moreover, observed certain statements attributed to him to the effect
            that he wished to delay his visit to America until after he had achieved his main
            legislative objectives. When he reaches the conclusion that he is ready for a visit, and
            there is something important that he wishes to discuss with the President, I would
            appreciate it if he would advise me. I was confident that, once a time suitable for both
            him and the President could be found, there would be no difficulty in arranging the
            visit.</p>
                    <p>3. Kiesinger responded by saying that he had never intended to give the impression that
            he wished to delay his visit to America for any reason connected with his attitude
            toward the US. He recounted his long background of good relationships with Americans in
            Bonn and Stuttgart <pb n="500" xml:id="pg_500" facs="0530"/>and his frequent visits to
            the US to see his daughter who is married to an American citizen. When he came to power
            he had felt a strong necessity for overcoming the results of the “neglect” in German
            French policy, which he considered had resulted from Schroeder's curiously negative
            attitude toward the French. He had to this end visited Gen de Gaulle and they had had a
            very frank discussion. He had pointed out to de Gaulle the limitations on French and
            German cooperation, and had advised de Gaulle that Germany would continue to cooperate
            with the US. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> had responded to this in a
            rather cynical way, i.e. that the Germans would ultimately come to the French view with
            respect to the US; however, he would not seek to influence them in this respect.
            Kiesinger said that he really didn't know whether anything important would come of
            Germany's relations with France; however, he considered it important for all that he
            make an effort to continue friendly relations. I assured him that we fully agreed.</p>
                    <p>4. Kiesinger then said that, assuming we thought it desirable, he wanted to go to the
            US. When should he go? I replied that I believed this to be a decision for him. When did
            he feel that he would be ready, in terms of the evolution of the policies and actions of
            his regime? He replied that he thought it best to go before his next meeting with de
            Gaulle, which is now scheduled for June. He has, up to now, been consolidating his
            leadership over the coalition government. I gathered that he felt this had just about,
            but perhaps not quite yet, been accomplished.</p>
                    <p>There were certain high priority pieces of legislation that he wished to see well
            launched toward passage. When I asked him if he referred to the emergency legislation,
            the stabilization law and a new electoral law, he nodded. He hoped that all this could
            be accomplished by May. In short, he thought May was the right time.</p>
                    <p>5. Kiesinger said that the principal purpose of a meeting with the President and other
            US leaders should, in his view, be to provide the opportunity for a broad discussion on
            long-range problems and policies of the West vis-à-vis the Communist bloc. He referred,
            as an example, to the discussions held in the Bilderberg Group, which he on one occasion
            attended. He did not wish to negotiate specific issues, such as the offset or the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>. Indeed he hoped that by then the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> would be signed on conditions which would be considered to be honorable
            for Germany. (I thought it interesting that he apparently revealed his expectation that
            the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> would be signed.)</p>
                    <p>6. I advised the Chancellor that I would inform my government fully on our
            conversation, portraying it as not being an initiative on his part but as a result of a
            frank discussion which I had myself raised.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Comment:</p>
                    <p>I believe that Kiesinger has now gone as far as we can expect him to go in suggesting
            that he visit the US. In view of the uncertainties which <pb n="501" xml:id="pg_501" facs="0531"/>have been discussed privately and in the press as to whether he would be
            welcome, I do not believe that we should expect him to be the first to make the
            suggestion publicly. To do so would, from his viewpoint, possibly result in an
            embarrassing rebuff or delay. We would, in almost any normal similar circumstances,
            welcome a visit from a new German Chancellor—in connection with his calls on other heads
            of allied states. Our only hesitancy in the past has, as I understand it, arisen out of
            the unusual circumstances surrounding our relationship to the previous Erhard govt and
            Kiesinger's relationship to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>. Since
            Kiesinger has, I believe, in his conversation with me, removed any barriers arising out
            of these associations from his standpoint, I believe that we should do the same and
            should proceed to extend a normal invitation for him to visit the President, and attempt
            to work out a suitable date in May. It is obvious, in any event, that the visit must
            ultimately take place. As soon as a decision has been made to explore the time, I would
            hope that an announcement could be made both in Bonn and Washington to this effect. This
            would, I believe, have the effect of “pricking the bubble” of speculation which has
            grown to sizeable proportions here, and would enable us to resume a more normal
            relationship as preparations for the visit get underway.<note n="3" xml:id="d203fn3">In

                    <p>1. I attended a two-hour luncheon March 17 at the Embassy residence of Soviet
            Ambassador to the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName>. He was accompanied <pb n="502" xml:id="pg_502" facs="0532"/>by Embassy Counselor Komarov, Protocol Officer
            Khrustalev, and a translator named Michurina. Minister Morris and Polansky of <gloss target="#t_USBER1">USBER</gloss> accompanied me. The atmosphere was relaxed and
            straightforward. <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> was quite forthcoming
            and in good humor.</p>
                    <p>2. Our conversation touched on relations between the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> on the one hand, and East Germany, Eastern Europe and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> on the other, Berlin matters, and US-Soviet relations.
            The Berlin and US-Soviet topics are subjects of separate telegrams.<note n="2" xml:id="d204fn2">

                    </p>
                    <p>3. <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> relations with Eastern Europe and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. After an initial exchange of pleasantries, I noted
            that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> appear to have reacted negatively to the new Eastern European policy of
            the Kiesinger government. I said that the establishment of diplomatic relations between
            Bonn and Eastern European countries could hardly be construed as a threat to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> or East Germany and invited <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName>'s comments.</p>
                    <p>4. In a lengthy response, <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> made the
            following points: the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> was not opposed to the
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> establishing diplomatic relations with socialist
            countries. However, Bonn would have to give up its claim to represent all of Germany,
            and efforts to acquire nuclear weapons. Bonn makes pleasant noises about improving
            relations with Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, but does not follow this up with
            practical deeds. In fact, Bonn's policies are similar to those of <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>. As Governing Mayor Brandt, in his conversations with <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName>, made many intelligent comments about improving
            relations with <gloss target="#t_EE1">EE</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, but said he (Brandt) was not in power in Bonn and therefore could not
            do anything. Now Brandt is in power and still is not doing anything constructive. The US
            welcomes Bonn's new Eastern European policy; we should, however, advise Bonn to take
            new, realistic steps in its Eastern European policy which would be acceptable to the
              <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and East Germany.</p>
                    <p>5. With respect to Berlin, the US and the Soviet Union say that they are for the status
            quo. However, the US apparently makes no efforts to prevent the Kiesinger government
            from taking provocative actions, such as high-level talks and Bundestag meetings in
            Berlin. These are provocations against the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, when
            they occur in Berlin.</p>
                    <p>6. In reply, I pointed out that the US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
            appraise Bonn's policies differently. One can hardly call the Bonn government revanchist
            just because it wants to reunite the German people. Bonn has done nothing aggressive in
            this regard, and has gone so far as to renounce unilaterally the acquisition of nuclear
            weapons. It makes no claims for any <pb n="503" xml:id="pg_503" facs="0533"/>specific
            areas beyond the Oder-Neisse Line, and asserts only that the final determination of
            German borders must await the signing of a peace treaty. I pointed out that I knew the
            present leaders of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> government very well
            personally and that <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> knew Brandt. One
            could hardly call these leaders aggressive.</p>
                    <p>7. I said it seemed to me that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the East
            Germans had adopted a harder attitude toward the Kiesinger government than they had
            toward <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>. The Bundestag Committee meetings in Berlin were normal and could
            hardly be called provocative. Furthermore, the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
            appears to have adopted a much harder line on such issues as passes for holiday visits
            and hardship cases. I saw no reason for the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to
            fear the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, which is a relatively small country.
            Moreover, the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> has only a small army, much smaller
            than Soviet forces in the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, which remains under
              <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> control.</p>
                    <p>8. In response, <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> stressed several times
            that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is not afraid of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. If the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> starts
            something, however, there will be not much left of it.</p>
                    <p>9. Troop withdrawals from Europe. In response to a question about rumored Soviet troop
            withdrawals from the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> said that there was no truth to it. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> favors a continuation of the status quo in this connection. <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> said that, as regards reciprocal withdrawals,
            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would wait for deeds, not words. After the US,
            the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and France withdrew from Germany (it was not clear
            whether he meant all or part), then the Soviet Union would withdraw from East Germany.
            He added in a jocular vein that since the US had the farthest to go, it should start
            first. I said nothing committal on this question.</p>
                    <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> said he had read that the cost of
            maintaining US troops in Europe amounted to approximately two billion dollars. He
            observed that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> pays for US forces stationed in
            West Germany, whereas the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> pays for Soviet troops
            in Eastern Europe. I replied that there was widespread misunderstanding on the issue of
            troop costs. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> does not pay for US troops. We ask
            only that Bonn balance its foreign accounts with us either through the purchase of
            weapons or of bonds. We do not insist they purchase weapons they do not need.</p>
                    <p>11. German reunification. <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> said that we
            should be realists and not expect German reunification during our lifetime. Moscow will
            not give up the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and Washington will not give up the
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. Two separate German states exist, with different
            social-economic systems. I noted we had no illusions about when reunification would
            occur. However, we were certain that Germany would ultimately be reunited, and that
            until this comes about the division of Germany would continue to represent a serious
            source of tension in Central Europe.</p>

                    <p>Mr. President:</p>
                    <p>I had a good talk with our old friend Ray Cline today, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text
                            not declassified</hi>]. He makes the following points.</p>
                    <p>1. Kiesinger himself never believed there was much to be gotten from Paris but felt the
            try was necessary to convince others of the limits of that relationship. There now is
            more widespread understanding that Paris cannot—or will not—advance serious German
            interests.</p>
                    <p>2. With respect to openings to the East, the Germans are finding, as might have been
            predicted, that the going will be long and slow. They will not despair of this policy;
            but they are increasingly conscious that the problem of German unity will not be solved
            soon; and that there are great resistances as well as historic opportunities in playing
            Eastern European nationalism and assertiveness.</p>
                    <p>3. Therefore, they have pretty well come to the judgment that they must rebuild their
            tie to the United States as the foundation for their policy over the near and middle
            future.</p>
                    <p>4. Kiesinger himself—and almost certainly others such as Schroe-der—knew this from the
            beginning but they had to reckon with the pressures from Strauss, with respect to Paris,
            and Wehner, with respect to the East.</p>
                    <p>5. The coalition, while tolerably close to a consensus on the above, remains extremely
            uneasy politically. As we know, Kiesinger is presiding over a cabinet which contains at
            least three major contenders for the Chancellorship in 1969. He has a great vested
            interest in making this coalition a success. The others have a primary interest in their
            own emergence by 1969 and judge the success of the coalition on whether its success will
            advance or detract from their candidacy.</p>
                    <p>6. Ray's point is that we should deal with Kiesinger as a man facing an extremely
            delicate political problem and not as a normal political leader with an assured domestic
            base of power. It is his assessment that Kiesinger's general orientation with respect to
            U.S. interests is good; but he is under pressures from elements in his coalition to make
            noises which are at best independent-sounding, and, at times, almost anti-American. The
            case for compassion is not sentimental, so far as U.S. interests are <pb n="505" xml:id="pg_505" facs="0535"/>concerned; it is that the most probable successor to a
            failure of the coalition, in Ray's view, is Strauss—not Schroeder or Brandt. In
            particular, Strauss appears to be picking up support by taking a nationalist line on the
            non-proliferation treaty; and he hopes to build from his position as Finance Minister
            the paternity of a new phase of German revival and prosperity.</p>
                    <p>7. Specifically, Ray recommends that you do see Kiesinger some time before he is
            scheduled to see <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>—in June. (The
            Franco-German agreement requires that they meet at 6-month intervals.)<note n="2" xml:id="d205fn2">

                    <p>8. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] it is clear that Kiesin-ger found

              244</ref>.</note> (Following is approved record of conversation.)</p>
                    <p>1. Brandt said that he felt urgent need to bring trilateral talks to a good result.
            Redeployment of troops should come not on the basis of balance <pb n="506" xml:id="pg_506" facs="0536"/>of payments, but on a basis of technological change.
            Then, obviously quite concerned re this point, Brandt said “democracy in the Federal
            Republic of Germany does not depend on the presence of foreign troops.” He was quite
            certain that rightist groups in Germany had no future, and that Germany's partners
            should recognize this.</p>
                    <p>2. Vice President assured the Vice Chancellor that the U.S. did not regard the <gloss target="#t_NPD1">NPD</gloss> vote as significant. It did not indicate any more
            influence in Germany than did Birch Society strength in the Rocky Mountain states
            indicate power in U.S. American troops in Germany are not forces of occupation, Vice
            President said, they are there to add reality to our commitment to European security.
            Any reduction of our troop levels would not mean any lessening of that commitment.</p>
                    <p>3. Brandt said that this was a very delicate issue, particularly because of leaks on
            German side following discussions with U.S. He regretted these leaks. He had discussed
            matter with his colleagues in hope that something could be done about problem. If he had
            chosen not to speak with his colleagues, it would have [been] difficult to make anything
            happen.</p>
                    <p>4. Vice President acknowledged the American concern with the news leaks. This was
            always a problem. There was a need for frank discussion in private about this matter. He
            believed that after trilateral discussions were concluded and modifications in troop
            levels might be made, there might be possible press misunderstanding. But what counted
            was the commitment to each other of nations and leaders.</p>

                    <p>To assess the cohesiveness of the grand coalition government in West Germany and to

                    <p rend="center">Conclusions</p>
                    <p>A. The coalition headed by Chancellor Kiesinger has gained broad public support in West
            Germany and will probably remain united at least until the federal election of September
            1969 draws near.</p>
                    <p>B. The extreme rightist National Democratic Party (<gloss target="#t_NPD1">NPD</gloss>)
            is likely to make further gains in the next year, but we believe that it will remain a
            fairly small minority of the German electorate during the period of this estimate.</p>
                    <p>C. While maintaining its defense ties with the US and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, the Kiesinger government will be more assertive of national interests
            than previous governments in Bonn. Recently emerging political differences have led to a
            gradual increase in German criticism of various US policies and the present dispute over
            the proposed non-proliferation treaty will intensify this development. Nevertheless, we
            believe that if the principal other nonnuclear nations sign, the Kiesinger government
            will feel compelled to go along.</p>
                    <p>D. Kiesinger will continue his efforts to improve Franco-German relations, but the
            practical results will probably be limited, and the West German Government is not likely
            to accept French hegemony in Western Europe.</p>
                    <p>E. Bonn's present emphasis on improving relations with Eastern Europe, already
            successful in Rumania, will probably have some success in Hungary, Bulgaria,
            and—somewhat later—in Czechoslovakia. We think it unlikely that the West German
            initiatives will bring about any major change in Soviet policy toward Germany.</p>
                    <p>F. Bonn will seek to expand contacts with East Germany, even high-level contacts which
            might eventually approximate de facto recognition, but will almost certainly not grant
            de jure recognition to the Pankow regime.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName> and Kiesinger met twice on April 5.
              During the morning session, they discussed U.S.-German relations. In the afternoon,
              they talked about the Non-Proliferation Treaty, East-West relations, and a

              on these discussions are ibid. <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName>
              summarized his impressions of these talks in telegram Vipto 85 from Berlin, April 6.

                    </p>
                    <p>1. Both Chancellor and Vice President expressed their satisfaction with today's
            discussions. Latter stated that he thought they had closed a chapter of
            misunderstandings between the two countries which had existed over the past year or so.
            They had come out of a “dim atmosphere” back into “the clear air.” He considered today's
            talks a political success for both sides.</p>
                    <p>2. Following the discussion, Chancellor took the Vice President privately aside and, in
            great earnestness, told him he would do nothing to impair US–<gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> relations. Nothing was more important to him than friendship and close
            cooperation with the US. He would not heed others in Europe who would divide the US and
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. The Chancellor said discussions during the day
            had been “like sunlight bursting through the clouds.” President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> must know of his loyalty and steadfastness—he
            could be counted on as our friend and partner. As a result of today's talks he felt
            happy and confident. He was particularly reassured re <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>. He would help however we asked re liquidity and other problems,
            including the Kennedy Round. He desperately wanted the friendship of President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and America.</p>
                    <p>3. Vice President thanked him for his obviously sincere expression and told him he
            would so inform President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>. He (the VP)
            wanted Chancellor to know that we stood by our friends, kept our commitments, and that
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> could count on us.</p>

                    <p>1. Reftel, which requests me to make an oral presentation to Chancellor Kiesinger on
            the possible adverse effect of the <gloss target="#t_ECE1">ECE</gloss> Finance
            Ministers' meeting, scheduled for April 17–18, on the ultimate solution of the
            international liquidity problem, has been forwarded to me in Berlin where I am making a
            scheduled visit. I have been in touch with Embassy Bonn, who advise that Kiesinger is
            not available under normal circumstances today and tomorrow, since he is campaigning in
            Schleswig-Holstein.</p>
                    <p>2. Under the circumstances, it would appear to me to be putting undue pressure to seek
            an extraordinary meeting with the Chancellor, say out of Bonn, wherever he might be in
            his campaign, in light of the fact that this same subject has been raised with him in

                    <p>Bonn/Bad Godesberg</p>
                    <p>April 14, 1967</p>
                    <p>His Excellency Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">H.C. Kurt Georg Kiesinger</persName>
                    </p>
                    <p>Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany</p>
                    <p>Bonn</p>
                    <p>Dear Mr. Chancellor:</p>
                    <p>I have been asked to bring to your attention the concern of the United States
            Government over current developments in the negotiations on plans to reform the
            international monetary system. In particular this concern relates to the possible
            outcome of the April 17–18 meeting of the Finance Ministers of the European Economic
            Community.</p>
                    <p>Our fear is that the Ministers will at that meeting adopt a common position in
            international liquidity negotiations favoring a general drawing rights proposal, based
            on inadequately defined and limited common ground, which would fall far short of what is
            needed. Such a result would risk failure of the four-year effort to reform the
            international monetary system, with grave consequence for the future evolution of
            economic relationships between Europe and America.</p>
                    <p>You will recall, of course, the interest of the President in a successful outcome of
            these negotiations by September of this year, which he expressed in his letter to you of
            March 11. The Vice President also told you of our hope that your government would extend
            its active cooperation in bringing about agreement on an effective plan for reform of
            the monetary system.</p>
                    <p>Secretary of the Treasury <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName> has written two
            letters to Economics Minister <persName corresp="#p_SK6">Schiller</persName> about
            these matters. I attach copies of these letters for your ready reference. In his letters
            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName> explains in some detail our
            objectives in the negotiations, and our concern at the trend of recent developments. In
            particular the possible outcome of the forthcoming meeting of the Finance Ministers of
            the European Economic Community.</p>
                    <p>I have been instructed to tell you that the viewpoints expressed in Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName>'s letters reflect the political policy of the
            United States Government at the highest level. I hope therefore that you will review
            personally the issues and positions presented in Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName>'s letters, <pb n="511" xml:id="pg_511" facs="0541"/>so that they
            may be given appropriate consideration in your discussions with your Cabinet colleagues
            prior to the meeting.</p>
                    <p>Sincerely yours,</p>

            Director, Joint Staff at 1900 hours on 20 April 1967. Gen Boie delivered the substance
            of a message received from the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> Government pertaining
            to the proposed redeployment of US forces from Germany.</p>
                    <p>2. The proposal of the German Government relating to US forces redeployments is

                    </p>
                    <p>3. Gen Boie stated that if possible the German Government would like to obtain
            agreement on their proposals prior to the Trilateral Talks; if not, they would be
            discussed in the Trilateral Talks. If still necessary, they intend to make such
            proposals to the <gloss target="#t_DPC1">DPC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>4. Gen Boie also indicated that the German Government would like to discuss at the
            Trilateral Talks whether and in what way the US and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> redeployments from the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> might be used
            as an initiative to obtain mutual withdrawal from the “other Germany” of Soviet troops.
            In this connection, they ask that “experts” meet in London on 27 April to discuss the
            mutual reduction problem. (The German Government has requested that the Principals'
            meeting be held in London on 28–29 April.)<note n="3" xml:id="d210fn3">For a summary of

                    </p>
                    <p>5. Gen Boie stated that the German Government requested that a joint report by the
            three governments not be prepared this time but rather that each Principal prepare a
            separate report to his government to be passed to the <gloss target="#t_DPC1">DPC</gloss>. It is further requested that any troop redeployment proposals be made by
            the individual governments to the <gloss target="#t_DPC1">DPC</gloss>. Finally, Gen Boie
            stated that the German Government requested that the results of the Trilateral Talks not
            be presented to the <gloss target="#t_WEU1">WEU</gloss> before being presented to the
              <gloss target="#t_DPC1">DPC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>6. Gen Boie stated that these same <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> proposals would
            be presented to the Department of State on the morning of 21 April 1967.</p>
                    <p>7. He further requested that I come to Bonn early next week to meet with the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> Joint Staff. Tuesday, 25 April 1967 would be appropriate,
            since Gen Buchs and staff would be available then and since this would give the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> needed time before the Trilateral Talks on the 28th of
            April 1967.</p>

                    <p>I understand <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt</persName> spoke to you about my staying
            behind on Sunday-Wednesday. On reflection, I suspect I can be of more help to you <pb n="513" xml:id="pg_513" facs="0543"/>here than in Europe. I hate to miss the trip, but
            with the Kennedy Round, liquidity negotiations, trilaterals, and non-proliferation all
            coming to a head, I had better keep holding the ring.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">One comment about your meeting with Kiesinger </hi>. I may be soft on
            the British, but I am not on the Germans. However, in deciding how to talk to Kiesinger,
            I think it is important to remember that you are three times his size—and that he knows
            it. He also knows that <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> was close to you.
            For both reasons, as well as the Nazi business,<note n="3" xml:id="d211fn3">Chancellor
              Kiesinger had been a member of a Nazi youth organization.</note> he is deeply insecure
            about his relations with you. A congenial and collegial approach could do wonders in
            reassuring him, and turning him into a more reliable friend. And I don't believe that
            this would mislead him into thinking that he has any hold or claim on us.</p>
                    <p>I am aware of your doubts. But I would bet that with a little Presidential warmth you
            can bring this man into line, in spite of the pressure on him from <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> et al to prove that he is not an American stooge.
            The gain to us from making him feel that he is a friend—and therefore has to act like
            one—can be very great. The Germans will have a lot to do with the outcome in
            non-proliferation, the Kennedy Round, international liquidity, etc. And together, the
            above will cast a very long shadow.</p>
                    <p>It is true that deGaulle has nothing to offer the Germans, and that they will soon find
            that out. But by then they may have committed some great mistakes. If they stick with
            the French on international money, or don't help us move the Kennedy Round forward, or
            balk on non-proliferation, the structure of our relations with Europe could turn very
            sour. I am afraid it will be of no comfort to us that the Germans too would soon find
            out how wrong they had been. They are not immune to some whoppers, even when they have
            the most to lose.</p>
                    <p>Forgive me this special pleading. But we are reaching a crucial moment on a lot of
            fronts and the Germans are in a key position. I agree: it would be dead wrong for the
            President to plead with this man or to twist his arm. But to sit down and do a little
            friendly reasoning together—spelling out for him what kind of pressures you face at
            home, anxieties you have about the future of U.S.-European relations in case Kennedy
            Round and non-proliferation and liquidity go down the drain—could make a great deal of
            difference.</p>
                    <p>Now I'll hold my peace. Have a very good and successful trip. My thoughts will be with
            you.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Kiesinger stated that it was a great honor for his government and for the German people
            that the President of the United States, together with so many of his most distinguished
            assistants, had come to attend the State funeral of former Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Though this was a very sad occasion that had brought the President to Germany, he was
            nevertheless happy that the President could be here and meet with him for the first
            time. He hoped they would find an opportunity to exchange views on their common
            problems.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> expressed his appreciation for
            the Chancellor's kind reception this morning. He was aware that the Chancellor had an
            extremely busy schedule for the next two or three days. He did not want to add to his
            burdens more than was necessary.</p>
                    <p>He equally regretted to have to come on such a sad mission, and equally welcomed the
            opportunity to be able to meet with Mr. Kiesinger to talk about his problems (<persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s) and learn about those of the Chancellor.</p>
                    <p>Upon learning of <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>'s death he had
            immediately determined to make the trip and had so stated. The purpose of his coming
            here was to underscore the great respect that he and the entire American people felt for
            the contribution to the world made by the late Chancellor. They also felt the same
            respect and admiration for the German people as a whole, and would continue to uphold
            the relationship of friendship and alliance with the Federal Republic.</p>
                    <p>He appreciated the courtesy that Mr. Kiesinger had shown the Vice President during
            their recent meeting in Bonn. The Vice President had <pb n="515" xml:id="pg_515" facs="0545"/>conveyed a clear picture of the substance of their talks to the American
            people. He had been extremely pleased with the warm reception he had been given in
            Germany. The President was gratified that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName> had had an opportunity to review mutual problems with Vice
            Chancellor Brandt, a very good and old friend.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Efforts to divide U.S. and <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
                        </hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>There were many people in the world who would like to divide Germany and the United
            States, and many attempts had been made particularly during the terms of office of
            Chancellors <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>. None of those attempts, however, had been
            successful. He was positive that the same excellent relationship we had enjoyed during
            this period would continue in the future. He hoped that no enemy would ever be able to
            divide us or cause us to doubt each other.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Future meeting with Chancellor</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The President hoped that he and the Chancellor would be able to discuss certain
            subjects of mutual interest when they meet on Wednesday. He only wanted at this time to
            express the sincere grief and deep sorrow of the American people over the passing of
              <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Konrad Adenauer</persName>. Apart from meeting with the
            Chancellor on Wednesday, he was looking forward to a meeting with the Chancellor in the
            future, maybe in a few months time. He hoped that such an encounter would be
            possible.</p>
                    <p>He had just told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName> over dinner before
            his departure to Bonn, when Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName> was
            telling him about his visit to Germany, that during the three years that he had been
            President he had spent two of the three Christmases with German Chancellors. He had,
            during this period, met with them about a dozen times or so.</p>
                    <p>US–<gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> Consultation</p>
                    <p>He had read several editorials a few days ago which stressed that there were no
            consultations between the U.S. and German Governments. While these editorials were being
            published, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> was in Bonn to talk
            to the Chancellor, Vice Chancellor Brandt was leaving the White House, Defense Minister
            Schroeder was entering his Cabinet room, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> was in Europe for consultations and the Vice President arrived a day
            or so later. Notwithstanding all this activity, the press maintained no exchanges of
            views were taking place.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">
                            <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> high on U.S. priority list</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>He welcomed the opportunity of the forthcoming meeting with the Chancellor, and would
            always look forward to further future discussions of joint problems and interests. His
            (the President's) election had not come out as well as Mr. Kiesinger's and he had to
            deal with a very <pb n="516" xml:id="pg_516" facs="0546"/>recalcitrant Congress.<note n="2" xml:id="d212fn2">In November 1966 Congressional elections, the Democratic Party
              lost 47 House and 3 Senate seats.</note> He was facing complex problems in other parts
            of the world. Some of these had already existed before he took office about three years
            ago. The United States had to live and deal with these problems, but it would never
            disregard the interests of the Chancellor and the German nation. He (Mr. Kiesinger) and
            the German people were right at the top of the list of American attention. The United
            States was willing to discuss all mutual problems with Germany and try to find solutions
            to them. Even if the Chancellor was not willing to sacrifice his Christmas celebration,
            a meeting with him would be welcome at any time.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Praise for <persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName> and

                    </p>
                    <p>The President emphasized his high regard for Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName>, who had visited his home many times. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName> could be sure that he could call on the
            President with any message at any time and be welcomed with open arms.</p>
                    <p>The President also expressed appreciation for the very many courtesies and great
            cooperation shown by the Chancellor and the German Government to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> was doing an excellent job in representing the United States in
            Bonn. He was not only from the President's home state of Texas but also a long-time
            neighbor and good friend.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Vital that US–<gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> stand together</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Despite the fact that so much time and sacrifice had to be given for the support of the
            U.S. fighting men in Viet-Nam, and despite the difficulties with Congress that was
            trying to tie him down much more than he would like, there was hardly any question that
            he was giving more time and attention to—to the relationship of the United States with
            Germany and the other European nations. In the future, as in the past, there would be
            those who would by rumor, gossip and doubt try to divide them. He had no doubt, however,
            that the peace of the world could be assured in the future, as long as the German and
            American leaders would fully trust each other and stand shoulder to shoulder. That was
            what he and his government intended to do.</p>
                    <p>The President then explained that he was descended from German stock and lived in a
            German community in Texas. If he did not have the deep respect and love for the German
            people that he possessed, he would have moved long ago.</p>
                    <p>He was aware that there were many difficult problems and many danger signals in the
            20th century. There would be times of uncertainty on certain subjects. If, however, the
            Chancellor and he would, with equal <pb n="517" xml:id="pg_517" facs="0547"/>friendship
            and determination, continue to stand side by side, the period of their cooperation would
            turn out to be a very good one.</p>
                    <p>In closing the President said that President Eisenhower had very much wanted to be
            present at the funeral, but he was 76, ill and had a heart condition. His doctor had
            vetoed the trip.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">
                            <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> wants US friendship</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Mr. Kiesinger, in response, said that the President had spoken of the burden of the
            Chancellor's office. He was almost embarrassed to compare it with the gigantic burden of
            concerns and responsibility that the President had to bear. He assured the President
            that his government was not only thinking of their own worries and problems, but were
            very much concerned about those faced by the United States. He had so stated in his
            initial Statement of Policy to the Bundestag. His government wanted the same firm
            relationship of determination and friendship that the President had spoken of, and would
            try to consolidate that friendship and make the alliance even stronger.</p>
                    <p>If the President had heard certain complaints made on the German side, and even by the
            Chancellor himself, these complaints were not meant to be unilateral accusations against
            the United States. Rather they were expressing what the Germans themselves had so often
            failed to do.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Quality of consultation</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>As far as consultations between the two governments were concerned, he was not worried
            so much about the lack of frequency, which indeed did not exist. His concern was one of
            quality rather than of quantity. Some subjects should be explored in greater depth.
            Candor should always prevail in their discussions, even on complex and troublesome
            questions.</p>
                    <p>Today, maybe more than at any time since the peak of the cold war, there was in Germany
            a feeling of deep sympathy for the United States, maybe more so than in any other
            European country. He appreciated the President's willingness to discuss mutual problems
            in depth and with candor.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Need to adjust to changes</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>It was true, of course, that great changes had taken place. Nowadays, the world was
            changing as much in a decade as it had once changed during a century. It was necessary
            to follow and adjust to these changes.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic"> Kiesinger would like to visit President</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>He assured the President that he would be available whenever he would deem it advisable
            to have talks with him, be it Christmas, Easter <pb n="518" xml:id="pg_518" facs="0548"/>or Whitsuntide (This would be an especially appropriate time, since the Holy Spirit
            descended during this period). He was as much concerned as the President that they work
            closely together in the future, to help secure peace and freedom and justice. And he did
            not just want to utter those big words.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Hope for even firmer friendship</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>He was aware of the fact that the United States was extremely powerful. It was indeed
            the first nation of the world. The President, as leader of this nation, was carrying a
            tremendous responsibility. He hoped that it would not be considered arrogant on his part
            (or whatever one might want to call it) if he stated that the Federal Republic would
            endeavor to make the friendship between the two countries even firmer and their alliance
            stronger.</p>
                    <p>However, in the joint discussion both sides should endeavor to reach the degree of
            “quality” which was commensurate with this particular hour of history.</p>
                    <p>By the way, he did not think the President would hear many more complaints coming from
            Germany. He had conducted many discussions in the previous weeks, first of all with
            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName>—and he appreciated greatly the
            great job the Ambassador had done in making clear to him the problems and position of
            the United States Government—then with Special Representative <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">John McCloy</persName> whom the President had sent twice to Germany
            in recent weeks. He had, indeed, made a wise choice to dispatch such an old and highly
            esteemed friend of the German people. He was equally grateful for the visit of Vice
            President <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName>, who had proved to be an
            eloquent and convincing representative for the American people, and for the call by
            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName>, whom he had known since his
            early days as a member of the Bundestag Defense Committee. He was also glad to see again
            Secretary of State Dean <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> for whose ability he
            had great respect, and whom he had visited on several occasions.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Need for candor</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>He was convinced that on most of the very important political issues, the interests of
            the two countries coincided to a large extent. Since the height of the cold war, great
            changes had taken place. Still many interests were similar; however, one should review
            their nature as well as those areas where possible friction could arise. The best method
            to secure a firmer alliance was through complete and candid exchange of views in an
            atmosphere of trust. He could assure the President that this was the will of the German
            Government.</p>
                    <p>The President had spoken of growing up in a German community in the United States and
            of hailing from German stock. Many of the Chancellor's family had emigrated to the
            United States, at one time or another, <pb n="519" xml:id="pg_519" facs="0549"/>for
            reasons of material want or political persecution. Once, during the term of office of
            Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>, the latter had asked him to
            be the German Ambassador in Washington. He had asked Jean Monnet his opinion on the
            matter. <persName corresp="#p_MJ8">Monnet</persName> had advised him to go, but had
            warned him at the same time that if he had any children to be prepared to have one or
            all of them take up residence in the United States. He had not become Ambassador, yet
            this had not prevented his daughter from taking up residence in the United States.
            Having a daughter, son-in-law and grandchild there in itself tied him closer to the
            United States.</p>
                    <p>He appreciated very much the Vice President's kindness to have visited with his
            daughter before departing the United States. He also was grateful that the President has
            seen fit to bring his daughter and son-in-law along on this trip. By this he had made
            him and his wife extremely happy.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> said that it had been a great
            pleasure to have Mr. Kiesinger's daughter and son-in-law on the plane. He had enjoyed
            their company very much.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Topics for Wednesday's discussion</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>As for their discussion on Wednesday, if he had to try and outline the main subjects on
            which the two might have fruitful exchange of views, he would name the nonproliferation
            treaty, the question of troop levels, the Kennedy Round and the international liquidity
            negotiations.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">High quality of U.S. personalities</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>If it was “quality” that the Chancellor was interested in, he could not expect to find
            better quality people than those handling the nonproliferation treaty and disarmament
            negotiations for the United States. Among them was the Vice President who had handled
            these matters already as a senator, and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName>. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName> himself
            had kept in close touch with the Munich Conference on currency matters. He had told the
            President that he was quite dissatisfied with the state of affairs at that meeting.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Troop levels</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The troop level question had been discussed in Congress extensively in the past months,
            and he had been subjected to considerable pressure from that side. A hearing on foreign
            troop levels was coming up in Congress next week. He had invited leading congressmen to
            the White House for talks in anticipation of this hearing.</p>
                    <p>Speaking of “quality”, he had discussed the question of troop levels two or three times
            with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> before coming here. He
            had reviewed with him the commitments that both countries had made to each other. He had
            asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, at that time, if he himself
            and top experts could make themselves available for Mr. Kiesinger if he so <pb n="520" xml:id="pg_520" facs="0550"/>desired. The Secretary had agreed. Also, Defense Minister
            Schroeder had been in Washington just a week ago and had had extensive talks with Mr.
              <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>. He had also called on the
            President.</p>
                    <p>One of the two biggest problems existing between the two countries—and this had been
            present ever since the end of the war—was this problem of troop levels in Europe. In the
            past, any expected changes or doubts in this regard had always been reviewed and
            straightened out in a sort of “family talk” between the two governments. Now, however,
            these matters were spread all over the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> and other papers. The American
            people had started to think and talk about them and some had gotten very upset. He
            thought it wise that the two governments keep such questions “in the family”. As was
            once said in Hollywood, in a different context, “include the newspapers out.” This would
            be in the interest of the German Government as well. Added to this publicity was some
            heavy resistance in congressional circles.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, or his experts, would be
            available to discuss details on this matter and to give the United States reasoning on
            any of these questions. He wanted to assure the Chancellor that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> would speak on his behalf. He had been given
            complete authority by him to make any agreement he considered necessary. He trusted the
            Secretary completely.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> had spent some 80 hours
            before Congression-al Committees on questions of troop levels. The Chancellor was
            certainly aware of gentlemen like Senator <persName corresp="#p_FJW2">Fulbright</persName> and Senator <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName>,
            whose thinking was not exactly the same as that of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>. They believed, just as the Chancellor had expressed to him
            before, that great changes had taken place and that these changes were very material
            ones.</p>
                    <p>The President stated that he had urged Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> to stay in frequent touch with the German military and the
            Defense Minister. He believed that cooperation on that level was closer than ever
            before.</p>
                    <p>Speaking of men of “quality”, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> had
            just returned from a Washington meeting of the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>
            countries. The United States had serious problems in <gloss target="#t_SE1">SE</gloss>
            Asia. The Secretary would return to Europe for the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
            meeting in June.</p>
                    <p>So then “quality” seemed well represented in his Government with such people as
            Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName>. And these men
            could be put at the disposal of the Chancellor for consultations at almost any time.
            Should, in addition, the Chancellor need the direct advice of the President, he would be
            glad to find a way to accommodate him. To summarize, the main issues between us included
            the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>, the troop level issue and the liquidity
            question. There seemed to be some new matter to deal with every year. There was now in
            Germany a new Government, a new Chancellor and there was in Washington a new assertion
            of power by Congress, in particular in the Senate. For instance, the foreign policy <pb n="521" xml:id="pg_521" facs="0551"/>committee of the Democratic Party, before which
            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> had been pleading the President's case, favors substantial troop
            reductions in Europe. People like Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName>
            do not think about a reduction of maybe a few thousand, but about many scores of
            thousands—indeed, entire divisions. Out of his own party members, 13 voted against him
            and none for him on the troop issue. In view of such developments, he had to stop, look
            and listen carefully on these matters.</p>
                    <p>He was happy to see the Vice Chancellor again for whom he had warm feelings of
            friendship. He (as Vice President) had been the first to go to Berlin when the Wall was
              built.<note n="3" xml:id="d212fn3">

            Discussions on troop levels should better be conducted in such a manner as not to supply
            ammunition to Congressional critics.</p>
                    <p>He assured the Chancellor that there was no “complicity”, that he was in favor of
            extensive discussions. The President of the United States had not changed. He was still
            the same. He had always had good and friendly feelings towards the German nation and the
            German people.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Keep vital discussions within “the family”</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Mr. Kiesinger stated that he understood the problems the President had with his
            Congress. He often had similar problems with the Bundestag despite his great majority.
            There would be a discussion of the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> coming up in the
            German Parliament in about a week, on which the Bundestag had insisted on its own
            initiative.</p>
                    <p>He agreed with the President's suggestion that discussions on troop levels should be
            kept in the family circle as much as possible, though it could not always be kept out of
            the press. He would try to steer a course that would not involve him in American
            domestic frictions and polemics.</p>
                    <p>He was convinced that the President had men of outstanding quality around him, and he
            always preferred to talk to the political leaders rather than to experts. There was much
            agreement on major trends in their thinking (President's and Kiesinger's). He was
            hopeful that the talk on Wednesday would produce some common results. Regarding the
            problems with Congress on the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>, the Chancellor would
            be very careful to avoid giving the press an opportunity to again sow any seeds of
            friction between the two countries.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>The new coalition government commanded a greater majority which gave it a better
            opportunity to come to solutions on some problems. <pb n="522" xml:id="pg_522" facs="0552"/>However, he also often encountered dissension within his own party.
            Sometimes he had to walk a very narrow path to make his policies prevail. Also, he did
            not have the strong power with which the United States Constitution endows the
            President. In general, however, his Parliament was showing a great amount of good
            will.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> stated that despite the 30 years he
            had dealt closely with Congress as Senator, Vice President and President, he sometimes
            did not have much control over its decision.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">International liquidity</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>One item which he intended to discuss in detail in the Wednesday meeting was the
            “new-money problem”. The talks on this matter had not produced good results. He was
            seriously concerned about this matter.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Press briefing</hi>

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> suggested one should think about
            what to say to the press before adjourning. He suggested that they say that the
            President had called on the Chancellor to pay his respects with regard to the passing of
            former Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>. The President and the
            Chancellor had also taken note of the issues that they wanted to discuss in their
            meeting on Wednesday.</p>
                    <p>It might be acceptable to the President and the Chancellor to say no more than
            this.</p>
                    <p>The President and the Chancellor agreed, and the meeting adjourned having lasted about
            one hour and twenty minutes.</p>

                    <p>Mr. President:</p>
                    <p>The memorandum that follows may be important for your talk with Chancellor Kiesinger on
            Wednesday.</p>
                    <pb n="523" xml:id="pg_523" facs="0553"/>
                    <p>Here is the story.</p>
                    <p>At his request I called on Rainer Barzel at 11:00 a.m. this morning. As you know, he is
            the Majority Floor Leader in the German Parliament. We are good friends. Therefore, I
            gave him your position as outlined yesterday with the bark off, explaining that you
            cannot deal with the <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> problem unless
            they stop behaving like children and start behaving like serious partners in the task of
            preserving the unity of the West.</p>
                    <p>We then went on to the four specific issues. In his judgment, the withdrawal of
            aircraft is the most difficult for politicians in Germany to accept.</p>
                    <p>As we were leaving he said he was going to report immediately to the Chancellor.</p>
                    <p>I received a message this afternoon that he wished to see me again. I saw him at 6:00
            p.m. at the American Embassy. He asked that I report the conversation only to you and
            that the interpreter destroy his notes.</p>
                    <p>This is what he said:</p>
                    <p>I. Chancellor Kiesinger was greatly impressed with you and your personality this
              morning.<note n="2" xml:id="d213fn2">See <ref target="#d212">Document
              212</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>II. He wishes on Wednesday to talk to you “extensively and, if possible, alone.”</p>
                    <p>III. He wishes to discuss the large outlines of your policy rather than the details.
            This is particularly important after your conversation this morning and after Barzel's
            report to the Chancellor of what I said to him. (He meant, it turned out, that the
            Chancellor is pretty clear about what you wish him to do about the four specific
            issues.)</p>
                    <p>I then began to probe what he meant by the “large outlines of policy” rather than
            specifics. I said President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> was a man of
            large ideas and ideals; but he would rather discuss the next step in achieving them
            rather than to discuss them in abstract, rhetorical terms. (At that point he smiled and
            said President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> is like <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>: His last words to his children were not: “Keep
            the family together”; but “make sure you meet every Christmas.”)</p>
                    <p>He then began to explain as follows: There are some people telling the Chancellor that
            if Germany signs the non-proliferation treaty, Germany is giving in on one of the three
            things the Soviet Union demands: the other two are the Oder-Neisse line and formal
            recognition of the East German Government.</p>
                    <p>They then go on to say that troop levels will be reduced by us but not by the Soviet
            Union. After that they ask: Will we have any possibility of raising the question of
            German unity in the future?</p>
                    <pb n="524" xml:id="pg_524" facs="0554"/>
                    <p>The critical question for Kiesinger in the face of this pressure is to be able to tell
            his cabinet that President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> has a concept
            of policy in which there is a place for German unity.</p>
                    <p>For example, Barzel said, President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>
            might say: “I am doing everything I can to ease tensions between East and West because
            the world needs peace. German unity cannot be my first consideration; but out in the
            process of bringing peace and arms control, German unity will have a place.
            Non-proliferation will contribute to the process of arms control. That is the kind of
            world in which German unity has the greatest chance of coming about.”</p>
                    <p>Barzel went on to say that there is no chance for German unity if the world is divided
            into two big blocs. “We cannot achieve German unity by nuclear war; but if relations
            between the U.S. and the Soviet Union improve as we achieve progress in a limited way on
            East/West issues, then we create an environment in which German unity becomes more
            possible in the future.”</p>
                    <p>He then shifted to a specific, practical point. Chancellor Kiesinger in the Parliament
            made a Declaration of the Federal Government on Amelioration of Living Conditions in All
            of Germany.<note n="3" xml:id="d213fn3">For text of the April 12 declaration, see <hi rend="italic">Documents on Germany</hi>, 1944–1985, pp. 955–957.</note> He urged
            that Germans in East and West Germany be permitted to travel more: that
            doctors—specialists—be permitted to cross from East to West. Kiesinger has spoken
            movingly in human terms about Germans being allowed to get closer in these matters.
            Still, the Soviet Union denounced Kiesinger's speech and has flatly refused to move in
            this direction.</p>
                    <p>Barzel then said: “Would it not be possible for President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> to tell Kiesinger that he will instruct Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> in Moscow to make representations to the Soviet
            Government that they should respond to this simple human appeal?” He said that nothing
            would affect Kiesinger and German opinion more than to know that President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>—with his great humanitarian heart—has considered
            seriously, among the human problems on this earth, the problem of human relations among
            Germans and German families divided one from the other.</p>
                    <p>I explained to Barzel that, while you worked for every reasonable approach to the
            Soviet Union, you were skeptical of Soviet motives and how fast they would move.</p>
                    <p>And I came back to my central point in the morning, which was: If we had any chance of
            making progress in the East, it was on the basis of a strong and united West; and it was
            not useful for the German Government to have these hopes to the East while it was
            cutting the ground from under your feet in maintaining the unity of the West. Barzel
            said that he <pb n="525" xml:id="pg_525" facs="0555"/>understood this fully; and he
            believed Chancellor Kiesinger understood it also.</p>
                    <p>Before I make my recommendations, I wish to tell you now strongly I was impressed in
            this conversation that the Germans understand in their hearts—if not in their
            pocketbooks or their press relations—that they depend absolutely on you.</p>
                    <p>You should also know that: The German cabinet has been meeting in the wake of your talk
            with Kiesinger; <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> has asked that I see him,
            which I shall do tomorrow morning; I have received an invitation to talk with Guttenberg
            this evening—the other extreme nationalist in opposition to Kiesinger.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">My assessment and recommendations:</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>I. Your interview this morning with Kiesinger has had one hell of an effect.</p>
                    <p>II. You should agree to talk at length with Kiesinger alone on Wednesday.</p>
                    <p>III. Your talking points should be these:</p>
                    <p>—Although we have 500,000 men fighting in Southeast Asia, I have not pulled out one
            fighting man from <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> through this difficult
            period;</p>
                    <p>—I have kept my commitment in Europe because we have a vital security interest in
            Europe, but also because I am fully aware of the hope for peace in Europe;</p>
                    <p>—Working together in unity we have demonstrated in these 20 years since the end of the
            World War that we can defend ourselves against the Communists, that we can make more
            economic and social progress than the Communists;</p>
                    <p>—And that we can produce in the West societies that are so attractive and successful
            that Communism is failing as an ideology in the East;</p>
                    <p>—The Chancellor should remember that it was only after the Cuba missile crisis that
            people began to talk of détente and that very small steps—the atmospheric test ban—were
            possible; you have been working for small agreements with the West because you believe
            that as Communism becomes weaker, nationalism in the East becomes stronger in each
            country and more normal relations can fully be developed; so far as the
            non-proliferation treaty is concerned, you believe: it makes sense for the human race;
            it makes sense for the free world; and if we stay together it could contribute to arms
            control—for example, the avoidance of a major race in <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>'s;</p>
                    <p>—This is the environment in which you believe that movement towards German unity may
            gradually become possible; of all the American Presidents in this century, you have the
            closest ties to the German <pb n="526" xml:id="pg_526" facs="0556"/>people; you
            understand the pain felt by every German that the division of their country cuts across
            families and language and cultures and memory;</p>
                    <p>—It is a simple fact that of all the nations in the West, the United States is the only
            one that honestly wishes to see German unity brought about: neither the British nor the
            French honestly wish this to happen no matter what they say;</p>
                    <p>—The reason the American people want German unity is because they want an end to the
            Cold War and that requires the drawing together of Germany and all of Europe under
            conditions of security for everyone. If, however, the West cannot remain united and if
            we cannot settle sensibly issues of trade and money and troops, then we shall not have
            détente and movement towards German unity, we shall have danger and crisis again.
            Therefore, the Chancellor should work with the President to maintain the unity of the
            West and count on the President—and on the United States—to be the strongest supporter
            he has in taking steps towards German unity.</p>
                    <p>—You might then say that we are prepared to take small steps or large, whatever is
            realistic and possible. For example, you have been informed of the Chancellor's interest
            in improving the simple human contacts between the people in East and in West Germany.
            Your men have spoken often to Soviet representatives and told them how unwise it is for
            them to attack democratic Germany. You have asked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> to arrange that we talk to the Russians about the wisdom of
            encouraging these human contacts between East and West.</p>
                    <p>—I suggest that you should close by saying once again that it is our experience
            together—Germans and Americans—that we have gotten nothing from the Russians through
            weakness and disunity. It is only if German policy and European policy is rooted in
            unity and strength in the West, that we have any chance of bringing peace to Europe and
            unity to the German people.</p>

                    <p>Chancellor Kiesinger stated that he had been thinking about their earlier
              conversation<note n="2" xml:id="d214fn2">See <ref target="#d212">Document
              212</ref>.</note> and would like to repeat the following:</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">General US–<gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> relations</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>1. His government was strongly interested in maintaining good relations with the US,
            its government, and the President.</p>
                    <p>2. The President had been a little annoyed about some of the comments coming out of
            Germany recently that had contributed to a certain strain of relations. He wanted to
            assure the President that his government would do everything possible not to create any
            difficulties for the US. He did not intend to make any statements on the matters
            discussed between them that would tend to involve him in any efforts by any party
            directed against the President or the US government. The German Government was aware of
            the big burden and heavy responsibility the President has to carry and did not want to
            add to it.</p>
                    <p>In general, he first would like to say how happy he was to be able to be with the
            President though the occasion may be a sad one. The very fact of the two of them meeting
            for the first time was more important than any of the individual decisions they would
            have to make in the coming weeks and months. He would like to emphasize that he himself,
            his government, and the majority of the two ruling parties wanted good relations with
            the US and trusted the President and the US. As a matter of fact, they did not only want
            to continue those good relations but indeed to try to make them better and closer.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Need to avoid certain public statements</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Two days ago the President had talked to him about his concern for keeping certain
            subjects more “in the family circle”. He agreed with that. In the last year the Germans
            had some worries. It had been necessary for <pb n="528" xml:id="pg_528" facs="0558"/>him
            to make certain public statements at certain times but anything that he or Vice
            Chancellor Brandt had said had always appeared in the American news media magnified and
            exaggerated. In the light of this experience he would tend to be more cautious in the
            future.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">German public opinion</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>As regards German public opinion—and he was always following reports on this matter
            closely—there seemed to be general conviction that permanent reconciliation between
            France and Germany would have to be established. On the other hand he would like to
            emphasize that the same people just as much advocate good relations and close
            cooperation with the United States. These two sentiments were not in opposition to each
            other. He believed that at this time public opinion in the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> was more favorable to the US than in any other European country. He would
            also like to say a word about the occasional doubts that had arisen in the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. These doubts were not so much about the President's
            actions but had arisen from general developments. For some years there had been the
            question whether some change of US policy vis-à-vis Europe had taken place.</p>
                    <p>Anything that could be done to allay these doubts would be advantageous. He did not
            want to discuss this matter in great detail. However, he wanted to assure the President
            that it did not amount to a crisis of confidence. Such doubts could be understood from
            the fact that the cold war had abated to a certain extent and that people had not yet
            become adjusted to the new period properly.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> interjected that he was
            familiar with those doubts and agreed that some of them were due to the change in
            climate of the cold war.</p>
                    <p>He believed that current German public opinion presented a big problem.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic"> US public opinion problems</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>So far, the United States had not reduced its troop level in Europe and had not given
            up its support and efforts in other areas despite the serious balance of payments
            situation. The question was, could he continue such a policy in the face of so many
            doubts? During the last six months the US press each day had been full of statements
            about German doubts, lack of faith in US policy and questioning of our commitments. He
            could not quite understand what was really causing those doubts. The US was maintaining
            over half a million troops in Europe and spending over a billion dollars there annually.
            This very morning Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
            and Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> were testifying
            under oath before Congressional committee.<note n="3" xml:id="d214fn3">For text, see <hi rend="italic">U.S. Troops in Europe: Hearings Before the Combined Subcommittees of
                the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and Armed Services. United States Senate,
                90th Congress, 1st Session</hi> (Washington, 1967), pp. 5–56.</note> The first
            question that <pb n="529" xml:id="pg_529" facs="0559"/>would surely be put to them would
            be “Why do we not pull out of Europe in the face of the changes that have taken place?”
            The closer ties between Chancellor Kiesinger and <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName>, the European statements about détente and other reasons would
            certainly be brought up by Congressional critics. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> would have a hard time to make them believe anything.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Force deployment</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Chancellor Kiesinger stated he understood that if the US were to withdraw some forces
            at this time it was planned to cut the number of aircraft in half. The people would ask
            why does the United States not try simultaneously to make the Soviets agree to similar
            cuts? The US had introduced the “rotational plan” which he considered to be reasonable.
            The people would ask why would it not be possible for the US to try to get some
            commitment from the Soviet Union out of the negotiations on the Non-Proliferation Treaty
            which would tend to lessen the danger of war. They felt if there were changes to be made
            there should be some reciprocity on the other side.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> comments on US–<gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> relations</p>
                    <p>He had been told by <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> in Paris on
            January 13–14 that he, even <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>, were too
            obedient to the United States. He had answered <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName> that he was not obedient to the US. Certain changes had taken place
            since the height of the cold war. During that period US and German interests had been
            completely identical. He realized that US policy in Europe had to follow the US
            interests. This was legitimate. He also believed that Bonn and Paris should not proceed
            on anything without the knowledge of Washington. Both sides should review where their
            interests are identical as well as where the areas of friction are. They had neglected
            to do this until now.</p>

            Germany agreed on certain matters. However, he had stated the disagreements, for
            instance on <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, with equal clarity. He had made this
            very clear to the public and had emphasized that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
            fully supported an integrated <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. There was no danger
            that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> would drift away from the US. This he had
            also stated clearly in a speech in the Bundestag. However, he could not prevent certain
            people occasionally making use of his public statements on certain matters to their
            advantage and trying to exploit them.</p>

                    <p>He would like to say a few frank words also with regard to his predecessor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Ludwig Erhard</persName>: He had a very high regard for <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s excellent accomplishments as Minister of
            Economics. However, the German people thought that his foreign policy was a little
            “naive”, that he failed to analyze the situation in depth and failed to recognize at
            times where the true interests lay. The people believed that he failed when he visited
            the President last year. This failure was one of the major reasons that the German
            public had lost confidence in him. His party prior to that had had a constant majority
            in public polls. This had dropped to 38% during the final days of the Erhard
            administration. The Social Democratic Party at that time had received over 50% of the
            votes taken by the public opinion polls. Now, happily, the Christian Democrats were
            above 50% again. He was happy about this fact as otherwise the coalition might break up
            if the Social Democrats should receive a majority. This tendency had been reaffirmed in
            the elections last week in Schleswig-Holstein where the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> had not received the landslide they had hoped for.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">German doubts about U.S.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The <hi rend="italic">doubts about a changed US policy</hi>, he believed, started as
            early as the last period of the Eisenhower administration. He wanted to make clear,
            however, that there was no real distrust about the present relationship between the US
            and the Soviet Union. However, there were some people who were saying that the US had
            sold out to the Soviet Union and was no longer supporting the cause of German
            reunification. Some of this might just be the result of so many years of frustration on
            matters like German reunification.</p>
                    <p>The President asked why the Chancellor thought that such doubts were already present
            during the Eisenhower administration.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor replied he thought this started with the Camp David meeting with
              <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>. The people believed that Eisenhower
            had been too trusting and on top of this came the constant warnings of former Chancellor
              <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>. Some of these doubts were allayed by
            President <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> through the excellent speeches
            be made during his visit to Germany. However, later the same doubts arose again.</p>
                    <p>After a period of personal distrust it seemed to him that during the <hi rend="italic">last meeting with the dying <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>
                        </hi> the latter seemed to have reached a point of trusting that he (Chancellor
            Kiesinger) would follow the general direction of policy set by <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>. The Chancellor stated he strongly believed in
            the necessity for close ties between Germany and France, but without the “romantic
            attitude” on this question that <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> had
            displayed.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>He, Kiesinger, was convinced that it was impossible to guarantee German security and
            find solutions to the German problems without the United States. Solutions to these
            problems could not be found by any drastic actions but only by a gradual approach and by
            creating an appropriate climate. Most of the German people had no illusions about this
            matter and realized it would take a long time. If the US and Germany would stand united,
            show trust in each other and support each other's interests as far as possible, those
            doubts should be appeased. The people realized that a certain relationship between the
            Soviet Union and the United States was necessary in view of the power and the heavy
            responsibility of these two countries. Otherwise, the result might be disastrous. Some
            people were talking a different language but they should let them talk, because it did
            not matter as long as the leaders would consult each other closely and make their own
            decisions.</p>

                    <p>The President said the Chancellor should make no mistake about the US determination to
            support German reunification and the Alliance. He was aware that the Soviet Union kept
            making attacks on the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. However, he invited the
            Chancellor to appoint his best research man on these matters to make a comparative chart
            of Soviet accusations made against Germany and those made against the US President. He
            was convinced he would come out number one on such a comparative chart.</p>

                    <p>The Chancellor said it was shameful in what a blatant way the Soviet Union could permit
            itself to attack the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> in foreign capitals. The only
            European ally that had spoken up in defense of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
            had been President Saragat of Italy. If the Soviets were to attack one of his allies
            like this he certainly would speak up in defense with determination.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Many people did not realize the complexity of the situation, the domestic antagonism
            against the President and the immensity of the problems he was facing in Southeast Asia
            and other parts of the world. He wanted to repeat again that despite existing doubts
            there was no present crisis of confidence, no serious situation. There had been a
            feeling that <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> had not taken a firm enough
            stand on the offset problem during his last visit in Washington. He, Kiesinger, was
            happy that a solution had <pb n="532" xml:id="pg_532" facs="0562"/>been found for this
            problem now. He had been forced to take a firm stand, not least because of the threat
            emanating from the propaganda campaign of the <gloss target="#t_NPD1">NPD</gloss>. The
              <gloss target="#t_NPD1">NPD</gloss> was not only composed of national socialists but
            contained a great number of what the French would call “poujadists”, i.e. mostly
            disgruntled small businessmen, and a few old hard-core nationalists. The <gloss target="#t_NPD1">NPD</gloss> knew that its campaign could only succeed if the party
            was able to create anti-American feelings in the German population. Fortunately, they
            had received less votes during the last two state elections than they had expected. The
            elections in Schleswig-Holstein were a hopeful beacon, as the <gloss target="#t_NPD1">NPD</gloss> had only been able to poll 5.6% of the vote in this state which is
            traditionally very nationalistic. Gallop polls indicate that their national strength
            does not exceed 3%. Their propaganda plus statements by <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> on the Morgenthau plan and his declaration that the US had turned
            its back on Europe and did not really see the magnitude of the Communist threat had
            contributed to the doubts they were talking about. He wanted to reemphasize, however,
            that these were not major doubts and could be coped with.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">On the Non-Proliferation Treaty</hi>, the Chancellor saluted the
            President's intervention through which some important points had been cleared up. The
            individual points of the present text he considered acceptable but the question was if
            the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> could accept the Treaty out of the consideration
            of its relationship with the Soviet Union. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> had
            alone committed itself to forego nuclear weapons in the <gloss target="#t_WEU1">WEU</gloss> agreements and had reiterated this policy repeatedly in public. The
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> wanted better relations with the Soviet Union but
            was running into such statements as Kosygin's declaration in London that it would have
            to sign the Non-Proliferation Treaty whether it liked to or not. There was a strong
            group in his own party disliking the Treaty and the Bavarian branch of the party had
            voted against it altogether. There was also some opposition in the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss>. The question was what could be done to meet the desire
            of the US to have the Treaty and get the necessary approval in the Bundestag. Many
            people including himself and Prime Minister Moro felt strongly that the Treaty should be
            of a limited duration. Five years had been suggested, but he himself felt that such a
            period would be too short and he would consider ten years more acceptable.</p>
                    <p>During the ten years one could see what could be accomplished on disarmament and how
            German-Soviet relations would develop. Then one would be in a better position to talk
            about a possible permanent Treaty. The idea of a limited Treaty was spreading fast. It
            might be useful for both of them to resume discussing the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> after the US congressional hearings and the forthcoming Bundestag debate
            have been concluded.</p>

                    <p>He was not an expert on the <hi rend="italic">liquidity question</hi>. It had not been
            possible to get French cooperation on this matter. He would have to explore it further
            to try and find out where the difficulties were located.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">On the reduction of troops</hi> he was prepared to do all that he
            possibly could. He favored first exploring the matter further in joint discussions. It
            would have to be reviewed in the light of the needs of European security and in the
            light of future developments (e.g. the changes expected in China during the next ten
            years). The thinking of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> on these matters was not
            guided by egotistical motives. The common [good?] was very much on their mind.</p>

                    <p>The President might want to think about the possibility of including their principal
            assistants for the remainder of the talk and what to tell the press. He would suggest
            telling the press that they had friendly and comprehensive discussions, and that they
            wanted to continue the close and friendly relations that had existed between the
            countries in the past.</p>
                    <p>The President replied he had no objections to saying that to the press.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>He said he was trying to put himself in the Chancellor's position and wondering how he
            could convey to him a picture comparing the problems that the Chancellor had with those
            that the President had without becoming argumentative or disagreeable. He believed that
            the picture on German sentiment and German public opinion painted by the Chancellor was
            about correct. He was of the opinion that in the next few months public feeling here and
            public feeling in the US would somehow jell and move jointly into one direction or into
            the other. He was disturbed and doubtful about the state of German public opinion at
            this time and still was not sure what was really causing it: the change of government in
            Germany; the sentiments of former Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>; <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>'s reproaches on
            being too obedient; or whatever else it may be.</p>
                    <p>(<persName corresp="#p_HKG1">Von Hase</persName> entered room)</p>
                    <p>While this was going on in Germany there was a similar type of “unfaithful
            husband-wife” thinking towards Germany in the United States. <pb n="534" xml:id="pg_534" facs="0564"/>People were saying to themselves: Why should we continue to spend over a
            million dollars? Why should we keep on maintaining our troops there? Why should we not
            let them handle their own defense? They are grown up now. They have rebuilt their
            countries. They can take care of themselves. They have a better balance of payments
            situation. Why should we stay if <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> feels
            we should get out, if the Germans doubt us? Why should we not talk to them in terms of
            the 20th century, in terms of planes and rockets rather than in 19th century terms of
            ground troops? If they are looking for defense protection by the French, why not let
            them do just that?</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>The President repeated that he had congressional hearings starting this very day in
            which many of these sentiments would be echoed. He also repeated that 13 of his own
            party leaders had voted down his own suggestions on these matters in a committee. He was
            opposing their views 100% but he did not know if he would always be able to prevail. The
            question was what action to take in view of the sentiments in the two countries. He did
            not want to be the architect of the dismantling of the Alliance. However, in the last
            months much had happened to further such a dismantling.</p>

                    <p>The European press was feeding our press. And he was reading in his press ideas like:

            press was saying: it had become fashionable in Germany to be independent, to criticize
            the US; some governments believed the US to have become a second-rate power; the US was
            “buddying up” to the Russians. Some people were doing all they could to try and divide

                    <p>He wanted to be friends with Germany. First of all, he had no illusions about the
            Soviet Union, not any more than the late <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>,
            President Eisenhower, or President <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName>. He
            also had no illusions about the importance, necessity and desirability of enduring
            friendship and loyalty to the German people. He would never want to give up this
            partnership. He had been the first to say this when the Berlin Wall went up. He was
            speaking up for the reunification of Germany. He had made clear that if the need should
            arise he would do whatever was necessary with the troops stationed here. He had made
            clear his desire to ask for concessions from the other side whenever possible. If he
            were to reduce his forces to any significant extent he fully intended to ask the other
            side to <pb n="535" xml:id="pg_535" facs="0565"/>make similar reductions in their

                    <p>The Chancellor should not be misled by the statements of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>. The Chancellor should make his own judgment
            about the President. He could be sure that this President would work with him. Likewise,
            he was looking towards Kiesinger, the Chancellor of the Federal Republic.</p>

                        </hi>. He had had great respect for <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> and
            for the great accomplishments of his life. However, he thought that <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> sometimes had taken too strong a stand vis-à-vis
            the Soviet Union. One did not want to close a door permanently just because somebody was
            trying to break in.</p>
                    <p>We had not thought of <hi rend="italic">

                        </hi> “as a softie”. We did not believe that he had neglected the interests of the
            German people. He was wise to see the danger of an isolationist trend which was growing
            in momentum in the US and he was willing to make certain concessions in an effort to
            head it off, just as we were trying to meet German interests on the question of the
            growing popularity of the <gloss target="#t_NPD1">NPD</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> had left a “good taste in our mouth.”</p>
                    <p>The American people were not angry with Germany. After 20 years of being committed all

                    <p>Chancellor Kiesinger asked about the 172 planes the US intended to withdraw from
            Germany.</p>
                    <p>The President said the figure was 144 and not 172.</p>
                    <p>Chancellor Kiesinger replied, 144 planes would be one-half of the US planes stationed
            here.</p>
                    <p>The President indicated his disapproval and pulled out a paper from which he determined
            that there were 662 planes of the US on European soil.</p>
                    <p>Chancellor Kiesinger replied he believed there were 288 US planes on German soil, thus
            it would be one-half of that figure.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HKG1">Von Hase</persName> interjected: withdrawing one-half
            of the US air force in Germany would have a strong psychological impact on the German
            Luftwaffe.</p>
                    <p>Chancellor Kiesinger said he believe this would not be the time to try and make any
            specific suggestions on this matter. He was not a military man.</p>
                    <p>The President asked him if he meant to say that he wanted to reserve this decision for
            the future, after more consultations on the expert level.</p>
                    <p>Chancellor Kiesinger answered yes, he would. They should not try to decide too many
            difficult problems all at once.</p>
                    <p>The President summarized that there were basically four problems he was concerned with

                    <p>First of all, he wanted to repeat the following: the US, as before, was in favor of
            German reunification; the US was determined to stand by Germany; the US was prepared and
            ready to defend Germany if that should become necessary; the US considered Germany a

                    </p>
                    <p>First, on the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>: the US had made the adjustments
            wanted by Germany; it was working together with German experts on this matter; it would
            not sign the treaty without prior consultations at the top level.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Secondly, on the question of consultation and trust, he would like to tell the
            Chancellor about the first meeting he had with Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>. At that time <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> had
            told him of his constant fears about the Soviet Union. He had then taken <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s hand and pledged to him the US would stand by
            his side against any aggression by the Soviet Union. That handshake was more important
            than any individual assurances. He had told them he would remain the friend of Germany.
            He was ready to renew this pledge to Chancellor Kiesinger. (The President then took the
            Chancellor's hand and shook it.)</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor thanked the President for this pledge.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>The President continued by emphasizing the importance to the US of a successful outcome
            of the liquidity talks. He said he expected that the Chancellor would not affect our
            position adversely.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Troop levels</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>In the fourth place, on the matter of troop levels, the President said, he expected
            understanding from the German side. He believed the Chancellor understood this problem
            well.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">German confidence in U.S.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>One matter which might well be more important than any of the above was the question of
            doubts. Statements about feeling neglected, lack of consultation, being guilty of
            complicity, etc., were doing much to hurt the standing of the German people in the
            United States. He reminded the Chancellor of what he had said before about the
            difference of saying something in privacy and having it all over the news media. He
            suggested also the Chancellor call him directly if he should ever have any serious
            doubts. What the press was writing was only helping his critics. It did not hurt him
            personally but he did not think it was good for the German people.</p>

                    <p>He was aware that the Soviet Union was trying to divide them any way they could.
            Equally, there were people in Europe trying to do the same. They were both smart enough
            not to be influenced by this. It was with this alliance (between the US and Germany)
            that the survival of freedom would best be served. If the Chancellor would stand by the
            US as we were loyal to Germany, nobody, neither the Soviet Union, nor <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> nor anybody else would be able to divide us. We
            believed that the future of Europe also depended on complete trust between Germany and
            the US.</p>
                    <p>He had never said anything unkind to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>
            but the General had told him to “get out,” and he had left quietly without creating a
            scene. They should not allow themselves to be swayed by the pronouncements of others.
            They were the Chief of State and as long as they stood together everything would be all

                    <p>There was no agreement on the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> yet. He would not

                    </p>
                    <p>The Chancellor expressed his agreement with the latter suggestion. He said it had been
            necessary for him to speak out on certain points. Sometimes it was impossible to remain
            silent. However, he knew a little better now to what extent each of his statements was
            being magnified by the news media in the US. He therefore agreed that it was good to
            exchange certain views in confidence.</p>
                    <p>The President agreed that it was necessary to speak up at times. One could not be a
            statesman without getting elected. One had to have the support of the people. One could
            not do much good without being in office.</p>

                    <p>Apart from the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>, the US was working in many areas
            for a different relationship with the Soviet Union. It had adopted a Space Treaty and
            was working on a Consular Treaty. The Consular Treaty was not only in the interest of
            the Soviet Union and of the United States but in the interest of the entire free world.
            The Soviets had plenty of people in the United <pb n="539" xml:id="pg_539" facs="0569"/>States. The US was interested in getting some of its people into the Soviet Union to
            be able to observe at close hand what was going on there.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Troop levels</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The President suggested that the Chancellor present his views on troop reduction and
            that they consider the question at the highest level. Both sides should give and take
            until a satisfactory solution could be found. Details were not so important, what
            counted was the handshake. That pledge would be honored “when the roll is called.”</p>
                    <p>The President and the Chancellor then agreed on what to say to the press after the
            meeting.</p>

                    <p>The President then repeated that he was making no “backroom deals” with anybody, that
            he believed there was strength in unity and disaster in division. They should not let
            themselves be driven apart by columnists or others.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>The Chancellor said that he was very gratified about this conversation. He wanted to
            repeat that he would do nothing that might damage the good relations between the two
            countries. As a matter of fact, he would try to strengthen those relations. He accepted
            gladly the President's suggestion to call on his advice and have joint talks and try to
            find solutions on any difficulties that might come up. He believed that the small
            worries of Germany and the uneasy feelings could be overcome. He believed that public
            opinion in Germany and in the US would move again in the direction of closer friendship.
            The President would always find understanding here. The majority of the German people
            were for the President because they knew that whatever happened to the US would happen
            to the entire free world.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>The President said he wanted to add one more thing. He wondered how big the German
            population was—sixty million? (The Chancellor nodded yes.) Those sixty million, he said,
            eat very well and are dressed very well but there were over three billion people in the
            world that were not faring so well. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> should think
            about sharing some more of its prosperity with, for instance, the people of Asia and
            support his food program. This might be worth a few squadrons to him.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor assured the President of the willingness of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> to cooperate as much as possible. He explained the restrictions placed on
            him by the bad financial situation of the Federal Government.</p>
                    <p>The President stated that the US was willing to give three million more tons of grain
            to India if the rest of the free world would match that <pb n="540" xml:id="pg_540" facs="0570"/>total together. He urged the Chancellor to do his utmost to support this
            program.</p>
                    <p>At this point, the conversation ended, having lasted a little over two hours.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Note</hi>: The conversation was preceded by a fifteen-minute social
            talk with the entire Kiesinger family, including Mr. Kiesinger's son-in-law from
            Washington. The atmosphere was very cordial. The President, during that conversation,
            extended an invitation to Mrs. Kiesinger to accompany her husband to the US.</p>
                    <p>The private conversation between the President and the Chancellor also was conducted
            for the most part in a very cordial manner. It was noticeable that the Chancellor was
            feeling slightly uneasy about the emphatic, determined and simply-worded delivery of the
            President's thoughts. He (the Chancellor) seemed unable to control the direction of the
            conversation as he normally does. However, toward the end much of this uneasiness seemed
            to dissipate and it became clear that the President had made a positive impression in
            many respects on the Chancellor. The President, on the other hand, appeared completely
            at ease throughout the conversation.</p>

              found. The telegram number appears to be incorrect.</note> Subject: German support for
            US position in international monetary reform.</p>
                    <p>1. I fully recognize the great importance that the administration places on the
            successful completion of negotiations on the basic framework of an acceptable plan for
            reform of the international monetary system in time for presentation to the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> Governors at their meeting in Rio de Janeiro in
            September. At the same time, my considered judgment is that the approach suggested in
            the reftel is the wrong way to try to advance our interests in this field, and, in fact,
            would be counter-productive.</p>
                    <pb n="541" xml:id="pg_541" facs="0571"/>
                    <p>2. The main point, I believe, is that if the battery of expert opinion and
            argumentation which was obviously marshalled in Washington for the April 24–26 meetings
            could not carry the day, there is little chance of our making any contribution to
            swinging the balance by organizing approaches of the kind suggested in the reftel. I
            believe that the discussions have now progressed to a point where it would no longer be
            effective simply to have influential people urge Chancellor Kiesinger to support the US
            view generally against that of France. This is the one confrontation that Kiesinger and
            the German Cabinet will seek to avoid at all costs. A break in the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> on this issue would be considered by the Germans only as
            a last resort, it could be accepted by them only on a showing that the French persisted
            in positions which threatened solutions that the Germans, in the light of their own
            interests, considered reasonable and desirable.</p>
                    <p>3. Kiesinger has little personal interest in this issue and no technical financial
            background on which to base an independent judgment. He has, to the best of our
            knowledge, no American confidants in such matters and relies on his government advisers:

                        <persName corresp="#p_SK6">Schiller</persName> and Econ State Sec Schoellhorn. If he
            has an outside adviser on such matters he is likely to be Prof Dr. Otto Pfleiderer,
            President of the State Central Bank of Baden-Wuerttemberg. We have a report on Dr.
            Pfleiderer's general financial views which indicates that he is very conservative and a
            strong supporter of Pres Blessing in the Bundesbank Council. He would not be likely to
            counsel the Chancellor to take any action not favored by Blessing and possibly Emminger.
            Neither, in my judgment, would any other influential German financial leader. We know,
            for example, that <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> opposes our position
            strongly.</p>
                    <p>4. There would, moreover, be a high probability that the approach suggested in the
            reftel would become known to Kiesinger and probably to <persName corresp="#p_SK6">Schiller</persName> as well. This would, in my opinion, be certain to arouse their
            resentment and that of their Cabinet colleagues. I have the distinct impression that
            there has already been some little annoyance at the totality of our actions mounted
            before the meeting of the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> Finance Ministers in
            Munich. It will be recalled that I directed a strong letter to the Chancellor, enclosing
            copies of Sec <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName>'s two letters to <persName corresp="#p_SK6">Schiller</persName>, on the eve of the meeting. I have never
            received a reply or any comment. The strong emphasis given to this subject by the Vice
            President before the Munich meeting, and by the President after, will have left no doubt
            as to where the US Government stands on this matter. Unless we have some persuasive new
            element to inject in support of our point of view, I can see no further advantage to be
            derived from additional general political type pressures.</p>
                    <p>5. To add the type of campaign now being suggested to what has already been done could,
            in my judgment, even arouse suspicion as to <pb n="542" xml:id="pg_542" facs="0572"/>our
            real purpose in seeking reform. When we originally proposed the reforms now under
            consideration, it was on the basis that additional reserves would be required because of
            our intent to balance our payments. Since it is now well known that we cannot attain a
            balance in the immediate future, it will be generally concluded that the urgency of the
            situation should have been diminished rather than increased. During the parallel
            discussions conducted with <persName corresp="#p_SK6">Schiller</persName> during the
            President's recent visit, the amount of new liquidity required annually was stated by
            the US side as being roughly comparable to that currently being injected by the US. For
            us now to press with what will be considered an unwarranted degree of urgency, may lead
            others to the conclusion that our real purpose is to facilitate our financing of a
            continuing large payments imbalance. The possible benefits which might accrue to us
            through such a campaign are not in my opinion worth this risk.</p>
                    <p>6. My own feeling is that the best way for us to advance the negotiations in the
            direction we desire is through our regular contacts at all appropriate levels. I and my
            staff will take advantage of our contacts with German Government officials, and German
            and American businessmen, to sell the US point of view on these matters. In order to be
            effective in this effort, we will need to be kept up to date on the progress of the
            negotiations and the evolution of the US viewpoint on the issues of the day.</p>

                        <placeName>Luxembourg</placeName>, <date when="1967-06-13T16:30:00Z">June 13, 1967,
              1630Z</date>.</dateline>
                    <p>470. Secto 05. <gloss target="#t_NATUS1">NATUS</gloss>. Secretary received Vice
            Chancellor Brandt for breakfast June 13, during which one hour conversation took place.
            Others present were Arnold (Brandt's Chef de Cabinet), <persName corresp="#p_WH3">Weber</persName> (Brandt's staff assistant), as well as <persName corresp="#p_BRJ1">Bowie</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_JAC1">Johnpoll</persName>. Major items
            discussed follow:</p>
                    <pb n="543" xml:id="pg_543" facs="0573"/>
                    <p>1. Non-proliferation treaty. Brandt asked whether Secretary to ask for any <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> action during course of current <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> meeting. Secretary replied he intended discuss
            status of draft but would not ask for any action. Secretary mentioned the two
            alternatives on amendment procedures, but Brandt gave no indication of <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> reaction or preference.</p>
                    <p>2. Middle East. Secretary told Brandt we had not expected shooting to begin when it
            did, particularly since Israelis had told us privately they would exercise restraint. We
            had, however, anticipated that if shooting began the outcome would be what it turned out
            to be. Secretary told Brandt he intended to discuss Middle East situation at <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Ministerial Meeting, particularly to illustrate current
            status of East-West relations. US and Soviet Union had been able to cooperate only to a
            very limited degree during the crisis, essentially only on the cease-fire. The Soviets
            had pushed the Arabs up to the closing of the Strait of Tiran; and they will now try to
            exploit the situation to enhance Soviet influence on the Arabs and to minimize Western
            influence. Secretary thought that it would be a long time before real peace comes to the
            area, with one side suffering from humiliation and the other from great pride.</p>
                    <p>Brandt said that <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> relations with the Near Eastern
            countries are poor on the whole. However, he thought <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
            relations had been affected less severely by the crisis than ours. Secretary said quite
            a few of the <gloss target="#t_NE1">NE</gloss> countries who had broken with us had done
            so as a public gesture but privately wished to maintain contact.</p>
                    <p>Secretary told Brandt there some indications, still inconclusive, that Soviet Union may
            ask special session <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>. Secretary and Brandt agreed
            that there evidence that Israeli Government had been seriously divided between activists
            and moderates before shooting began last week.</p>
                    <p>3. <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> role. Secretary expressed concern over <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> reluctance look after matter vital <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> interest even though out of immediate <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> geographic area. Said he hoped we could stimulate more
            continuing interest in these vital areas. France opposes common approach in principle,
            and feels <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> failed to help on Algeria, but <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> should nevertheless be concerned with its vital
            interests.</p>
                    <p>Brandt expressed general agreement and said he would have something to say during
              <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Ministerial about the need for crisis
            consultations. He was afraid, however, that there would be little enthusiasm. Even as
            far as Germany was concerned, <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> involvement might
            have some politically damaging consequences.</p>
                    <p>Secretary asked whether European interest might be fostered by Harmel's idea of trying
            to develop European caucus. Said that we would have no objection. Brandt thought it
            might. Both agreed that consultation didn't mean everyone must agree to act jointly. Of
            course, the general objective would have to be kept in mind. For example, some could
            counsel <pb n="544" xml:id="pg_544" facs="0574"/>moderation on Israel, others could seek
            to maintain contact with the Arabs.</p>
                    <p>4. Bilateral security consultation. Brandt suggested that Secretary designate someone
            to maintain contact with one or two <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> people to
            exchange and develop thoughts on development of Eur security system. On German side
            Brandt proposed the Chief of <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> Political
            Department or Planning Chief Diehl although not certain he would be available since
            Kiesinger wants him to replace <persName corresp="#p_HKG1">Von Hase</persName> as <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> Press Chief. Brandt said that in addition to the talks on
            Eur security system, he would be prepared to send someone to Washington to exchange
            views with us on developments in Eastern Europe and <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
            if we felt, as relayed to him by Embassy Bonn, that there had not been sufficient
            discussion of these matters.</p>
                    <p>Secretary suggested that <persName corresp="#p_BRJ1">Bowie</persName> hold preliminary
            discussions with <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> reps concerning Eur security
            problems, and subsequently talks could move to senior level, possibly during Kiesinger
            visit to Washington. Secretary asked Brandt whether he intended accompany Kiesinger.</p>
                    <p>Brandt replied he might not accompany Kiesinger since they have a general agreement not
            to go abroad together. However, Von Hase in announcing Kiesinger's acceptance of
            President's invitation had mistakenly said Brandt would accompany; it might be
            internally embarrassing if after this announcement Brandt failed to do so. In any event,
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> would probably decide within next few days.</p>
                    <p>Secretary indicated to Brandt we would welcome it if <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> decides Brandt to accompany Kiesinger. Said that as a general practice we
            had found it useful for SecState and <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> to hold
            discussions while President and Chancellor were conducting their talks.</p>
                    <p>5. East-West relations. Brandt told Secretary that <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
            would probably send brief reply to <persName corresp="#p_SW6">Stoph</persName>'s
            letter today.<note n="2" xml:id="d216fn2">
                            <persName corresp="#p_SW6">Stoph</persName> and Kiesinger exchanged four letters
              between May 10 and September 28. For texts, see <hi rend="italic">Europe Archiv,
                1967</hi>, vol. 2, pp. 327–330 and 473–477.</note> Did not expect it to lead to any
            immediate results but will be embarrassing to <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> because some of the Communist countries would welcome show of
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> flexibility. Brandt said Soviet Union had not
            slowed down <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> progress in developing <gloss target="#t_EE1">EE</gloss> contacts as drastically as had been feared two or three
            months ago. Shortly after the Karlsbad meeting,<note n="3" xml:id="d216fn3">Reference is
              to the April meeting of Communist Parties on the questions of Germany and European
              security. For extracts of the meeting's final statement, see <hi rend="italic">Documents on Germany, 1944–1985</hi>, pp. 961–963.</note> the Czechs had privately
            indicated to <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> desire for discussions, had not
            excluded eventual diplomatic relations, and had indicated that some intermediate
            solutions might be possible in the near future. Brandt thought that establishment of
            trade missions might be next step with the Czechs. Brandt said <pb n="545" xml:id="pg_545" facs="0575"/>that the Poles, potentially most difficult problem, also
            seem to be somewhat more flexible and undogmatic towards Bonn. Brandt said he had
            impression Soviets themselves were becoming a little less rigid toward the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. For example, <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName> had made some remarks at the Hanover Fair in favor of increased
            German-Soviet trade, using some of Brandt's own words on this subject. Brandt said that
            Soviet Embassy Bonn had sent two officers to the <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss>
                        <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Section to ask for <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> reaction to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> redeployment plan at
            about same time two Soviet EmbOffs had called on US Embassy Bonn. Brandt said these Sov
            EmbOffs had made a vague statement to <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
                        <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> that time might come when Soviet Union might
            not necessarily have to keep troops in <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> at present
            level.</p>
                    <p>Secretary said we had not approached Soviets on question of mutual troop withdrawals
            because we have nothing to offer Soviets. <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
            redeployment is too small to interest Soviets, and we intend to maintain current
            effectiveness <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> forces. In response to Secretary's
            question Brandt said <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> had no information to indicate
            reduction Soviet troop levels in East Germany.</p>
                    <p>6. Free world exports to China. Secretary told Brandt we hoped to discuss with
            authoritative Germans—perhaps Brandt and Schroeder—contributions being made by free
            world to Chinese nuclear program by export metallurgical and other essential items.
            These items not covered by <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> but <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> exports involved.
            Japanese have already been briefed. Secretary said we hoped to send briefing team to
            Bonn in near future.</p>
                    <p>7. Common Market. Brandt said <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>'s
            objection to British entry is political. Brandt had told <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName> in Rome that <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> could make important
            contribution in East-West relations, but <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName> had replied that <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would do nothing
            without US permission. Nevertheless, Brandt said he and Kiesinger believed <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> understands he cannot have his way against the
            weight of European public opinion. Even in France substantial number of Gaullists
            disagree with their chief on British entry.</p>
                    <p>Brandt said that the French had not only gone along with the selection of Rey but that
            last April <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve de Murville</persName> had suggested Rey's
            name to Brandt as a compromise candidate. Secretary and Brandt agreed that French
            behavior during Kennedy Round had been encouraging.</p>

                            Quadripartite supper meeting between Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and Foreign Ministers <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve de Murville</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BG4">Brown</persName> and Brandt. It serves
            as approved memorandum of conversation.</p>
                    <p>1. <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> efforts with East Germany—After brief discussion
            Middle East situation and speculation about possible special <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> session (to be reported septel) Brandt led off discussion on <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> relations with East Berlin regime and their effects on
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> relations with Soviet Union and <gloss target="#t_EE1">EE</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Brandt said that since December <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting,
              <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> has increasingly followed policy
            isolation vis-à-vis <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss>. This dominated recent
              <gloss target="#t_SED1">SED</gloss> Congress. Clearly, ruling group in East Berlin
            does not want contact with <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. Nevertheless <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> is offering contacts; accepted <persName corresp="#p_SW6">Stoph</persName> letter; and today has sent reply.<note n="2" xml:id="d217fn2">See <ref target="#d216fn2">footnote 2, Document 216</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Brandt said <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> not optimistic regarding reaction to
            reply, but aims to convince its allies, neutral countries, and other Communist states
            that <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> willing to accept reasonable modus vivendi.
            Seeks to reach agreements where these are possible, is willing put aside problems on
            which agreement not possible, but cannot accede to <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> demand that his regime be accepted by Germans as foreign country
            or that it be legitimated on democratic or national grounds.</p>
                    <p>Brandt said it would mean much to <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> if allies would
            regard its moves with respect to East Berlin regime as German contribution to détente
            but not as signal to treat that part of Germany as separate state.</p>
                    <p>2. <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_EE1">EE</gloss>
            relations—Brandt then described current state of <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
            relations with <gloss target="#t_EE1">EE</gloss>. Said that after new <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> Government had undertaken policy of improving
            Eastern relations, <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> regime and Soviets had
            taken counter measures which have slowed up progress but have not destroyed the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> policy or its future prospects. Brandt said there was
            considerable evidence of continued interest in <gloss target="#t_EE1">EE</gloss> for
            developing relations with <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. For example, after
            Karlsbad conference, Czech privately contacted <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> reps
            for exchange of views. Brandt thought this might lead to exchange of trade missions and
            perhaps more. Poland has made some private contacts, but Brandt not very optimistic
            early progress <pb n="547" xml:id="pg_547" facs="0577"/>could be expected here. Thought
            diplomatic relations would come with Czechs and Hungarians before Poles. Yugoslavs eager
            for diplomatic relations, but <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> has not yet found the
            right formula.</p>
                    <p>Brandt said <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> wishes to put more emphasis on
            improving relations with Soviet Union. There are some signs, he said, that Soviet
            attitude toward <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> has recently become less aggressive.
            Said he expects to see Tsarapkin June 15 and will explore Soviet attitudes further.</p>
                    <p>Brandt said it more apparent now than six months ago that <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> must make clear to Communist countries that it not seeking to isolate
              <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> regime from rest of Soviet bloc. Brandt
            said he thought there might be some Soviet interest in <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> proposal re exchange of declarations on non-use of force on matters
            relating to the German problem. <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> might be willing, if
            Soviet interest develops, to extend declaration not only to <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> but also to her allies. He anticipated that Soviets might in that event
            ask whether <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> declaration would also be binding
            on allied troops stationed on German soil. Of course the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> answer would have to be “no.” Brandt, responding to Secretary's query,
            said Berlin would also be excluded and Allied rights unimpaired. Brandt thought it might
            be useful for <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> to explore entire question with US,
              <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and France.</p>
                    <p>3. Reply to <persName corresp="#p_SW6">Stoph</persName> letter—<persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve de Murville</persName> at this point stated that he had read
            the reply to <persName corresp="#p_SW6">Stoph</persName>, and thought it a good
            letter. He called it an important step. While he wasn't at all sure there would be a
            reply from the other side, the document was important as a new definition of <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> position. <persName corresp="#p_BG4">Brown</persName>
            said he agreed. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> asked Brandt what
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> intended to do if <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> regime replied that its Ministers were prepared to talk with
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> Ministers.</p>
                    <p>Brandt said that <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> intention was to use State
            Secretaries, but that if prospects were otherwise favorable, and some technical subjects
            come up within the competence of certain Ministers (e.g. Minister of Communications), he
            did not rule that out. Contact between Ministers of Foreign Affairs was out of the
            question, however.</p>
                    <p>Secretary asked Brandt whether he had had any private indications re possible reaction
            of <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> regime to the letter.</p>
                    <p>Brandt replied that the dominant group, which holds very rigid views, would have
            preferred to receive no answer. Now this group will have to debate with less doctrinaire
            colleagues as well as with other bloc countries. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
            letter is being published on June 14 together with a <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
            declaration of policy.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> asked whether it would be useful
            to discuss this problem with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> if latter
            comes to NY in near future. Brandt thought that it would be useful if we could let
              <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> know that we thought well of current
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> efforts to develop contacts with the other part of
            Germany.</p>
                    <pb n="548" xml:id="pg_548" facs="0578"/>
                    <p>Secretary said he felt line <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> was taking was
            constructive and well reflected the confidence of <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> and its population. Thought it useful for <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> to stay a step ahead of East on this matter.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BG4">Brown</persName> agreed with Secretary. Said he was impressed
            during recent visit in Moscow by extent to which Soviets had changed in their reaction
            to Bonn. Thought that Soviets would continue anti-<gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> propaganda but more quietly than before. When he had supported <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> people like Brandt, <persName corresp="#p_WH6">Wehner</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_EF4">Erler</persName> in talks with the
            Russians, the Russians had replied skeptically, but without invective, that they would
            wait and see.</p>
                    <p>4. On question of Soviet attitudes, Secretary said he had impression until blocking of
            Straits of Tiran that there was quite a debate between moderates and militants taking
            place in Moscow. He asked whether current developments in Middle East would tend to
            discredit the militants. Had someone in Soviet Union made serious mistake in estimate of
            Arab military ability?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BG4">Brown</persName> thought that the militants in Moscow might
            be strengthened rather than weakened. Nevertheless, someone will be called to account in
            Moscow for the mistaken judgement that the Arabs could take care of themselves
            militarily against Israel.</p>
                    <p>Secretary asked whether Soviets have the mistaken impression that we control Israel and
            had acted in bad faith in telling Soviets we would counsel moderation. <persName corresp="#p_BG4">Brown</persName> said he was convinced Soviet leaders knew we did not
            control Israel.</p>
                    <p>5. Berlin morale—Brandt then reverted to Berlin. Said he was worried that situation
            there was deteriorating psychologically. Economic problem did not seem so serious at
            present. Berlin unemployment lower than in <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. Brandt
            pointed to recent Berlin student demonstrations, said these were more or less the same
            students who in 1961 and 1962 had risked their lives against the Wall and to rescue
            their compatriots. That these students are now turning their energy to destructive
            demonstration results from the psychological frustrations which are becoming a serious
            problem in Berlin. Brandt thought that in addition to the factors making for unrest
            among the students everywhere, Berlin presented special problems. After a genuine
            détente comes, Berlin will find a new role to play. Until then, it will suffer from
            frustrations. Brandt said that of course the plight of the civilian population of Berlin
            in this respect is an <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> problem. <persName corresp="#p_BG4">Brown</persName> said that any organization suffers a letdown after
            release from the tensions of crisis; in the absence of crisis, it is inevitable that the
            spirit of Berlin would be subdued.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> thought that Berlin suffers from
            the fact that an illusion of détente has been created without the reality. As a result,
            Berlin at present has neither the stimulus of crisis nor the opportunities that would
            come with genuine détente.</p>
                    <pb n="549" xml:id="pg_549" facs="0579"/>
                    <p>Brandt said that the Berlin government would set up a committee to work out various
            ways of putting new life into the city. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> would
            cooperate. He asked that US, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and French reps in Berlin
            show sympathetic interest in the activities and plans of the committee when it is
            established. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> thought it might be
            possible to make greater use of Berlin for international meetings of a technical or
            cultural nature. This might be psychologically useful. He also suggested that Brandt
            talk to the three Ambassadors in Bonn to explore quietly what can be done to help
            ameliorate the situation.</p>

              1850Z</date>.</dateline>
                    <p>15024. Subj: Conversation with <persName corresp="#p_WH6">Wehner</persName>. I had an
            hour with All-German Affairs Minister <persName corresp="#p_WH6">Wehner</persName> on
            June 19.</p>
                    <p>1. The <persName corresp="#p_SW6">Stoph</persName> letter and its aftermath—I said
            that I was aware of the importance which <persName corresp="#p_WH6">Wehner</persName>
            attached to the reply to the <persName corresp="#p_SW6">Stoph</persName> letter and
            congratulated him on having won his point. <persName corresp="#p_WH6">Wehner</persName>
            said a corner had been turned; however, there would be many others. A majority of the
            leadership of the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_CSU1">CSU</gloss> Parliamentary group had fought to the last to prevent a reply. If
              <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>'s answer provided an opening, the fight
            would be on again.</p>
                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_WH6">Wehner</persName> said that while Neues Deutschland had
            been sharply negative, <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> had been much more
            flexible. <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> would be clever enough to put
            the ball back in the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>'s court. He might agree to
            appoint a delegate for the purpose of discussing with his <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> counterpart arrangements for a meeting between Kiesinger and <persName corresp="#p_SW6">Stoph</persName>. In this event, <persName corresp="#p_WH6">Wehner</persName> said that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> should respond
            positively. There was at this juncture no need to envisage a meeting between Kiesinger
            and <persName corresp="#p_SW6">Stoph</persName>. The meetings of the delegates could
            be strung out for a long time, and serve precisely the purpose desired by the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, i.e., a discussion of practical <pb n="550" xml:id="pg_550" facs="0580"/>measures to prevent a widening of the gap. If these
            discussions reached a promising stage, a meeting on the Ministerial or sub-Ministerial
            (State Secretary) level could be held. <persName corresp="#p_WH6">Wehner</persName>
            defined science and transport as substantive fields for initial discussions and
            indicated that Kiesinger had accepted in principle this idea that Minister of Transport
            Leber could hold discussions with his East German counterpart once there were prospects
            for concrete results. Postal affairs could be another subject of discussion if it were
            not for Minister Dollinger's adamant opposition.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_WH6">Wehner</persName> said that an <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> reply along the lines indicated above would lead again to a
            strong negative reaction of a majority of the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_CSU1">CSU</gloss>. However, if this Chancellor led, the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_CSU1">CSU</gloss> would fall into line.
            If, on the other hand, he sought the advice of his party, there would be mounting
            opposition and long delays.</p>
                    <p>4. The Soviet attitude—Asked whether there were any indication of a more flexible
            Soviet attitude toward the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_WH6">Wehner</persName> said the Soviets were taking the position “Why are
            you in such a hurry?”. He said that the two leading Soviet journalists who had visited
            the <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> last March had finally written their
            articles. The tone was patronizing; the German problem had not yet sufficiently matured
            for a solution; moreover, there were other more important problems. In <persName corresp="#p_WH6">Wehner</persName>'s opinion, if the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> persisted in its attempts to create motion on the German problem, the
            Soviets eventually would have to become involved. They were already showing some
            interest in the proposal for a mutual renunciation of the use of force, although they
            were suggesting that this should be done directly between “the two German states.” Also,
            Kiesinger's astute and repeated denials that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, in
            its Eastern policy, was attempting to sow discord in Eastern Europe, and between the
            Eastern European countries and the Soviets, undoubtedly were having some effect.</p>
                    <p>5. Berlin—I noted that <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> Brandt had talked
            about the Berlin situation at the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting at
              Luxembourg,<note n="2" xml:id="d218fn2">See <ref target="#d217">Document
              217</ref>.</note> and that the Secretary had indicated that we would like to be of
            help. <persName corresp="#p_WH6">Wehner</persName> said that there was no major morale
            problem; some substantive problems had to be met. Important industrial investments had
            been cancelled and this had led to unrest among the labor force. There was also the
            student problem, but this was a general phenomenon throughout Germany. On top of this,
            the Berlin press was highly irresponsible and overdramatized the issues. <persName corresp="#p_WH6">Wehner</persName> said that Minister <persName corresp="#p_SK6">Schiller</persName> would probably discuss in Washington the possibility of holding
            more international meetings in Berlin. This would be of some help. Discussions were also
            taking place with the industrialists (Berg) for a more determined effort to maintain
            investments <pb n="551" xml:id="pg_551" facs="0581"/>in the city. The <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> was now paying greater attention to the student problem,
            with good effects.</p>
                    <p>6. Voting rights for Berlin Deputies—<persName corresp="#p_WH6">Wehner</persName> said
            that he and Brandt had killed a proposal to discuss voting rights for Berlin Deputies
            during this week's meeting of Bundestag committees in Berlin. They had taken the
            position that there would have to be preparatory discussion with the Allies before the
            Bundestag could consider the problem and that the time was not ripe for such
            discussions. He had just learned that Bundestag President Gerstenmaier, in Berlin, had
            called attention to the tripartite opinion on the Niekisch case. <persName corresp="#p_WH6">Wehner</persName> indicated that he had full understanding for the
            tripartite position and sharply criticized Gerstenmaier for having played up this issue.
            He said it was precisely this kind of unhelpful action which affected morale in Berlin.
            I said that we had a good record of finding practical solutions to such problems in
            Berlin. <persName corresp="#p_WH6">Wehner</persName> agreed.</p>
                    <p>7. The <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> and the coalition—In response to my question
            about the current mood in the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> and the situation
            within the coalition, <persName corresp="#p_WH6">Wehner</persName> said that there had
            been difficulties within the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> but these were being
            contained. There would be no extraordinary party convention. Instead, the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> convention would be advanced from the autumn to the
            spring of 1968 and a meeting of elected delegates would be held this autumn. This would
            permit people to blow off steam.</p>
                    <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_WH6">Wehner</persName> said that unnecessary statements by
            spokesmen of both parties created friction within the coalition. On the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> side, Helmut Schmidt, in his free and easy manner, was
            constantly repeating that there would be an <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss>
            Chancellor in 1969. This kind of brave talk, reminiscent of “casino language of reserve
            officers,” irritated Kiesinger who had queried Brandt whether the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> was toying with the idea of a coalition with the <gloss target="#t_FDP1">FDP</gloss>. State Secretary Jahn had recently called into question
            the Chancellor's authority to issue binding policy guidelines, arguing that under the
            grand coalition there had to be prior agreement between the two partners. Whether
            well-intentioned or not, public discussion of these problems was harmful as it
            immediately led to counter pressures from the other side. This merely embittered the
            atmosphere and served no useful purpose.</p>
                    <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_WH6">Wehner</persName> said that medium term financial
            planning and the financial reform were the most serious substantive problems currently
            confronting the coalition. A full day Cabinet meeting would be held on these problems on
            July 5. Painful decisions were required. In such a situation there was always room for
            demagoguery. <persName corresp="#p_WH6">Wehner</persName> indicated that he opposed
            those who argued that since there would have to be cuts in the social security budget,
            the defense budget should also be reduced. These were not comparable issues. <persName corresp="#p_WH6">Wehner</persName> also noted a tendency on the part of the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_CSU1">CSU</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> Parliamentary groups to conclude deals between <pb n="552" xml:id="pg_552" facs="0582"/>themselves in order to defeat unpopular but
            necessary economy measures proposed by the govt. If this tendency continued, the
            coalition might find itself in serious difficulties.</p>
                    <p>Comment: Throughout the discussion, <persName corresp="#p_WH6">Wehner</persName> was
            frank and candid. He was obviously pleased that he had won his point on the <persName corresp="#p_SW6">Stoph</persName> reply and appeared as firm as ever in his support
            for the grand coalition. At the same time he made it clear that he would continue to
            insist on using every opening that promised motion on the German problem. <persName corresp="#p_WH6">Wehner</persName>'s expectations on East German and Soviet reactions
            is probably overly optimistic, reflecting the great importance that he attaches to
            motion on the German problem.</p>

              to the source text, Benjamin Read, Executive Secretary of the Department of State,
              noted: “Although we have every reason to believe that Mr. Obst is accurate in
              recalling the statement, subsequent information including a check with Ambassador
                <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> indicates that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName>'s statement should have been qualified to
              indicate that there had been no decision on troop cut levels.”</note>

                    <p>
                        <persName>George</persName> will want to talk to you about the German defense cuts.
            Specifically, he will ask for guidance on what to say to Kiesinger when he returns to
            Bonn.</p>
                    <p>The Germans have clearly got the message that we are unhappy. They are coming in on
            every channel with assurances that there has been no decision on troop cuts. In any
            case, it will take them the rest of the summer to figure out how best to save the money
            without getting into a war with us.</p>
                    <p>In light of the above, my strong instinct would be to play the hand in low key—for the
            time being. If we keep hitting them hard during the next several weeks, I think we
            simply play into the hands of the Gaullists in Bonn, whose strongest card is German
            pride and vanity (“it's high time to assert independence from big brother, etc.”). A
            secondary point is that we badly need German cooperation in the international money
            negotiations between now and September.</p>

                    <p>If you agree with the above, you will want to instruct <persName>George</persName> (who
            may be in a rather combative mood vis-à-vis the Germans) to play it softly, and to say
            to Kiesinger that:</p>
                    <p>—You were deeply concerned by the press reports about the defense budget and troop
            cuts.</p>
                    <p>—Any unilateral action would undo all the work in the Trilaterals. It would certainly
            play into the hands of those in the US who want to reduce the American commitment in
            Europe.</p>
                    <p>—You were reassured by Kiesinger's message about no decision on troops and about his
            intention to consult before doing anything that will affect the common defense.<note n="3" xml:id="d220fn3">See <ref target="#d219fn2">footnote 2, Document
              219</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>—We sympathize with German worries about the state of their economy.
              (<persName>George</persName> might also say to Kiesinger—though not as coming from the
            President—that the economists in Washington are puzzled about the case for budget
            balancing at a time of recession in Germany, especially given the large German
            balance-of-payments surplus.)</p>
                    <p>—You look forward to seeing the Chancellor in Washington in September. Until then, you
            hope that the two governments will remain in very close touch.</p>
                    <p>I would advise against you taking personal notice of the press stories that we didn't
            consult about the aircraft rotation. As you know from my memo of yesterday,<note n="4" xml:id="d220fn4">Not further identified.</note> I have already made the point through
            the Embassy here.</p>

                    <p>698. Subj: Meeting with Brandt. <gloss target="#t_NATUS1">NATUS</gloss>. I called on
              <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> Brandt today at my request. The following
            topics were discussed:</p>
                    <p>1) Defense budget. Brandt said that he did not know precisely how the present
            unfortunate situation resulting from the defense budget decision had come about. There
            had been confusion and misunderstanding all around. The issue of “a change in defense
            concept” resulting from the budget decision had been injected into the Cabinet
            discussion by FinMin <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName>, but was included in
            the decision report only by accident. It will not be included in the final action. One
            thing he is sure of, however, is that the agreed overall defense budget figure will not
            be changed. He expects that the Germans will start discussions with respect to any
            changes in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> commitments in September. This will be
            well in time for the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> force planning and strategic
            decisions which will be taken in December.</p>
                    <p>There are several points of view, Brandt said, with respect to what steps the Germans
            should take in light of their defense budget decision. There is one point of view, which
            apparently includes the U.S. Congress, which is concerned principally with the number of
            divisions involved. General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> tends,
            however, to look to the effectiveness rather than the number of divisions. Brandt
            believes that we should take into account the fact that there will be at least three or
            four days warning time and that “several divisions” might be left in skeleton form to be
            filled up in an emergency within the alert period. Although <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> is, in general, not interested in reserves as such, he might be
            interested in such divisions. Another proposal is to fold the territorial forces into
            the Bundeswehr.</p>
                    <p>2) German public attitude. I asked the <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> how he
            could explain the apparent general apathy on the part of the German public to the
            defense cuts. I had been told that 64 percent believe that the cuts should be deeper.
            Brandt replied that there was no simple answer to my question. Since there had been no
            crises since that in Berlin in 1961–62, many considered there to be no immediate danger.
            Others believe a better defense can, with changes in the organization or concept, be
            obtained for less money. He did not believe that there was any general feeling that
              <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> in its present form had outlived its usefulness
            and required major <pb n="556" xml:id="pg_556" facs="0586"/>revision. This feeling,
            should it ever come, will come much later and only after a change in the situation in
            Eastern Europe.</p>
                    <p>3) European security. I referred to recent public remarks Brandt had made regarding a
            European security system, particularly his statement on July 2. Did this represent a
            coherent plan which the German Government might put forward? Brandt replied to the
            contrary, stating that his remarks had indeed only been “tactical starting points.” He
            felt that they must not leave the search for peace as a monopoly for the other side.
            Brandt had recently told <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve de Murville</persName> that
            he was opposed to calling a peace conference, as had been recently proposed by French
            Prime Min <persName corresp="#p_PG5">Pompidou</persName>. This must come later. Brandt
            said that he is currently more interested in the substance of peace securing
            arrangements, concerning which his thinking has focused on the following points:</p>
                    <p>A) The renunciation of the use of force</p>
                    <p>B) Making clear that Germany is not aiming at ownership of nuclear weapons</p>
                    <p>C) The search for East-West arrangements which could result in a reciprocal lowering of
            troop levels without disadvantages to either side.</p>
                    <p>These are matters which <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> itself is seized with,
            and in which the Germans are already cooperating. In the meantime, no drastic changes in
              <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> are required. Brandt regrets the fact that
            unilateral decisions are in the meanwhile being taken in the West through reduction in
            forces, without obtaining corresponding Soviet reductions. Indeed, he opposed the recent
            budgetary cuts as <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> for this reason—even though,
            as <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> leader, he had to support them in the end. Brandt
            said that the Chancellor's recent statement to the effect that a reunified Germany could
            not be a member of either power bloc, reflected the view that the German question cannot
            be solved within the present context of East-West confrontation. This does not mean,
            however, that Germany would withdraw from <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. Indeed,
            Germany could not withdraw from anything unless, at the same time, it enters something
            new. (I interpret this to mean either East-West security framework or a situation in
            which the East-West confrontation has disappeared.)</p>
                    <p>4) <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> visit.<note n="2" xml:id="d221fn2">July 12–13.</note> According to Brandt, the discussions during the recent <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> visit went quite well in the bilateral field.
            The principal gain had been in the creation of organizational structures for intensified
            cooperation in the industrial and technical areas. In the political field, the talks had
            resulted in agreement for a greater exchange of information between the two affecting
            Eastern Europe, including telegrams received by both from their Embassies. (It is
            interesting to note that the <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> has (Embtel
              523)<note n="3" xml:id="d221fn3">Dated July 13. (Department of State, Central Files,
                <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_GER1">GER</gloss> W–US)</note> recently declined our offer for
            intensified intelligence exchange <pb n="557" xml:id="pg_557" facs="0587"/>affecting
            Eastern Europe.) With regard to the big political issues, however, the situation after
            the meeting remains as before. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> had
            emphasized that the two countries must defend their national identities. Referring to
            “our American friends,” which Brandt thought an amusing slip, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> said that he did not think they aimed at
            domination, but that they were so big that they could not avoid it. The Germans, for
            their part, had said that they were concerned only with the threat imposed by the
            Soviets. With regard to England, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> had
            posed the question “What is England?”, mentioning Singapore and Hong Kong. He had warned
            against the special relationship between the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and US
            and the threat of an Atlantic Europe. Brandt said that the attitude of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> toward <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> entry
            posed a serious problem for Germany, which would become more acute before the end of the
            year. With regard to the Middle East, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>
            revealed the French objective as being basically to establish a presence there, without
            being too specific as to what it could accomplish. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName> is convinced that the Arabs will not stick together in the long run.
            In Brandt's view, it is not possible for Europe in its present state of organization to
            form a common policy toward the Middle East—or other similar problems.</p>
                    <p>5. Common Market political cooperation. Brandt pointed out that the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> Ministers had in their meeting on May 30 agreed to
            consider the question of political cooperation, not however any particular subject.
            Brandt does not know how far France will be willing to go in discussing particular
            political questions. The Six Foreign Ministers will meet again towards the end of
            October and will attempt to arrange another heads of state meeting before the end of the
            year. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> had asked Kiesinger to take the
            initiative in proposing such a meeting. Brandt is contacting the Italians to check the
            possibility of their proposing Luxembourg as the meeting place. He is, however, not
            optimistic that the meeting will take place, since the Dutch are reluctant to take part
            in such a meeting without progress on <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> admission. In
            the event no progress is made in the next Council Ministerial Meeting, Brandt will
            attempt to convince the Dutch that this is a necessity.</p>

                    <p>This will be a critical meeting—not quite in a league with Glassboro,<note n="2" xml:id="d222fn2">Reference is to the June 23 and 25 Summit meetings between President

            close enough to call for very careful preparation. And, in my judgment, the general
            impression we make will be much more important to future German behavior than what we
            say on any of the specific issues on the table. If we seem to have no broad, coherent
            approach to our European relations, or if we appear disorganized and uncertain about our
            priorities—or if we seem unaware of the sense of drift and uncertainty in Europe—we will
            lose what I think is a major opportunity to condition Kiesinger's thought and action on
            the full range of Atlantic issues.</p>
                    <p>The only way to be certain that we will speak with vision and with one voice is for the
            President to give clear marching orders. The rest of this memo sets out a strategy we
            might follow and a procedure whereby you could instruct us.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Strategy</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Kiesinger must leave this meeting convinced that:</p>
                    <p>—the President has a set of firm principles in his head which govern U.S. behavior
            toward Europe and the Russians;</p>
                    <p>—those principles are broadly consistent with German interests;</p>
                    <p>—they will not permit America to turn its back on Germany and Europe;</p>
                    <p>—specifically, the U.S. is not going to scuttle the Alliance whenever the Germans do
            something which annoys us;</p>
                    <p>—in turn, when we are forced by our problems to do something the Germans don't like, it
            does not mean that we are going to sue for divorce.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">It follows that the President should:</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>1. Lay out for Kiesinger—and draw him into a dialogue about—the basic components of our
            European policy:</p>
                    <p>—Our solid commitment to Atlantic security in the context of an evolving <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>—Our commitment to bridge building and general improvement of the East-West environment
            as the best way to create conditions in which <pb n="559" xml:id="pg_559" facs="0589"/>the healing of Germany is possible (it being understood that we will take our cue from
            the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> on sensitive East German issues).</p>
                    <p>—Our need to keep open our bilateral channel with the Russians, which reflects our
            special nuclear responsibilities.</p>
                    <p>—Our support for an increasingly coherent and effective Western Europe.</p>
                    <p>2. On the tough, sensitive issues: the future of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>,
            German unification, etc., probe in detail what is on Kiesinger's mind.</p>
                    <p>3. Use this kind of a conversation as the context in which to raise the currently hot
            issues (defense budget, troops, international money, future offset, etc.) and for
            getting across the general point that we both must be careful not to overload each
            other's politics; that isolationism breeds isolationism.</p>
                    <p>The point of the above strategy is to avoid limiting the conversation either to the hot
            questions of the day, or to a broad benign exchange which ignores both current troubles
            and the more fundamental strains which are inevitable in our relations with Europe
            following the excessive dependence of the post-war period.</p>
                    <p>If Kiesinger goes away without being confident that he understands what is really
            important to the President—and that he can depend on us not to overkill him on day to
            day problems—no amount of pleading or browbeating will make him more amenable on
            concrete issues as they arise. For instance, without such a framework a U.S. threat to
            cut troops might only draw a shrug and an air of bitter resignation. On the other hand,
            if the President can give the Chancellor a sense of confidence that he can calculate
            U.S. reactions to specific problems because he understands our general priorities, we
            will have a much better basis on which to lean on him, and to get him to lean on his
            anti-Americans when we have a specific problem.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Benefits</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>If the strategy works, the Chancellor will leave thinking that—whatever discordant
            noises there may be in the background—<persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon
              Johnson</persName> understands the central propositions necessary to a good, workable
            relation between Europe and America, and can be counted on to steer a true course
            despite periodic flaps. It's quite possible that this would even show up in the
            newspapers. Further,</p>
                    <p>—it would maximize the chance that Kiesinger will try to play particular issues our
            way;</p>
                    <p>—when he cannot do what we want, he will be more careful to manage German policy so as
            to minimize the negative effect on us;</p>
                    <p>—when we must do things he doesn't like, rather than blasting away in public, he will
            be more inclined to deal quietly with us, in private. Fundamentally, he will work harder
            to keep U.S.-German relations on an even keel.</p>

            to cross-examine your advisers, to instruct us on the general line, and also on the

                    <p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt</persName>:</p>
                    <p>I have been increasingly impressed by the importance of the coming talks with Kiesinger
            so much so that I am taking the liberty of writing you directly in the thought that you
            might convey some of my concern and some of my thinking to the President in preparation
            for the visit.</p>
                    <p>We are at a point of history where some very important decisions must be taken soon in
            respect of the Alliance and Germany, as an extremely important part of Europe, is one of
            the focal points on which a number of these far-reaching decisions have to be made.</p>
                    <p>The Alliance is coming up for review in 1969. Perhaps the review will be precipitated
            in 1968 by a formal notice of the renunciation of the Alliance by France. There are some
            in this country who are already advocating “some dilution of the Alliance” in the form
            of a détente with the Soviet Union. There are others who instinctively favor a return to
            a form of opportunistic isolationism on our part. There are those who feel that
            difficult as the prospect of reinvigorating <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> in the
            light of the French defection appears to be, that it is still the best clear chance for
            peace and security and for a reasonable modus vivendi with the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>deGaulle has not only defected from <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, he is from
            all the signs seeking an outright reversal of the Alliance.<note n="2" xml:id="d223fn2">Maybe this is too strong, but it certainly is an outright neutralization of the
              Alliance. [Footnote in the source text.]</note> On top of this, we have an equivocal
            position on the part of Germany—equivocal due in part to a domestic political diversion
            which has taken the form of a pro-French-pro-U.S. division in Germany. This division has
            become a bit overheated by a very strong and very virulent campaign on the part of
            France to convince the Germans that the only way they can prove their loyalty to the
            Franco-German treaty is to follow the French lead in its present anti-American phobia.
            There is also some equivocation apparent in respect to the German Government's attitude
            toward the East as has been evidenced by some recent speeches of Brandt and even in some
            of Kiesin-ger's.</p>
                    <pb n="562" xml:id="pg_562" facs="0592"/>
                    <p>A new phenomenon has entered into the picture in the form of the emergence of the
            Soviet Union in the Middle East and the Mediterranean as an aggressive political force
            there. It is clear that the Soviets intend to expand their position there if only to
            remove the sting of their miscalculation of the Israeli capacities. They intend to gain
            a position, if possible, which will enable them to influence the flow of oil from the
            area. They have seen the long-range potentialities of new pro-Soviet forces on the
            southern flank of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and astride the strategic nexus
            which the Mediterranean represents between the East and the West and between Europe and
            Africa. This only accentuates the pressing need for the Germans and the Americans to
            understand each other's objectives very clearly at this critical period in the history
            of the Alliance. The Soviets have not become benign merely because they seek to avoid a
            nuclear exchange. Their actions in the Middle East clearly demonstrate this.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand they have been hearing much from us on the subject of détente with
            the Soviet Union. This is not only in the nuclear field but in other areas as well. The
            article by Gilpatric in the Sunday Times will set them off again. What are our
            intentions? They are not going to be satisfied with general protestations any more than
            we should be. The Germans are great ones to insist on new assurances every week, but in
            the political world in which Europe moves, I have no doubt our position seems equivocal
            and disturbing too.</p>
                    <p>The important thing is to achieve, if at all possible, a real meeting of the minds as
            to what our respective objectives really are and what steps should be taken to bring
            them about. What do we intend to do about the Alliance if France does withdraw? What are
            the actual steps Brandt has in mind to take in furtherance of his long-range objectives
            in respect of the East? What do we really wish the Germans would do in respect of
            France?</p>
                    <p>It is important also to understand what should be avoided at the meeting. I suppose all
            would agree that we should not start out by berating the Chancellor for the reduction of
            his forward budget. We should not, I repeat, not, attempt to replay the record of the
            Erhardt visit. I doubt that it would be wise to even bring up offsets again. We should
            not take the budget cut as a new excuse to move in on our own troop levels. If we did
            this so close to the 1969 date, I think the base for a convincing reconfirmation of the
            Alliance and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> would be too dangerously narrowed. I
            should assume that the tripartite agreements carried us beyond the need for that. It was
            implicit in them that we would not proceed unilaterally toward the reduction of troop
            levels except in conjunction with each other and with a real discussion of what the
            strategic and tactical needs were. It was also agreed that the Foreign Exchange problem
            was a common problem. I would leave it at that assuming that both they and we intended
            to operate under those principles. This whole issue is one <pb n="563" xml:id="pg_563" facs="0593"/>which is so dependent on what our long-range objectives in respect of
            Europe and the Soviet Union are that the time should be spent in exploring those
            objectives in real depth rather than threatening further troop reductions or bickering
            with them over the budgetary developments or the way they handled the deGaulle
            visit.</p>
                    <p>We have a real opportunity now with the decline of deGaulle's prestige to begin now to
            lay a base for more meaningful discussion of our relations with Germany and Western
            Europe than we have had for some time. The disenchantment with deGaulle in Germany goes
            very deep and if we can show Europe that in spite of our domestic problems and with Viet
            Nam, we are prepared to think seriously of our future relations with Europe, this will
            be impressive. At the same time we ask that they be aware of our problems and relations
            with the rest of the world. Neither Europe nor we can afford these days to be provincial
            in our thinking.</p>
                    <p>I hope this may be of some help.</p>
                    <p>Sincerely,</p>

                    <p>The President said he thought he would tell the Chancellor that the U.S. has a 30
            billion dollar deficit but is ready to go through hell to stay with <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName>'s agreement;<note n="2" xml:id="d224fn2">Reference is to an agreement regarding troop deployment and related financial
              arrangements announced by the United States, United Kingdom, and Federal Republic of
              Germany on May 2. For text of the U.S. statement, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, May 22, 1967, pp. 788–789.</note> that if the <pb n="564" xml:id="pg_564" facs="0594"/>Germans do go through with an adjustment of their

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said that Kiesinger has four
            plans. One calls for the reduction of men in uniform and a cut of about 15,000 in
            civilians. He said that if the Chancellor says he has to make a troop reduction, the
            President will have to say what he indicated.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said there were two contingencies: Failure to
            get satisfactory execution of tri-lateral agreements; and failure to keep a satisfactory
            number of Germans in uniform.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary suggested that the President use this approach in talking with the
            Chancellor: 1. Count our blessings—that in the political and economic sphere, we are in
            good shape with the Germans; that we are doing a respectable job in foreign aid. 2. They
            have gotten away from <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>'s rigid attitude
            towards the East. 3. In the broadest sense, the U.S. and Germany have a lot of common
            policy. 4. He is on the rebound from talks with De Gaulle, so be prepared for that.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said it is well for everyone to remember that we are working against a
            pretty solid background—that the Germans are solid partners in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> compared with others. He said a thorough explanation of each other's
            problems would be a good way to start the discussions.</p>

                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">U.S.-Soviet Relations</hi>—The Secretary asked Brandt whether
            there was suspicion in Germany, arising out of U.S. contacts with the Soviets, that we
            would reach agreement with the Soviets at the expense of German interests. Brandt
            replied that, although there are recurring intimations of this nature in the press,
            there is no substantial body of informed opinion in Germany that has such a concern. The
            Secretary pointed out the poor state of relations existing between the U.S. and the
            Soviet Union, which is not conducive to reaching new agreements. It is the Soviets who
            have failed to ratify the Consular Convention between us, even though it has now been
            approved by the U.S. Senate. His impression is that the Soviets are dominated by the
            fear of China—by the prospect of an unfriendly nation of a billion people possessing
            nuclear weapons on their border. Indeed, in his judgment it is the position of China
            with respect to the Vietnamese war, which prevents the U.S. and Russians from bringing
            about an end to the war. The Secretary felt that we and the Soviets could reach an
            agreement to end the war without difficulty. The Secretary referred in this connection
            to certain evidence that both the Soviet people and the satellites are getting tired of
            the sacrifices they are making throughout the world, i.e., in Vietnam, the Middle East
            and in the under-developed world.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">2. German-Soviet Relations</hi>—Brandt reported that although the
            official Soviet attitude toward Germany, and the Soviet press, remained harsh and
            critical, he had received certain suggestions in recent months that the Soviets might be
            seeking an improvement. He considered that certain signals had been passed to German
            officials in Moscow and Geneva which could be so interpreted. He has discussed this
            matter with <pb n="566" xml:id="pg_566" facs="0596"/>Soviet Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName> in Bonn, however, there has been as yet no
            change in Soviet policy. He would continue his efforts, since Germany desired an
            improvement in relations with the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">3. German Policy Toward Eastern Europe</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>a. <hi rend="italic">Romania</hi>—Brandt commented very favorably on his recent visit
            to Bucharest.<note n="2" xml:id="d225fn2">August 4–8. For text of the communiqué issued
              at the conclusion of the Brandt visit, see Meissner, <hi rend="italic">Die deutsche
                Ostpolitik</hi>, pp. 218–220.</note> He had been warmly received, having had some
            nineteen hours of conversation with high officials including six with the Prime
            Minister. He had found the Romanians willing to act quite independently of the Soviets.
            They seemed anxious to give practical effect to their recent establishment of diplomatic
            relations with Germany, both in the cultural and economic fields. They proposed
            cooperative economic enterprises in third countries—citing Morocco as a possibility. No
            details as to such arrangements, however, had been worked out. In discussions with the
            Romanians on how to proceed with negotiations on East-West security matters, Brandt had
            found, however, a sharp difference in view with the Romanians. Whereas Germany preferred
            that any negotiations be between the Blocs, i.e. <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
            and the Warsaw Pact, the Romanians preferred that they be bilateral—looking toward the
            removal of the Blocs. Manescu said jokingly that “they did not propose to let the
            Germans put the Russians in control of them again.”</p>
                    <p>b. <hi rend="italic">Czechoslovakia</hi>—Brandt was also optimistic about the exchange
            of Trade Missions<note n="3" xml:id="d225fn3">For text of the August 3 German statement
              on these discussions, see ibid., p. 217.</note> recently negotiated between Germany
            and Czechoslovakia by his personal representative, Ambassador Bahr. Although this had
            not been extended to official diplomatic or consular relations, the Czechs understood
            that the German Trade Mission would look out for the interest of Germans in
            Czechoslovakia generally.</p>
                    <p>c. <hi rend="italic">Bulgaria</hi>—According to Brandt, Germany could also have
            diplomatic relations with Bulgaria, if it were willing to cancel certain Bulgarian
            indebtedness to Germany. In response to a query by the Secretary, Brandt advised that
            these arose from recent commercial transactions.</p>
                    <p>d. Eastern Germany—With respect to their relations with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, Brandt commented on the harsh and unyielding attitude displayed by
              <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> to the recent proposals made by the
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, looking to the establishment of contacts in
            various technical areas.</p>
                    <p>4. <hi rend="italic">
                            <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>-European Security Proposal</hi>—The Secretary made
            reference to a recent proposal made by the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> to the
            effect that the Four Powers, i.e., United Kingdom, United States, France and Germany,
            should together consider possible moves in the field of European Security. Brandt
            commented that British Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BG4">George
              Brown</persName> had asked him to speak to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> about this proposal. As far as he could see, however, <pb n="567" xml:id="pg_567" facs="0597"/>the proposal was largely procedural in nature. He was not
            clear as to what the mechanism created would deal with. His own concept was that the
            Germans might first feel out the East Germans, to see what possibilities existed, after
            which these could be taken up by the Four Powers. The Secretary commented that it was
            easy for us to accept the British proposal as a procedural step, however, he too is not
            clear as to what they really have in mind.</p>
                    <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Greece, Turkey and Canada</hi>—In discussing <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> problems, Brandt referred to a rumor that he had heard
            to the effect that Greece and Turkey were considering withdrawing from <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, and associating with some regional group—in Greece's
            case with <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>. The Secretary pointed out that
            Turkey's interest lay more with Iran and Pakistan, and that this association might prove
            profitable in dealing with the Arabs. In the course of the ensuing discussions,
            skepticism was expressed by both the Secretary and Brandt that Greece and Turkey would
            in fact take such a step. The Secretary explained the recent apparent inconsistencies in
            Canadian policy, in terms of Prime Minister Pearson's having been awarded the Pulitzer
            Peace Prize. Ever since that award, the Canadians have been looking for opportunities to
            be peacemakers. Difficulties arise in negotiations involving the Canadians, since no
            matter what the position of the U.S., they tend to take contrary or different views in
            order to demonstrate their independence of us.</p>
                    <p>6. <hi rend="italic">
                            <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Entry in the Common Market</hi>—Brandt referred to
            the strong public opinion in Germany supporting British entry into the Common Market. If
              <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> persisted in blocking British entry,
            a serious problem would arise before the end of the year in German-French relations.</p>
                    <p>7. <hi rend="italic">
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>
                        </hi>—The Secretary referred to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>'s
            recent visit to Canada and indicated our concern as to the implications of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>'s unusual behavior.<note n="4" xml:id="d225fn4">
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> visited Canada July 23–26. During a
              speech at Montreal City Hall on July 25, he repeated the rallying cry of
              French-Canadian separatists, “Vive Quebec libre.”</note> Did this mean that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> had become senile and was losing his grip?
            Brandt said that his impression from recent conversations on his <pb n="568" xml:id="pg_568" facs="0598"/>visit to Bonn was that he was not, and he cited several
            examples of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>'s mental acuity and firm
            grasp of the situation. In his judgment we would have to put up with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> for another two to three years.</p>
                    <p>8. <hi rend="italic">France and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        </hi>—Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> referred to recent evidence
            that we had heard that France was considering withdrawing from <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> in 1969. He suggested to Brandt the desirability of our discussing this
            with our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies in order to prepare them for such
            an eventuality, otherwise, French withdrawal might have a serious effect on the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. Brandt discounted the possibility of French
            withdrawal. He pointed out the assurances <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName> had given him during his recent visit to Bonn. Brandt did not react
            to the suggestions of concerted action. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName> pointed out the desirability of not taking any action since it
            might encourage the French withdrawal.</p>
                    <p>9. <hi rend="italic">German Reunification</hi>—The Secretary said he wanted to make it
            clear to Brandt that we would be glad at any time to consider or support any reasonable
            move looking toward German reunification. The difficulties that he had had in this
            respect with Schroeder during his period of Foreign Minister was only that he had
            insisted that the Western Four be in agreement as to how we proceed and that the Soviets
            accept a Western proposal to negotiate. In the absence of such prior agreement there was
            the danger that the U.S. would find itself alone as it did in 1961 and 1962.</p>
                    <p>10. <hi rend="italic">Soviet Troop Withdrawal</hi>—The Secretary advised Brandt that we
            see no evidence of Soviet willingness to engage in reciprocal troop withdrawals in
            central Europe. This is probably because the Soviets fear criticism that they had acted
            against the interests of the bloc, by making it possible for the U.S. to release troops
            for Vietnam. In fact, however, we have ample troops in Vietnam and in any event would
            not use troops so released. In recent years the U.S. has taken a different attitude on
            the question of troop withdrawals from that which we held earlier. Initially we were
            concerned with the obvious disparity between U.S. withdrawals to America and Soviet
            withdrawals to the Soviet Union, however, changing circumstances in Eastern Europe
            perhaps have reduced the disparity.</p>
                    <p>11. <hi rend="italic">Political Consultation Among the Six</hi>—In responding to what
            had been decided at the recent Summit meeting in Rome concerning political consultation
            among the Six, Brandt said that the agreement had been only to consider the feasibility
            of such discussions—not to conduct such discussions themselves. He was very skeptical
            about the ability to have discussions about the security threat to Europe as provided
            for under the Treaty of Rome.</p>

                    <p>After expressing regrets for having kept everyone waiting so long,<note n="2" xml:id="d226fn2">The President and Chancellor met privately at noon. A memorandum of
              conversation covering the initial meeting is in <ref target="frus1964-68v13#d263">
                                <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1964–1968, vol. XIII, Document
              263</ref>.</note> the President said that the Chancellor and he had had a good
            exchange of views. He said that they had talked about our mutual problems and touched on
            all the important issues which would be taken up in detail during the latter part of the
            visit. The President said that he had explained to the Chancellor his feeling that our
            common bond, our unity, <pb n="570" xml:id="pg_570" facs="0600"/>our standing
            shoulder-to-shoulder is unchanged. The President explained that he and the Chancellor
            were in complete agreement that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> must be kept
            sturdy to defend Germany and Europe. He said that complete understanding had been
            reached on this point.</p>
                    <p>The President said that on the non-proliferation treaty he had asked the Chancellor to
            review with the Secretary of State and other officials all details of that project. He
            said he had made it abundantly clear to the Chancellor, as he had to his predecessor,
            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>, that we would not take any
            decisions affecting the welfare of Germany without first having had the most candid
            consultations.</p>
                    <p>The President reported that on the question of the trilateral talks and troop strength,
            the Chancellor had told him it would not be necessary to reduce the German strength at
            all; in any event it would in his view not be more than a reduction of some 15,000. The
            President said he had made it clear we didn't think there should be any reduction. He
            referred to gallant efforts on our part to avoid any reductions of U.S. troop strength.
            He stated that if the German people felt it was essential to make reductions in the
            German military establishment, it would cause us a serious problem here, a problem over
            which he might not be able to prevail. He said the decision of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> on this is one that would be made for both nations. He
            said we hoped it would not be necessary for us to make reductions. He said we will try
            to avoid them.</p>
                    <p>The President said that as far as the Chancellor and he were concerned, they had the
            same objectives: maintain our strength, work to lessen tensions, remain loyal and true
            to one another, and work for a united Germany and Europe.</p>
                    <p>The President said he and the Chancellor had exchanged views on <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>. He mentioned that the Chancellor and he had
            talked about bridge building. He said he had given him our views on Viet-Nam and the
            Middle East. He told him how earnestly we were working to solve that problem. He said we
            were living in very serious times and were anxious to meet our problems without
            endangering our security.</p>
                    <p>The President returned, at the conclusion of his remarks, to the possibility of cutting
            troop strength. He reiterated the view that we should not reduce our troops, but he
            pointed to the $30 billion deficit we had and his need for getting a tax bill through
            the Congress. He said if we did not get such a tax bill, we would face serious problems.
            He might have to make cuts even where he didn't want to.</p>
                    <p>Chancellor Kiesinger expressed full agreement with the President's remarks. He said his
            colleague, Minister of Defense Schroeder, had done great damage with the report that
            German troop strength would be cut by 60,000. Kiesinger said there had been no such
            Cabinet decision; there had been merely cuts from projections for spending. The
            Chancellor said he had made it clear the Germans would increase their spending. He
            referred <pb n="571" xml:id="pg_571" facs="0601"/>to the proposal for medium-term
            financing, a new kind of planning for the Germans, to give them some idea where they
            were going. He said he had learned that some of the planning in the Ministry of Defense
            had been highly unrealistic. He referred in this connection to a conversation he had had
            with General De Maziere, who had told former Defense Minister <persName corresp="#p_HKU1">Von Hassel</persName> to come down to earth. Two weeks before
              <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s fall, <persName corresp="#p_HKU1">Von Hassel</persName> finally accepted the General's recommendation.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor said he was personally convinced that they could maintain their present
            troop strength but that if the decision was to cut, it would under no circumstances be
            more than between 15,000 and 19,000. He repeated, no final decision had been reached. He
            stated a final decision would be made only after consultations with us. He also assured
            the President that any of the four plans recommended for the absorption of the reduced
            projections would not weaken the German military establishment.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor said he wanted to use this occasion to draw the President's attention to
            his Government's declaration of last December to the effect that the Germans would
            increase their spending for aid. He said the Germans had done so. He pointed to this
            sector of the German budg-et in which there had been no cut. He said German aid would
            increase in 1968 by 26%, in 1969 by 10% and in 1970 by 6%.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor said he had told the President that according to a public poll taken in
            Germany this year, to the question, “Do you think close cooperation with the United
            States is necessary?”, the response had been 42% affirmative in January, 47% in
            February, 69% in May, and 71% in June.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor said he wanted to say a word about <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName>. He said he had decided to provoke the General and probe his real
            feeling about the United States. Kiesinger said he had told the General that the Germans
            regarded <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and an integrated military system as
            indispensable and that the Alliance had to be strengthened. He warned <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> that remarks about the U.S. could damage
            Franco-German relations. Kiesinger said it was interesting that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> had stated publicly and even more strongly
            privately that French policy was not directed against the U.S.; that he wanted to
            preserve French friendship for the U.S.; that he wanted to preserve the Alliance until
            relations with the East were completely changed; and that he had no objections to the
            maintenance of U.S. troops in Europe. Privately <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName> had told Kiesinger that the presence of U.S. troops was even
            desirable.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor said up to a point the Germans could win some ground from <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>. The General had been much more stubborn about
            U.K. entry into the Common Market, but the Germans continued to show their support for
            the British. At the same time they had told Harold Wilson they couldn't act as a
            bulldozer.</p>
                    <pb n="572" xml:id="pg_572" facs="0602"/>
                    <p>The Chancellor said that he and <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> agreed
            that they disagreed on most points. The Germans hope, according to Kiesinger, in the
            long run to accomplish one big task, to overcome the existing antagonism and to restore
            normal conditions in Europe. He said there was a natural destiny which linked France and
            Germany.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor turned to German efforts in Eastern Europe. He mentioned Foreign
            Minister Brandt's trip to Romania and the exchanging of trade missions with the Czechs.
            He said he had told the Czechs that the Munich Agreement was no longer valid; that the
            Germans no longer wanted to base their relations with Czechoslovakia on that treaty.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor, in summing up, referred to reports in some U.S. papers alleging that a
            reduction of 60,000 men in the German Army had some connection with a new German policy,
            some new form of cooperation with France, or some new Rapallo. He said this was “sheer
            nonsense, sheer nonsense”. He said the Germans were determined to continue their close
            relations with the U.S., adapted to modern requirements. He said he knew that European
            security could not be assured without U.S. support. He said the Germans would do what
            they could to make their contribution to assuring that security.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor asked the President to trust him and not to listen to rumor makers. He
            said with great emphasis: “As long as I am the Chief of the German Government, you can
            depend on us going along that way… . ; we will be honest; we will make sure of your
            friendship by being your friend.”</p>
                    <p>The President said it was very heartening to all around the table to hear the
            Chancellor's remarks. He regarded this a good omen for this visit. He said what had
            distressed all of us were rumors and reports before decisions had been made. He said he
            had been very glad to have the Ambassador come to him and inform him of the facts. The
            President said none of us should take action without full consultations with <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. He said he was the last to want to dismantle <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. This is why we had to help the British and the Germans
            earlier to keep them from starting the unravelling process. The President said he didn't
            want to mislead the Chancellor. He said he did not know whether he had the strength to
            keep <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> from forcing U.S. troop reductions
            if the Germans made reductions in their military establishment. The American people
            would not be able to understand why we should maintain our troop strength in Germany if
            the Germans themselves felt able to cut their own troops. The President concluded he
            hoped and prayed that no cuts would be made.</p>

                    <p>Chancellor Kiesinger thanked the United States participants for coming and making their
            time available to this meeting. Responding to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>'s inquiry, he said that in his meeting with the President they did
            not get into details on any subject. They had had a general tour d'horizon. Perhaps they
            would discuss details tomorrow. He had learned some interesting things. He had reported
            to the President on his talks with General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName> in July. They then talked about East-West problems and European
            problems. On the nonproliferation treaty they just mentioned the subject without any
            detailed discussion. Foreign Minister Brandt added that he and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> in their discussions had covered the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> problem.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said that in his talks about the
            nonproliferation treaty with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> he had
            expressed the opinion that a number of <pb n="574" xml:id="pg_574" facs="0604"/>countries would feel that “forever” was a long time and that the duration of the
            treaty would no doubt be raised. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had not
            indicated that a duration clause would be entirely unacceptable, but the Secretary
            thought the shorter the duration period, the more difficult it would be with the
            Soviets. We should now see how things develop in Geneva. After all, tabling the draft
            treaty is not the end of the process, but really the beginning. One hundred countries
            will have their own views. In his last talks with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> the Secretary had found him not so much concerned with the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> as with India. He added that we still have no final word
            from the Soviets as to whether they would be prepared to table the draft treaty or on
            what day. Perhaps it would be the end of this week or next week. The Secretary then
            asked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName> to present the United
            States views on the liquidity problem.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName> said that, as he had discussed
            with Foreign Minister Brandt, the United States and the Federal Republic were together
            embarked on an ambitious but necessary venture in the financial field—to create within
            the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> new arrangements to add liquidity to the world
            monetary system, which would be needed when the United States deficits came to an end
            and annual additions of gold to the world monetary system were found to be inadequate.
            Neither national currencies nor gold could in the future be a reliable source for
            accretions to liquidity. If this joint venture ends in failure, it could usher in a
            period of restrictionist practices by Central Banks, the adoption of beggar-thy-neighbor
            policies and the posing of a constant threat of financial crises such as we had had in
            the 30's. Dr. Otmar Emminger, Director of the German Bundesbank, had been the leader of
            a remarkable group of monetary technicians who after a period of two years of intensive
            work had completed the outline of a plan for establishing a new system to create
            additional liquidity which will be considered at the September meeting of the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> in Rio de Janeiro. During the past spring and summer the
            momentum behind this work had been retarded by the unwillingness of the French to agree
            to the general framework for a new plan which all of the other major countries want to
            establish. At the meeting of Financial Ministers in London on July 17, at which Minister
              <persName corresp="#p_SK6">Schiller</persName> and Dr. Emminger represented
            Germany, agreement was very nearly reached on the two issues of: (1) voting and (2)
            providing for the new liquidity in a form which would make it acceptable as reserves to
            the Central Banks. In fact, with a little give and take, agreement would have been
            reached at the July 17 meeting if it had not been for the French. The French Finance
            Minister, M. <persName corresp="#p_DM4">Debre</persName>, who Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName> thought was personally inclined to go along,
            simply did not have the authority. Now there will be another meeting in London on August
            26 to resolve these two issues but the French problem remained. The others were anxious
            to go ahead. He knew there was some reluctance on the part of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> to leave the French, but in his view if all <pb n="575" xml:id="pg_575" facs="0605"/>the rest were determined to go ahead this would be the
            best way to bring the French along.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> asked if Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName> had heard from M. <persName corresp="#p_DM4">Debre</persName> since their July 17 meeting in London.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName> replied he had not. M.
              <persName corresp="#p_DM4">Debre</persName> thought it would be in the interest of the
            world to get this matter resolved but he had no authority to do anything about it. He
            emphasized that the United States could agree to the compromise on the nature of the new
            reserve asset worked out by the Italians and the Germans but that the French wanted it
            all their own way. The United States had gone at least 60 per cent of the distance to
            meet European views.</p>
                    <p>Chancellor Kiesinger said he was not an expert on this matter but knew that President
              <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> was anxious for a solution. He had had
            the impression from Minister <persName corresp="#p_SK6">Schiller</persName>'s reports
            that good progress was being made on the matter.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName> replied the good progress was
            among the other participants with France remaining aside. Now the problem was to close
            the gap between the others and France. The United States had gone as far as it could
            down the road of concessions. Either of the two compromise proposals made by Italy and
            by Emminger/<persName corresp="#p_SK6">Schiller</persName> could be acceptable to the
            United States. But if further concessions were made only a meaningless gesture would
            result. The United States had gone very far to give General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DM4">Debre</persName> a political
            “out”.</p>
                    <p>Chancellor Kiesinger said he believed progress had been made at the Munich Conference
            of the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> Ministers.</p>
                    <p>Minister Brandt suggested the matter be further explored through other contacts between
            the two governments before their departure on Saturday.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> inquired if the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> and the proposed plan provided for individual vetoes.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName> replied this was not the case.
            However, adoption of the 85 per cent voting qualification would provide the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> countries, acting together, the possibility of a
            veto.</p>
                    <p>Chancellor Kiesinger said he believed <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>
            had taken a softer stand on this matter during their second meeting. His government
            could prepare the climate perhaps by talking to Debre before the London meeting. He
            would discuss the matter with Minister <persName corresp="#p_SK6">Schiller</persName>
            upon his return to Germany and see what could be done.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName> added the technicians had
            exhausted their possibilities. The matter now called for a political decision.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> then asked the Chancellor's
            opinion on rumors that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> might withdraw
            from the Atlantic Alliance, i.e. the North Atlantic <pb n="576" xml:id="pg_576" facs="0606"/>Treaty. His reference to “blocs” in his last press conference may have
            pointed in that direction. He was interested in two questions:</p>
                    <p>a) Was it likely that he would withdraw?</p>
                    <p>b) If he did, how could the others best prepare for it?</p>
                    <p>Preparation would soften the shock the news would bring to many. Nobody, for example,
            would be very shocked to learn today that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName> may want to withdraw from <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>.
            But if the news of a French withdrawal from the North Atlantic Treaty came at an
            inopportune time, and without preparation, it could have serious effects on the
            Alliance.</p>
                    <p>Chancellor Kiesinger replied he concluded from <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName>'s statement during their meeting in July that he wanted to preserve
            the Western Alliance at least until such time as the relationship with the East had
            “completely changed”, that he did not intend to pull out of the NAT in 1969, as it was
            not conceivable that a “complete change” could come about so soon. He would try,
            however, to find out more on the matter in future talks.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> asked if the Chancellor thought it
            was all right then to proceed on the assumption that the French would remain? Maybe by
            raising the issue he would only be putting ideas in <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName>'s head.</p>
                    <p>Chancellor Kiesinger assured the Secretary nobody could put ideas in <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>'s head. He, for his part, felt satisfied that
            the phrasing “complete change” pointed to France remaining after 1969.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> inquired if the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> had started to think about the June 1968 expiration of
            the trilateral agreement and if the Chancellor though it might be a good idea to have an
            arrangement of a more extended nature rather than the previous one-year agreement. Would
            he prefer to start bilateral talks first or would he like to go into trilateral talks
            again?</p>
                    <p>Chancellor Kiesinger replied the British Ambassador had taken up this subject with him
            about two weeks ago. He had spoken of a medium or long-term arrangement. He (Kiesinger)
            could not make a full statement on this at this time. He was happy this matter was not
            on the agenda during this visit (said jokingly).</p>
                    <p>Minister Brandt added that before leaving for the United States yesterday he had asked
            that one man from each side explore the possibility of a suggested (by the British)
            5-year agreement. He thought it advisable to have bilateral discussions first. Also, the
            last trilateral approach had been criticized by other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> partners.</p>
                    <p>Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName> seconded the idea of bilateral talks to be held
            first and cited other reasons for it.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> asked the Chancellor how he saw
            the timing of future German decisions to implement recent adjustments in military <pb n="577" xml:id="pg_577" facs="0607"/>budget in relationship to the December defense
            review to be conducted in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>?</p>
                    <p>Chancellor Kiesinger answered that a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
            questionnaire on this matter had to be filled out by October 6. They couldn't answer all
            the questions by that time but he felt certain that a clear picture could be presented
            by December.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> suggested the Chancellor
            might want to explore a method similar to the United States rotational plan, namely, to
            offset cuts in his active forces by strengthening his reserves, which now were rather
            weak. In any adjustment it was important to not give the Soviets the impression that it
            would result in a weakening of the Allied strength, and it must, indeed, not be weakened
            in fighting power.</p>
                    <p>He was anxious to meet with Minister Schroeder to discuss this matter. He was at the
            Chancellor's disposal to answer any questions he might have.</p>
                    <p>Chancellor Kiesinger replied he basically agreed with <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s comment on the reserves and on maintaining fighting power. As a
            first-line power near the border the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> was eager to
            have as strong a deterrent as possible. Some people were worried that in an emergency
            rotational forces could not be redeployed quickly enough. This matter should be reviewed
            again in more detail.</p>
                    <p>Minister Brandt added that some understanding would have to be found in <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> about the counting of reserves as a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> contribution. <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss>
            considers “forces in being” as the only acceptable contribution, but this was before the
            introduction of the new concept of political warning time which resulted from the
            trilateral talks. But even if there were only 3 to 6 days of warning, Germany could
            mobilize its reserves. The political-warning theory, which the Germans had been more
            reluctant to embrace than others (laughter) would have to be reviewed again also.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> agreed with the German
            Foreign Minister. He said the opinions of the United States, the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> on warning time should be
            compared in a study.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> added that if the Soviets were to
            make proportionate troop redeployments, this would help in giving the West additional
            warning time.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said an inspection system
            also would result in additional warning time.</p>
                    <p>He was aware also of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>'s strong interest in
            sharing more fully in nuclear planning, in knowing more about the nuclear hardware on
            their soil, and in having a voice in the decision of triggering or not triggering an
            atomic strike. The United States was anxious to cooperate on these matters and would
            provide any and all information. The <gloss target="#t_NPG1">NPG</gloss> had <pb n="578" xml:id="pg_578" facs="0608"/>been created for this purpose, but if desired, bilateral
            talks could be held first.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> suggested the Chancellor might
            want to visit Omaha at some time. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> offered to take him there personally.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor said that might be a good idea but did not commit himself one way or the
            other.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> added the Chancellor might find
            Omaha quite appalling. It was another world that he hoped would never be heard from in
            the future. Nevertheless, it would be quite interesting to come to know it in the
            context of the common alliance.</p>
                    <p>Chancellor Kiesinger said the important thing in American-German and in Atlantic
            relations was to create a climate of trust. The people wanted to know where they stood.
            It would be very beneficial if some of the groundless rumors could be kept out of the
            papers. The news media were spreading the impression that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> was slowly but surely disintegrating. Many people were influenced by
            this in their judgments and willingness to support the alliance.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> pointed to the need for <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> to take a greater interest and play a greater role in
            areas of the world beyond the immediate borders of the defensive alliance. He cited the
            Middle East as an example.</p>
                    <p>Chancellor Kiesinger interjected this was bringing up the question whether <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> should be a political institution or just a defensive
            military organization.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said he had been surprised to
            learn during a visit to <gloss target="#t_SACLANT1">SACLANT</gloss> headquarters last
            year that the people there drew a line at a certain parallel as limiting their field of
            naval planning. They were not interested in anything below a certain latitude. He could
            not conceive how the area south of that line in the Atlantic could not be of interest to
            the security of the Atlantic Ocean. Similarly he could not see how one could really cope
            with the problem of European security without considering the Middle East, for
            example.</p>
                    <p>Chancellor Kiesinger said <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> should at least study
            those matters and have a position on them.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> thanked the Chancellor for the
            generous amount of time he had allotted for this discussion.</p>
                    <p>The meeting then broke up at 5:27 p.m.</p>

                    <p>After an exchange of pleasantries the talk turned to the question of possible troop
            reductions:</p>
                    <p>The President expressed his disenchantment with an article in the Washington Post of
            the same morning.<note n="2" xml:id="d228fn2">“<gloss target="#t_LBJ1">LBJ</gloss> Is
              Cool to Cut in German Troops,” by Chalmers Roberts.</note> He said it was important to
            make this matter clear to the Press so that there would be no further distortions. He
            suggested the Chancellor may want to quote to the Press directly from his minutes of
            their meeting on the previous day.<note n="3" xml:id="d228fn3">See <ref target="#d226fn2">footnote 2, Document 226</ref>.</note> The Chancellor might want
            to say:</p>
                    <p>No decision had been made;</p>
                    <p>In his judgment a cutback was not now necessary;</p>
                    <p>A decision on such a matter would only be taken after discussing the matter with his
            cabinet, the United States and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>He did not think it would even be good to talk about any figures on maximum cutbacks,
            like 15,000 or 19,000.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor said he had even gone beyond that. He had stated that even the <gloss target="#t_MOD1">MOD</gloss> and his generals were convinced that any needed cut would
            not have to exceed 15,000 or so.</p>
                    <p>The President replied it was not good to quote any specific figures. If the Chancellor
            would quote 15,000, for example, it was almost certain to be expected that other
            countries would take that figure as a basis for proportionate cuts. The British might
            say, they would then have to cut back 5,000, the Belgians 3,500, the US 35,000 etc.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor stated he did not want to go back to Germany and have to say: President
              <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> was adamant on this point, and he had
            to give in.</p>
                    <pb n="580" xml:id="pg_580" facs="0610"/>
                    <p>He would say that he personally was not convinced of the need of any cuts at this time.
            However, should that need arise the cuts would not be substantial.</p>
                    <p>The President said it was better to say “no substantial cuts” than to quote any
            figures. He did not want to use this as an excuse, but his experts had advised him that
            Congress may not be willing to allocate the money for the support of US troops in Europe
            if the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> made any cuts. Such news would be
            ill-received on the Hill.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor said he would stick to the language of “no substantial cuts”.</p>
                    <p>The President inquired if an upgrading of the reserves may be a solution to the
            problem.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor pointed to some of the difficulties this would raise. There was a
            shortage of non-commissioned officers and officers. Relations between the three levels
            of the service (officers, non-coms, enlisted) were “not sound”. In a crisis
            non-commissioned officers may have to be supplemented by enlisted men functioning as
              <gloss target="#t_NCO1">NCO</gloss>s. Rotation of reserves may aggravate that
            situation. Reserves also would have to be provided with periodic training exercises.
            There might be some merit to the reserve proposal, however, and he would have it
            examined.</p>
                    <p>The President suggested a sentence in the joint statement on their meeting dealing with
            Franco-German cooperation might be formulated differently.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor, in agreeing to the change, spoke again of his intention to play a
            “harmonizing role” in US-French relations.</p>
                    <p>The President encouraged the Chancellor to be a bridge-builder between the two
            countries. The Chancellor may want to show <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName> notes of the transcript of their Washington meetings. The Chancellor
            was welcome to relay to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> the comments of
            the President on <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> as stated in these
            meetings. He was anxious to avoid all quarreling among friends and allies. He was
            convinced, as he had stated before, that in times of real danger <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> would be on our side.</p>
                    <p>The President then encouraged the Chancellor to take a little walk through the grounds.
            On the way out he showed him the folder with the “hot-line” transcripts<note n="4" xml:id="d228fn4">The notebook of Hotline messages is in the Johnson Library, National
              Security File, Head of State Correspondence, <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>,
              Washington-Moscow “Hot Line” Exchange.</note> and pointed to one message in particular
            which the Chancellor read with interest.</p>
                    <p>The President and the Chancellor then talked privately without interpreters in the Rose
            Garden and while walking. (At one point Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt W.

            minutes.)</p>

                    <p>2654. Subject: The current calm in US-German relations.</p>
                    <p>1. Contrasted with the situation six months ago, German-American relations are
            presently characterized by a pervading calm—an absence of controversial issues. Offset
            and related troop rotation problems have, at least pending the German decision on
            reduction of forces, been resolved. The <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>—while still
            not a happy prospect for the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>—has been recast to meet
            the most acute <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> objections and there are now others
            who are willing to take the lead in seeking further gains. The emotional resentment
            against us is substantially reduced. The Kennedy Round and the international liquidity
            problem have both been settled to our mutual satisfaction. There is no acute concern
            over US investment—a recent large US purchase of a German firm went unnoticed. The
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> appears satisfied that consultation between us is
            adequate. The initial delay in a meeting between the President and Chancellor was in
            itself a source of instability. One could now say that, with the completion of their
            recent highly successful meeting, a new period in German-American relations—one long in
            the making—began.</p>
                    <p>2. The principal characteristic of the present period is a clearer separation—but not
            necessarily divergence—of German policy from our own. The Federal Govt knows that the
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> remains dependent on the US for defense. There is,
            however, no present military pressure from the East, and the Germans are therefore in a
            position to concentrate more of their attention on problems where the US role is less
            important. For the German Govt and people, the overriding present concern is their
            economic recession and budgetary squeeze, a field outside the direct influence of the
            US. During the period of their postwar recovery the Germans made massive contributions
            to every sort of international endeavor and charity—in order to gain acceptance by the
            community of nations. Now, deeply alarmed by their first real post-war economic
            turndown, they are looking out for themselves.</p>
                    <p>3. In second place among their concerns stands the German problem—or more precisely
            stated, the development of a more hopeful relationship with the Communist countries and
            with East Germany. The critical importance of the US in an eventual European settlement
            is accepted by the Germans, and they wish to work with us toward this goal. <pb n="582" xml:id="pg_582" facs="0612"/>In their present efforts in Eastern Europe, however, they
            appear to have concluded that too close an association with the US can be more of a
            handicap than a help. They look to the French—their closest European associate—as being
            a more natural and effective partner in this particular enterprise.</p>
                    <p>4. The problem of Western security, particularly the German contribution thereto,
            probably ranks third in the list of current German concerns; and here the position of
            the US remains of paramount importance. It is indicative that our closest bilateral
            consultation is presently in this area.</p>
                    <p>5. It has no doubt been the Chancellor's objective to remove some of the emotion from
            German relations—both with France and the US. He has succeeded, in part at least, by
            insisting that German policy be friendly toward, but independent of, both. He does not
            hesitate to disassociate himself from French <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
            policy—and US Viet Nam policy. As the Chancellor told the Press Club,<note n="2" xml:id="d229fn2">August 16. For extracts of the significant portions, see Meissner,
                <hi rend="italic">Die deutsche Ostpolitik</hi>, pp. 225–227.</note> the German Govt
            will no longer look to the US to solve all of its problems. Indeed, it has come to
            realize that we cannot in all cases do so, even if we wanted to. The result, I believe,
            will be less closeness in our relations but also, in the long run, less potential
            tension and recriminations.</p>
                    <p>6. There are, nonetheless, possible areas of difficulty in the future. I would list the
            main ones as follows:</p>
                    <p>A. A new European order—We have in the past encouraged the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> to seek better relations with the Soviets and Eastern Europe, and a more
            fruitful contact with East Germany. In doing so, we have defined no limits as to how far
            we think they could safely go without endangering Western security. We showed signs of
            unease when Kiesinger hinted that a reunited Germany might be neutral—and when Brandt
            suggested that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> might disappear. But we have not—I
            think wisely—tried to say now what would or would not be acceptable to the US in the way
            of a European settlement. For their part the German leaders do not appear to have
            thought very clearly of the limits they would set for themselves. On the other hand,
            they show almost an eagerness for contacts—to wit, Brandt's recent discussion with
            Soviet Amb <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName> (Bonn 2555)<note n="3" xml:id="d229fn3">Dated September 7. (Department of State, Central Files, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 38–6)</note>—and Kiesinger's exchange of letters with
            East German Chairman <persName corresp="#p_SW6">Stoph</persName>. Should the East
            show some readiness for movement and the Germans respond, I believe misunderstanding
            might arise between us as to how far the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> can and
            should go without doing harm to the interests of the US and of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. This is something we must discuss with the Germans.</p>
                    <pb n="583" xml:id="pg_583" facs="0613"/>
                    <p>B. Security—The planned rotation of some 35,000 US troops has caused no serious
            disquiet in Germany. A more extensive reduction in the US presence would still bring
            with it, however, a strain in our relations and a further decrease in US influence in
            Germany. On the German side, some troop reduction seems inevitable, although not more
            than 19,000 troops for the present, and this probably over three years. Even, this,
            however, can cause strain on our side—and release presures for further US rotations or
            withdrawals. We must work closely with the Germans to minimize both their reduction and
            its impact in the US. The development of an American <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
            system could also cause severe problems in our relations, probably more intense than
            with other less exposed European countries—although the difference would be only one of
            degree. A potential danger also lies in the possibility of our not reaching the same
            conclusions with respect to the carrying into the production phase our joint V/STOL and
            main battle tank development projects.</p>
                    <p>C. The US-Soviet relationship—During the recent past, the main problem for them which
            the Germans have viewed as resulting from US-Soviet relations has been the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>. As indicated earlier, this issue has now largely been
            relieved of its emotional content. This same reaction can occur again, however, if we
            are able to reach further agreements with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
            affecting Germany or Europe—without some progress, or visible effort on our part to
            achieve progress, on the German question. We should, therefore, clearly indicate to the
            Germans our willingness to consider any reasonable step they can propose which might
            result in some movement of the German question.</p>
                    <p>D. American investment—Further concentration of US investment in German industry,
            particularly in petroleum, will entail problems which could eventually reach serious
            proportions. We must consult closely with our companies on this possibility, pointing
            out the likely consequences of their actions.</p>
                    <p>7. Conclusion. It seems to me that we should also take advantage of the present absence
            of divisive issues in our relations with Germans in the following general ways:</p>
                    <p>A. We should seek to expand the constructive initiatives which have been taken to
            enlarge cooperation in mutually beneficial projects between our countries. For example,
            exchanges in the social environmental field initiated by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_USL1">Udall</persName>'s visit—and more recently in transportation—should
            be pursued. Cooperation in research and co-production in advanced fields such as space
            technology should be expanded.</p>
                    <p>B. Consultation at all levels should be frequent and comprehensive, concentrating in
            particular on the fields of most likely future difficulties—in an effort to avoid
            troubles before they arise. Direct exchanges <pb n="584" xml:id="pg_584" facs="0614"/>between the President and Chancellor, with emphasis on the broad world outlook, should
            be encouraged.</p>

                    <p>2416. Subj: Meeting with Brandt. I had a conversation with <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> Brandt today, on the eve of his departure for what he hopes will be a
            three week vacation on the Tegern See. The following subjects were discussed:</p>
                    <p>1. Four-Power <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>'s meeting. Brandt gave me the
            background of his own discussions and thinking with respect to a Four-Power <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>s meeting on European security, as proposed by the
            US, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and German policy planners. He had talked with
            British FonSec <persName corresp="#p_BG4">Brown</persName> on this subject while they
            were both in Norway in early July; however, they had been limited in what they could say
            by the fact that the conversation was over the telephone. <persName corresp="#p_BG4">Brown</persName> had to go back to London because of the Chinese crisis<note n="2" xml:id="d230fn2">Communist-inspired rioting in Hong Kong began on May 6, and attacks
              on British diplomats in China commenced on May 15. Terrorist bombings followed as the
              crisis escalated. The British Embassy in Beijing was sacked by the Red Guards on
              August 22.</note> before he could meet with him personally. <persName corresp="#p_BG4">Brown</persName> had offered to contact <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName>
            with respect to the meeting; however, he doubted the advisability of meeting in New York
            during the General Assembly because of the publicity that would probably be aroused.
            Brandt now thinks the best time and place for a meeting would be during the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> meeting in December, perhaps at the regular Four-Power
            dinner preceding the main meeting. In the meantime, the respective experts in each
            country can be looking into the problem further.</p>
                    <p>As regards substance, Brandt “does not know whether this is just the right time for a
            move on the German question and European security.” It might be wise, however, to have
            some proposals ready when such a time comes. It would be good for the Soviets to know
            that the three <pb n="585" xml:id="pg_585" facs="0615"/>Western Powers are thinking
            about the problem. In the meantime the Germans will continue probing the East Germans to
            see if there is any opportunity for progress. In response to my query, Brandt said that
            no top-level German consideration had yet been given to the possibility for a meeting
            between the Chancellor and <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
                        <gloss target="#t_MinPres1">MinPres</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SW6">Stoph</persName>.</p>
                    <p>In Brandt's view the Soviets would probably not be willing at this time to help create
            a “Four-Power umbrella” for discussions between the East and West Germans. His own
            concept of that might be put forward by the Western Allies is a “small package” at best,
            nothing like the “large packages” involving German reunification which have been put
            forward in the past. If, for example, a proposal could be made for the withdrawal of
            50,000 Soviet troops—and accepted—it would at least help provide us additional warning
            time in the event of a crisis. Brandt emphasized that he did not believe we should aim
            at something that would engender a lot of publicity.</p>
                    <p>2. Franco-German study of European defense in the 70's. Brandt's description of German
            thinking on how to proceed with the proposed Franco-German study corresponded to that of
            Carstens in my discussion with him on Sept 1 (see Embtel 2404).<note n="3" xml:id="d230fn3">Dated September 2. (Department of State, Central Files, DEF 6–12
              US)</note> The French had proposed at one time that both sides appoint high-level
            military personage to head their respective missions, suggesting for their part Gen de
            Brebisson. This created a problem for the Germans since they had no one comparable.
            Present German thinking is that there should be one group on each side headed by a
            political representative—in their case a <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> man.
            He did not indicate whom he had in mind. He has recently heard that the French have
            changed their view and are now preparing to send someone from the Quai d'Orsay. I asked
            Brandt about the significance of the memorandum “Concepts of a Future European Security
            Agreement” prepared by the French unofficial Center for Strategic Studies, which had
            been released by the German Federal press agency (Bonn A–296).<note n="4" xml:id="d230fn4">Dated August 28. (Ibid., DEF 1 <gloss target="#t_EUR1">EUR</gloss>)</note> He replied that he was aware that the document had been widely
            distributed; however, he disclaimed that the Germans would accept its premises as a
            basis for the study.</p>
                    <p>3. <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>. I asked Brandt his views with respect to the
            prospects for an <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>. What was the status of their
            proposal that they become permanent members of the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>
            board? Brandt said that this was not yet clear; however, this was only one possible
            solution to the problem of mandatory acceptance of amendments under <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>. Since several other nations have indicated unwillingness
            to accept such a provision, the pressure seems to be off the Germans on this point. He
            understood that it would take some time before it could be determined whether or not an
              <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> is <pb n="586" xml:id="pg_586" facs="0616"/>possible. In the meantime Germany would be happy to meet with <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> countries on the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>, assuming France will join. He did not know what the French attitude was;
            however, he would expect that they would prefer to wait until after it had been
            determined whether or not the treaty would be signed. In the meantime, the initiative in
            the matter lay with the Belgians.</p>
                    <p>4. Letter from Mayor Albertz. I referred to the letter dated August 24 from Mayor
            Albertz of Berlin,<note n="5" xml:id="d230fn5">Not found.</note> advising of the
            creation of a viability commission for Berlin on which the Berlin representative would
            be Ber-thold Beitz—and requesting Allied participation. I referred Brandt to our
            previous conversation on this subject (Embtel 15393).<note n="6" xml:id="d230fn6">Dated
              June 29. (Department of State, Central Files, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 15–1
                <gloss target="#t_GER1">GER</gloss>)</note> Although we did not have a final US Govt
            or Allied position, my own thinking was still as we had discussed at that time. This
            should be a Berlin responsibility, to which we and the other Allies would perhaps be
            willing to lend experts and provide liaison officers. We would also be willing to
            discuss the work of the commission as it progressed, and receive its final
            recommendations. I did not believe, however, that we should accept formal representation
            on the commission. Brandt agreed that this was his concept.</p>
                    <p>I emphasized the potentially serious damage to Berlin's reputation—even its
            economy—which could result from the present student unrest. So far, however, it had not
            reached such proportions as to require the intervention of the Allies. It was a problem
            that could best be resolved by the city itself.</p>
                    <p>8. Bundesrat Presidency. I said that I was looking forward to a new relationship with
            the Governing Mayor in his capacity, beginning in November, as President of the
            Bundesrat (Bonn 2401).<note n="7" xml:id="d230fn7">Dated September 1. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 15–2 <gloss target="#t_GER1">GER</gloss>)</note>
            Without specifically mentioning Berlin voting rights, I said that we were sure he would
            keep the distinctions in his function as Governing Mayor and as Bundesrat President
            fully in mind.</p>

            Kiesinger. Following the briefing of Chancellor Kiesinger yesterday morning [less than 1

            reported separately,<note n="2" xml:id="d231fn2">Telegram 3237 from Bonn, September 22.
              (Ibid., DEF 12–1 <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">CHICOM</gloss>)</note> the Chancellor took
            me aside for a talk. We were alone.</p>
                    <p>1. German-US relations—I went over with the Chancellor my own concept of the current
            state of German-American relations as I had reported to the Dept in Embtel 2654.<note n="3" xml:id="d231fn3">
                            <ref target="#d229">Document 229</ref>.</note> In doing so I paid particular tribute
            to his personal success in Washington and the high degree of rapport he had reached with
            the President. We should take advantage of the present state of calm and stability in
            our relations to go forward with joint endeavors. If any question should ever arise
            which he felt might be a potential source of discord between us, I hoped he would call
            it to my attention or write a letter to the President. I mentioned the question of our
              <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment (referring to Sec <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s speech of Sept 18<note n="4" xml:id="d231fn4">For text, see Public Statements of Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">Robert S. McNamara</persName>, 1967, vol. VII, pp. 2545–2570.</note> which I had
            sent him), <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> and troop levels—as being issues which
            could, but I hoped would not, result in differences between us.</p>
                    <p>2. <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>, force
            levels—The Chancellor expressed similar satisfaction with the Washington meeting. He was
            writing a letter to the President bringing him up to date on events which have
            transpired in the meantime.<note n="5" xml:id="d231fn5">The next letter from Kiesinger
              to <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>, December 8, 1967, is in the Johnson
              Library, National Security File, Special Head of State Correspondence, Germany.</note>
            He was not concerned about our limited <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment.
            (At the earlier meeting he had asked about the probable effect of our <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment on the Japanese willingness to sign an <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>—and whether the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> might
            not some day be accepted as a defensive weapon and excluded from treaty control.) His
            principal concern about the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> was to avoid giving the
            Sovs a basis for future political pressure or blackmail against Germany. If a limited
            duration could be agreed upon for the treaty, and he had gathered from what he had been
            told in Washington that this was not beyond the realm of possibility, it would be most
            helpful. He did not refer to the current German objections to the Sov draft Article III.
            As far as force levels are concerned, he could assure me that <pb n="588" xml:id="pg_588" facs="0618"/>any reductions would be less than the 19,000 maximum
            figure he had mentioned in Washington. In fact, it might not be necessary to announce
            any reductions at all. He expressed bitterness over DefMin Schroeder's stubbornness in
            injecting a possible 60,000 man reduction into the public debate on this issue. I
            emphasized the importance, from the standpoint of the American reaction, to the form of
            the announcement. We hoped there would be no reduction. If there is, we hope it will not
            be necessary to announce specific quantitative reductions which are only contemplated
            several years hence.</p>
                    <p>3. Initiatives to the East—I asked the Chancellor what significance he attached to the
            recent proposal made by <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> Brandt to Sov Amb
              <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName> (Embtels 2681, 2737, 2964).<note n="6" xml:id="d231fn6">All three telegrams reported details of the Brandt-<persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName> initiative. Telegram 2681 from Bonn,

              telegram 2964 from Bonn, September 18 is ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss>
              38–6.</note> The Chancellor displayed a feeling of impatience with the whole
            affair—saying that the proposal was of no consequence. (We have learned that he was not
            informed in advance.) Brandt had merely advised <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName> of some of the points made in the German Govt's policy
            statement. In his own discussion with <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName>,
              <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName> had made no reference to the
            proposal. He had merely gone over the usual three Sov conditions for improved relations
            with the East and asked the Chancellor whether Germany could accept the bloc security
            proposals made at Karlsbad. In the Chancellor's view the Sovs are determined to maintain
            the status quo and have no desire for improving their relations with Germany—unless the
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> would agree to accept the status quo. This is
            impossible. Any improvement in German-Russian relations is a very long-range affair. He
            is worried about excessive hopes that have been aroused by people who have spoken
            publicly “out of hope rather than fact” (obviously referring to Amb-at-Large Bahr whose
            unauthorized statements have evoked unauthorized widespread expectations from Brandt's
            proposal to <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName>). The possibility of
            Germany becoming an ally of the Sov Union does not exist. There is too deep a background
            of distrust. In the Chancellor's view nothing useful could now be derived from a
            European security conference or an initiative on the German/European security question
            on the part of the West. In response to my query, he said that he did not think a visit
            by <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> Brandt to Moscow was likely, nor did he
            think anything useful could come from such a visit. In fact, the word that he had gotten
            indirectly from Sov officials was that they would only be interested in seeing him. In
            answer to my query he made clear that there had been no official suggestion of this
            nature coming from the Sov side, moreover, he did not think that any good could come
            from such a visit in view of the present Sov attitude.</p>
                    <pb n="589" xml:id="pg_589" facs="0619"/>
                    <p>4. Eastern policy—In the Chancellor's view his govt now has a well-balanced Eastern
            policy, which lies between the extremes as represented in the <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> by Bahr-<persName corresp="#p_LR7">Lahr</persName>, i.e., the
            conservative State Sec for Econ Affairs <persName corresp="#p_LR7">Lahr</persName> and
            the liberal Amb Bahr. It is a position that he can hold with the rank and file of his
            party. He saw no advantage in Germany's giving up anything on the Oder-Neisse at this
            time merely to assuage the Poles. It would only result in a stabilization of the status
            quo.</p>
                    <p>In response to my query as to the likely effect of German concessions on Polish
            dependence on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, he replied that it was not a
            question of what the Polish people wanted but the position of the Polish regime—who
            presumably had no desire for decreased dependence. In the Chancellor's view the present
            German task is a long-range effort requiring great patience to establish confidence on
            the part of the East Europeans, as they have attempted to do with their Western Allies.
            Sooner or later the East Europeans, who would like to have close ties with the West
            Germans particularly for economic reasons, will be willing to take steps in this
            direction despite the position of <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>—who is
            not popular with the Eastern European leaders.</p>
                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_SW6">Stoph</persName> letter—I asked the Chancellor what he
            made of the last <persName corresp="#p_SW6">Stoph</persName> letter. Would it lead
            anywhere? Would he be willing to meet <persName corresp="#p_SW6">Stoph</persName>
            under suitable conditions? The Chancellor replied that the <persName corresp="#p_SW6">Stoph</persName> letter, in his judgment, was calculated to put an end to the
            discussion of meetings and improvement of relations between East and West Germany. He
            would however, make some sort of response. Had <persName corresp="#p_SW6">Stoph</persName> been clever he would have proposed a meeting with the Chancellor
            without conditions. Although the Chancellor's counter-proposal would probably have been
            to demand an agenda, it is quite possible that a meeting could have been arranged. All
              <persName corresp="#p_SW6">Stoph</persName> had to do then would have been to meet,
            demand recognition of East Germany and—when this was not accepted—go back and make
            political advantage out of the fact of the meeting itself.</p>

                    <p>Dear Mr. Secretary:</p>
                    <p>I wish to bring to your attention a study prepared by the Embassy on the subject, “To
            What Extent Should We Be Concerned about German Dealings with The East?”<note n="2" xml:id="d232fn2">The paper was transmitted in airgram A–459 from Bonn, October 12.
              (Ibid.)</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>As is pointed out in the airgram, the United States Government has generally endorsed
            German initiatives in this field and has so far attempted to set no limits on them, in
            regard to either procedure or substance. At some point, however, there is a possibility
            of misunderstandings arising if the Germans, in pursuing contacts with the East, were to
            enter into areas of discussion—or agreement—which affect US and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> interests. It would therefore seem to be prudent to attempt to define
            those areas where we would make it clear that we expect advance consultation and
            coordination. You may recall that I touched on this matter briefly in an earlier
            telegram (Bonn 2654).<note n="3" xml:id="d232fn3">
                            <ref target="#d229">Document 229</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>To summarize our conclusions, we find no presently foreseeable difficulties in regard
            to the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>'s pursuit of expanded or improved bilateral
            relations either with East Germany, the other small countries of Eastern Europe or with
            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. These activities, as a rule, do not appear
            directly to affect US or Western interests. Indeed, they are fully consonant with and
            should serve to support our own objectives. The existing consultative procedures are
            believed to be adequate.</p>
                    <p>In regard to multilateral affairs, however, it is believed that there lie potential
            misunderstandings. This is particularly true of European security arrangements, in which
            the Federal Government under Kiesinger and Brandt has shown a particular interest. The
            various proposals in this field generally affect US interests—as well as those of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> as a whole. As a rule, our views coincide with the
            current German attitudes. However, at some future date, the Germans might feel compelled
            to push ahead faster than the circumstances call for—on such proposals as a mutual
            reduction of foreign troops in Germany, which we both endorse in principle, or to
            consider communist proposals such as the Rapacki Plan, which under foreseeable
            circumstances would be disadvantageous to the West. On appropriate occasions, we should
            make our views on these problems clear to the Germans in order to avoid pitfalls of
            misunderstanding.</p>

                    <p>4358. Subj: Soviet memorandum on European security. Ref: Bonn 4342.<note n="2" xml:id="d233fn2">Telegram 4342, October 18, forwarded a translation of the text of an
              October 12 Soviet memorandum handed by <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName> to Brandt. For text, see Documents on Germany, 1944 -1985, pp.
              964–966.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>1. The Soviet memorandum, while businesslike and free from polemics, is rigid in
            substance.</p>
                    <p>2. It is not surprising that the Soviets selected from the various topics suggested by
            the Germans for discussion the proposal for an exchange of non-use-of-force
            declarations, for they had been given an opening to exploit. This proposal dates back to
            the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>'s peace note of March 25, 1966.<note n="3" xml:id="d233fn3">See ibid., pp. 914–917.</note> However, the Kiesinger government
            added an attractive nuance to the original proposal by indicating, in various
            pronouncements <pb n="592" xml:id="pg_592" facs="0622"/>including the original
            government declaration of December 13, that the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
            could in some way be included under the mantle of the exchange of non-force
            declarations.</p>
                    <p>3. By offering this come-on, the Germans did not have in mind exchanging declarations
            with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, but rather some formula whereby the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>'s pledges of non-use of force would apply to its border
            with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. However, the Soviets have come back with
            the rigid condition that “the Soviet Union can give its consent to negotiations about
            the exchange of statements renouncing the use of force only if the Federal Republic, for
            its part, expresses its readiness to exchange respective declarations with the German
            Democratic Republic …”</p>
                    <p>4. The Germans will not want to accept this condition, and so the Soviet-German
            exchanges on this proposal do not seem likely to lead anywhere, unless the Soviets were
            unexpectedly to lower their demands. However, the Germans will probably want to respond
            with a counter-offer in order to further probe Soviet intentions and to give the
            impression of some motion in German-Soviet relations.</p>
                    <p>5. An interesting sidelight of the Soviet memorandum is the fact that it ignored
            completely the German offer to discuss mutual force reductions. This omission would seem
            to confirm the Department's judgment (State 52708)<note n="4" xml:id="d233fn4">Dated
              October 2. (Department of State, Central Files, DEF 6 <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>)</note> that the Soviets are not interested in such an arrangement

                        </item>
                    </list>
                    <p>From Embassy Bonn's reports, and from the observations of Al Puhan, who has just
            returned from three weeks in the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, it is possible to
            state:</p>
                    <p>1. The <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> is not now an issue with much salience for
            German public opinion. The problem is too complicated to capture popular attention, and
            no politician has yet thought it worth his while to “simplify” it in a manner that would
            lend it salience. <persName corresp="#p_PA7">Puhan</persName> compares it with the MLF:
            few Germans really roused themselves to much concern about the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. In his travels about the country he noted that even people with
            considerable political sophistication did not often place the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> high on their list of concerns.</p>
                    <p>2. Nevertheless, among the 50 or 60 top politicians and officials, <persName corresp="#p_PA7">Puhan</persName> says, there is not one who supports the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>. Attitudes range from total hostility, represented by
            people like Stoltenberg, <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName>, and the
            Springer press, to distaste but grudging acceptance, represented by Kiesinger and now by
            Brandt. There is a general feeling that we have knowingly misled them by retreating from
            the position which we worked out in the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>3. The principal source of dissatisfaction is no specific article, but rather the view,
            propagated by <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> and many others, that the
              <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>
                        <pb n="594" xml:id="pg_594" facs="0624"/>symbolizes a U.S.-Soviet “deal” made behind
            Germany's back and at her expense. <persName corresp="#p_PA7">Puhan</persName> noted
            that even left-wing student leaders with whom he talked, essentially pacifists and
            nuclear-disarmers, strongly objected to the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> as a
            U.S.-Soviet “diktat.”</p>
                    <p>4. Article III<note n="2" xml:id="d235fn2">This article of the draft treaty dealt with
              safeguards.</note> has become an issue in part by default: because objection to the
            treaty in principle would be internationally awkward, German objections have focussed on
            Article III. <persName corresp="#p_PA7">Puhan</persName> attributes this in large degree
            to <persName corresp="#p_SS11">Schnippenkoetter</persName> himself, who is remarkably
            influential in shaping German attitudes at the highest levels on this issue.</p>
                    <p>5. The greatest danger we face is that a politician such as <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> will choose to blow the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> up
            into an explosive national issue, as the Springer press has been trying without much
            success to do. It is conceivable that <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName>
            could use opposition to the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> as a means of splitting
            the <gloss target="#t_CSU1">CSU</gloss> off from the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>, and in so doing provide a much more “respectable” focus towards which
            nationalist Germans could rally.</p>
                    <p>6. The Germans do not place much faith in the tactic of threatening not to ratify the
              <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> as a means of assuring a satisfactory agreement
            between Euratom and the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>. They fear, with some
            reason, that the other four non-nuclear-weapon members of Euratom would not stand by
            them, leaving them isolated. <persName corresp="#p_PA7">Puhan</persName> believes that
            the chances of German ratification, even with a draft acceptable to them, are not much
            better than even.</p>
                    <p>7. We gave the Russians a revision of their draft Article III yesterday. It picks up
            some key language from the “illustrative” draft the Germans presented in the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>. It is important, now, that our people at Geneva should
            dig in their heels on this version, and not give way to what will surely be a good deal
            of Soviet pressure. We should also put a lot of emphasis now on close and high-level
            consultation with the Germans.</p>

                    <p rend="center">THE DIVISION OF GERMANY</p>
                    <p>This memorandum tries to develop a broad perspective on the problem posed by the
            division of Germany. <hi rend="italic">It does not prescribe specific policies but does
              draw some general longer-term guidelines</hi>.</p>
                    <p>The following factors make timely another look at the division of Germany:</p>
                    <p>a) significant changes are occurring in the German outlook; this includes the
            Coalition's new Eastern policy, some disillusionment with the US and the Atlantic
            Alliance, and growing ambivalence about <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
            Gaulle</persName>'s concepts;</p>
                    <p>b) <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>'s policy—including the growing
            speculation that he may leave <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>—is pushing the
            Germans towards a re-examination of the relationship between Western unity and their
            national position;</p>
                    <p>c) the Soviet Union is currently pursuing a policy designed to isolate Bonn; however,
            this could be a preliminary to an eventual initiative designed to exploit German
            frustrations by direct Moscow-Bonn approaches.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. Bonn's New German Policy in Historical Perspective</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> policy on the German question is, for the first
            time, in a state of flux. The possible implications of this condition emerge more
            clearly when viewed in a historical perspective.</p>
                    <p>Since 1250, except for a few years under Hitler, all Germans have never lived together
            in one unified state. On the contrary, they have always been divided by religion,
            traditions, and outlooks.</p>
                    <p>Bismarck's Reich, a relatively recent historical phenomenon, became so powerful and
            expansionist that international politics until 1945 were largely dominated by its
            neighbors' struggles to prevent Germany from dominating Europe, if not the world. Twice
            this proved possible only through the involvement of non-European powers, the United
            States and (in World War II) the Soviet Union. 1919 brought amputation from Germany of
            what is now Central Poland. Moreover, Germany was forbidden the annexation of Austria
            and the Sudetenland (i.e., the unity <pb n="596" xml:id="pg_596" facs="0626"/>of all
            Germans). 1945 brought the loss of what is now Western Poland and (after 1947) the
            present division of the remaining German-settled territory. In short, all-German unity
            was brief, and unacceptable to its neighbors.</p>
                    <p>Moscow never intended, at least after 1955, to permit the unification of Germany under
            any but its own terms—if then. Rather, Soviet policy has remained determined to
            consolidate and perpetuate an East German state under Communist rule and Soviet
            hegemony. German hopes die slowly; but the 1961 Berlin Wall and President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s speech of October 7, 1966, have helped to
            convince West Germans that reunification in the foreseeable future is just not in the
            cards.</p>
                    <p>While it is difficult to gauge the depth of German national sentiment, the experience
            of having had a national state, as well as the obvious fact that most other nations live
            in nation-states, makes the Germans feel that their partition is unjust and should be
            undone. <hi rend="italic">Their current pessimism about reunification does not mean
              acceptance of permanent division; rather, it focuses national attention on what seems
              to be more realizable</hi>, given present international realities: improving the lot
            of their countrymen in the East. The Kiesinger-<persName corresp="#p_WH6">Wehner</persName> Grand Coalition translated this changed mood into the new official
            West German policy of active engagement toward the East, including East Germany.</p>
                    <p>The underlying factors which led to this adjustment have been:</p>
                    <p>(1) Rising German nationalism: the desire to translate rising German economic and
            financial power into a more independent foreign policy;</p>
                    <p>(2) German youth's lack of guilt for Nazi Germany;</p>
                    <p>(3) Germans' disillusionment with the standstill on European unity, and their
            consequent search for other inspiring goals;</p>
                    <p>(4) their belief, arising from the post-Cuba US–<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
            détente and rising differentiation in Eastern Europe, that now something could also be
            accomplished on the German question; and, above all,</p>
                    <p>(5) their frustration with the post-Berlin Wall cut-back in contacts with East Germany
            and from the lack of liberalization there, in the context of growing disillusionment
            with the likelihood of reunification;</p>
                    <p>(6) the increasing feeling that East Germany, with the passage of time, is becoming
            more viable.</p>
                    <p>Thus greater West German pressure for movement on the German question has confronted
            Soviet determination to be rigid. The result has been the deflection of the rising West
            German pressures for reunification toward a different strategy: a policy of active
            engagement with the East European states, the Soviet Union, and East Germany itself. <hi rend="italic">This policy seeks the only goal now viewed by most West Germans as a
              realistic one for the near future: humanization of conditions in East Germany and
              gradual re-establishment of West German contacts with it</hi>.</p>
                    <pb n="597" xml:id="pg_597" facs="0627"/>
                    <p>Not that most West Germans have given up reunification as the eventual goal. Many
            Germans continue to hope that at some unforseen point the Soviet Union may find itself
            in disarray or unable to control developments in Eastern Europe. At that stage, the two
            Germanys could come together through a fait accompli, and this is why keeping German
            national sentiment alive is so vital. But this hope apart, most Germans have,
            reluctantly, recognized that reunification is not an attainable goal in the near
            future.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Alternative Futures</p>
                    <p>The change in the German attitude is a realistic one. German reunification, in the
            sense of recreating a Bismarckian Reich, is not in the cards. It is not likely to be
            achieved either through Western unity or through dissolution of alliances. In the rather
            unlikely event that it could be achieved through the latter method, it would not be in
            the West's interest.</p>
                    <p>a. Reunification Through Western Unity</p>
                    <p>This involves essentially two variants:</p>
                    <p>i) Reunification Through Cold War</p>
                    <p>The first—the cold war approach—requires relatively little discussion. To the extent
            that anyone ever seriously believed that Germany could be reunited in the context of a
            hostile East-West confrontation, the events of the last fifteen years have clearly
            proven this approach to be unrealistic. German reunification is no closer—indeed, it is
            even less likely—today than it was when Stalin died or when <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> decided to permit West Germany's rearmament. No Western government today
            subscribes to the notion that there can be no détente unless there is first progress on
            the question of German reunification—not even the Government of <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. Unless suddenly and unexpectedly the Soviet Union collapses, this
            approach is dead.</p>
                    <p>ii) Reunification Through Western Integration</p>
                    <p>This brings us to an alternative approach, involving the absorption of East as well as
            West Germany into, and their containment by, an integrated Western European
            community.</p>
                    <p>Since Moscow would hardly ever accept both a continuation of the present bilateral
            political and defense arrangements between Bonn and Washington and absorption of East
            Germany into an integrated Western European community with close defense ties to the US,
            and since, conversely, most of Western Europe, including West Germany, will probably
            increasingly wish to adopt a less dependent stance vis-à-vis the United States, it is
            possible that a Western Europe so integrated, and visibly less dependent on us, would
            satisfy European (including German) and Soviet security needs. This could be so, even
            though the Soviet Union has strongly opposed Germany's integration into Western Europe
            and would still like to minimize it.</p>
                    <pb n="598" xml:id="pg_598" facs="0628"/>
                    <p>There can be little doubt that an <hi rend="italic">integrated Western Europe is bound
              to cause an important evolution in Communist perspectives</hi>. Eastern European trade
            with West Europe is the primary source of hard currency for Communist economies, and
            thus the development of established, normal commercial relations with a prosperous
            European Economic Community will become an increasingly important factor in the further
            economic development of the Communist states. In time, such a changed economic
            perspective could lead to a changed perspective in politics. Eventually, the Communist
            elites may come to see an integrated Western Europe, one which absorbs German energies
            and ambitions, as something in their interest as well.</p>
                    <p>The development of greater appreciation in the East for the common European stake in
            West European integration would be furthered if such a more integrated West were
            consciously to strive, bilaterally and multilaterally, to develop cooperative East-West
            relationships. Participation of the Communist states especially in <hi rend="italic">a
              wider multilateral framework of East-West cooperation</hi>, pointing towards the
            economic reunification of Europe, would be bound to have a Europeanizing impact on the
            Communist elites themselves. It would help to develop in the East a European-minded
            technical and economic elite, and eventually to encourage also the appearance of a more
            broadminded, less parochial attitude within the political elite itself.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, since multilateral cooperation is incompatible with a high degree of internal
            state-controlled and centralized planning, pressures for domestic liberalization would
            be intensified. Thus greater involvement of the East European states in institutional
            and multilateral forms of cooperation with an integrated Western community would help
            the internal processes of evolution in the East, all of which cumulatively would promote
            the emergence of a new political attitude.</p>
                    <p>Eventually, the Communist elites could become less inclined to see their security as
            dependent on the maintenance of the present European status quo. With the political
            evolution slowly reducing the doctrinal Communist stake in a Communist East Germany, the
            division of Europe could become more susceptible to peaceful change.</p>
                    <p>But even then, <hi rend="italic">it is most unlikely that the Communist side could
              consent to East Germany joining a politically, economically and militarily integrated
              Western Europe with close Atlantic ties</hi>. The Soviet Union could have no
            conceivable reason for permitting East Germany simply to slide over into a Western
            community that—from its point of view—could become easily dominated by a powerful and
            rearmed West Germany. In this connection, one should not underestimate the depth of
            popular fears in Eastern Europe and Russia of West German access to nuclear weapons.
            Moreover, the absorption of Eastern Germany would mean a fundamental shift in the
            balance of power, not to speak of the loss of Soviet control <pb n="599" xml:id="pg_599" facs="0629"/>over the industrial resources of East Germany, very important to the
            economic development of the Soviet Union. Even with ideological erosion, the absorption
            of East Germany by the West would be tantamount to a major ideological setback for
            Communism.</p>
                    <p>b. Dissolution of Alliances</p>
                    <p>German reunification is also not likely through a dissolution of alliances, although a
            plausible case can be made that the Soviet Union would be more likely to countenance the
            reunification of a neutral Germany, either detached from the West or in the setting of
            an East-West dissolution of alliances. Essentially two variants can be envisaged:</p>
                    <p>i) Reunification Through Dissolution of Alliances</p>
                    <p>This approach—the dissolution of alliances school of thought—is quite popular today. It
            is easy to see why. Many are tired with the cold war. <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> appears old-fashioned—primarily an agency of the cold war. There is a
            facile simple-minded attraction to the Ceausescu-<persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName> argument: abolish the cold war by abolishing the blocs, or vice
            versa.</p>
                    <p>Yet this argument is not only deceptively attractive; it is dangerously wrong. A
            politically fragmented Western Europe would be a Europe incapable of steering in a
            common direction on behalf of commonly shared goals. Détente for the sake of détente
            could be the only common denominator of a policy that would be tantamount to Western
            rivalry in seeking to improve relations and to develop advantageous trade with the
            East.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Accordingly, it is probably true that a loosely organized Europe,
              primarily as a free trade area, lacking an integrated political and defense structure,
              not tied closely to the United States, could more easily reach a détente with the
              Soviet Union and Eastern Europe</hi>. For the East, accommodation with such a Europe
            would not require any substantial ideological evolution, especially since no special
            concessions or adjustments in the Eastern position would be required. The Communist
            elites, not fearing such a Europe, would probably be quite responsive to Western
            overtures because they could thus have their cake and eat it too: they could savor the
            tangible benefits of closer economic contacts with the West without any substantial
            change in the over-all political situation, including that of Germany.</p>
                    <p>In this connection, it is important to bear in mind that the present Communist elites,
            especially the East European ones, are still in the early stages of post-peasant
            political awakening. By and large, their political attitudes are a curious mixture of
            some Communist formulae and of rather intense nationalism. Their general outlook is
            basically parochial and conservative. A détente that perpetuates their domestic
            dictatorships and leaves the European political map unchanged would thus be for them the
            ideal solution.</p>
                    <pb n="600" xml:id="pg_600" facs="0630"/>
                    <p>Whether a détente of this kind would be stable is another matter. There are strong
            reasons for skepticism. It would mean a re-creation of a Europe based on the old
            principle of state supremacy, with a major European nation, the German one, probably
            condemned to indefinite division. In those circumstances frustration in West Germany
            would almost certainly ensue. Having attained neither any major progress toward national
            unity nor fulfillment in a larger European community, the Germans could be expected to
            seek accommodation with the Soviet Union. Irrespective of original Soviet motives—even
            if it is assumed that Moscow was sincerely seeking a stable détente in Europe—the
            temptation to exploit German frustrations could well become too strong for Moscow to
            resist.</p>
                    <p>Finally, if Germany was reunited in the setting of a less united Europe—assuming Moscow
            agreed to it—the result would be to re-create many of the instabilities that have
            plagued the European order since 1870. That, given present trends, the dissolution of
            alliances could be the most likely sequence of events does not obviate the point that a
            stable solution for the German problem is not to be found in the re-creation of the pre
            World War II European system of nation-states. It is difficult to conceive reasons how
            this could be in the interest of the West.</p>
                    <p>ii) Reunification Through a Soviet-German Deal</p>
                    <p>A variant of this approach involves the reunification of Germany through a
            Soviet-German deal. Such a deal would require a standstill in European integration, very
            intense German frustration with the country's division, and a US divorce from Europe.
            These are all conditions over which some control can be exercised: the West can, if it
            wishes, move towards greater unity; German frustration can be diminished both by greater
            involvement in Europe and by some progress in inter-German relations; a US-European
            divorce is not inevitable.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, the fact that the East Europeans, particularly the Poles and the Czechs,
            would oppose such a Moscow-Bonn (Berlin) deal, cannot be entirely disregarded. In
            addition, granting the obvious Soviet interest in disrupting Western unity by such a
            deal, the Soviet leaders would probably think hard before embarking on a policy that
            would mean the loss of East Germany in exchange for a neutral Germany in the setting of
            a suddenly destabilized Europe. The Soviet stake in European stability is not
            insignificant. This does not mean, however, that the Soviet Union will not hold out the
            prospect of a deal, in the hope of loosening German ties with the West, but without the
            intention to consummate the deal itself.</p>
                    <p>Nonetheless, obviously the possibility that Moscow and Bonn could decide some day to
            strike a deal cannot be excluded altogether. At some point, the Soviet Union could
            decide—rightly or wrongly—that its interests would be best served by a neutralized
            Germany, arranged by a bilateral <pb n="601" xml:id="pg_601" facs="0631"/>agreement.
            Some Europeans might also favor that solution. Precisely because that possibility
            exists, it is important to reiterate that such a sudden and basic reversal in the
            structure of post <hi rend="italic">World War II European political politics could not
              help but introduce a new phase of European instability, new international rivalries,
              new tensions</hi>.</p>
                    <p>3. More Palatable Division</p>
                    <p>It is in the West's interest that the Germans remain committed to Western unity, even
            if reunification is not realizable. Hence, if the issue of the division of Germany
            cannot be solved, it is important to maintain the impression of progress towards a
            solution of the German problem while at the same time prompting, to the extent possible,
            an abatement of German interest in the problem of the division of Germany. <hi rend="italic">This points towards a policy that makes progress towards reunification
              the equivalent of making the division more palatable</hi>.</p>
                    <p>This objective is to be sought in the context of broader East-West conciliation. Such
            reconciliation will not be achieved by a single act of settlement, nor will a resolution
            of the German problem be an event isolated in time; a gradual process of growing
            together of the East and the West and of the existing two German entities will be
            required. This proc-ess will have economic, cultural, political and security aspects. It
            is likely to involve gradual expansion in all-German contacts, in a setting of related
            changes in the West, in the East, and in the nature of East-West relations. All these
            changes have to be viewed in a dynamic perspective; a rigidly divided Germany can only
            endure in a divided Europe, while ending the division of Europe requires simultaneously
            a transformation of divided Germany into something less prone to tensions and more
            acceptable to the Germans.</p>
                    <p>How long the East-West process of reconciliation will take is difficult to predict, and
            conflicts in the Third World could cause major setbacks in Europe. Moreover, the Soviet
            and East European Communist leaders are likely to obstruct a real reconciliation,
            fearing its impact on their domestic position. Nonetheless, the process of change in
            Europe has been moving considerably more rapidly than anyone would have predicted a
            decade and a half ago.</p>
                    <p>What follows is a summary of the kind of changes that would have to take place for the
            process of reconciliation to result in a new relationship between the divided parts of
            Germany. It is not asserted that these changes will happen; it is asserted that they are
            desirable, that they are all sufficiently possible to be worth serious attention, and
            that some of them can be encouraged by the West.</p>
                    <p>a. Related Changes in the West</p>
                    <p>As already noted, West European unity is a factor of stability and contributes to
            positive evolution in the East. More specifically the following points should be
            reiterated:</p>
                    <pb n="602" xml:id="pg_602" facs="0632"/>
                    <p>(1) <hi rend="italic">An Integrated Context</hi>: A more united Western Europe promises
            to dampen and ultimately submerge German nationalism and reduce the danger that a change
            in the division of Germany would upset the peace of Europe. Hence it will be important
            for Western European integration and political unification to move forward, both to
            enhance the prospects of détente and to discourage the tendency toward fragmentation
            noted above.</p>
                    <p>(2) <hi rend="italic">
                            <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                        </hi> Entry: <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> entry into Europe would help greatly to
            offset the Eastern fear of Europe's domination by a unified Germany, a fear which
            inhibits even modest progress on the German issue.</p>
                    <p>(3) <hi rend="italic">German Nuclear Abnegation</hi>: Western European defense and
            security arrangements—including perhaps a European defense force—should not include West
            German access to nuclear weapons: Hence any defense community should include a special
            clause providing for self-imposed German abstinence in the nuclear field, relating that
            abnegation to progress toward the eventual goal of German reunification (perhaps
            allowing a lapse in, say, ten years, if no acceptable progress towards humanization of
            conditions in East Germany and closer East-West ties has been made).</p>
                    <p>Such abnegation is no longer viewed by all Germans as involving discrimination: The
              <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> is already moving towards such a nuclear
            abnegation by the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>; also the cost of deploying
            Poseidon missiles and <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>s makes it less likely that
            West Germany or, indeed, Western Europe, will want to deploy credible national or
            multinational nuclear forces.</p>
                    <p>In addition, of course, the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and France remain
            adamantly opposed to German access to nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>(4) <hi rend="italic">Somewhat Looser Atlantic Ties</hi>: Declining US military
            presence in Western Europe, matching both greater West European efforts to assure their
            security and gradual reduction in Soviet presence in Central Europe, would be in keeping
            with the trend away from the post-1945 two blocs-confrontation, provided that the
            general US-Soviet strategic balance does not become unfavorable to the US.</p>
                    <p>b. Related Changes in the East</p>
                    <p>(1) <hi rend="italic">Ideological Evolution</hi>: The erosion of the more militant
            aspects of Marxism-Leninism would permit the Communist leaders to view greater unity in
            the West not as a threat to themselves but as a logical and even positive development,
            inherent in modern economic and social organization. The Sino-Soviet dispute and
            domestic pressures in the Soviet Union both conspire to bring on such a changed
            perspective, although it will not happen rapidly.</p>
                    <p>(2) <hi rend="italic">Political Moderation</hi>: Although for a long time to come the
            Soviet Union and most of the East European states will remain single-party
            dictatorships, their systems could gradually become more tolerant of political <pb n="603" xml:id="pg_603" facs="0633"/>and intellectual dissent, thereby also weakening
            the role of ideology. Yugoslavia is a pioneer in this respect. Czechoslovakia may be the
            next to follow. The evolution of single-party dictatorships in Mexico and Spain—mutatis
            mutandis—may serve as an example.</p>
                    <p>(3) <hi rend="italic">Internal Economic Reforms</hi>: Progressive decentralization of
            the Communist economies would facilitate international economic cooperation, hitherto
            handicapped by centralized national planning. It would also facilitate the emergence of
            a more independent, technologically oriented economic elite, likely to have a strong
            interest in economic cooperation with Western Europe and the United States. This would
            be the more true since the technological gap between the West and the East may be
            expected to widen rather than narrow.</p>
                    <p>(4) <hi rend="italic">Regional Economic Cooperation</hi>: <gloss target="#t_CEMA1">CEMA</gloss> would abandon its efforts at economic integration of Eastern Europe and
            even Mongolia with the Soviet Union. Rather, it would concentrate on the promotion of
            trade and exchange of technological know-how. Clearing and convertibility would be
            arranged. More important would be the proliferation of more specialized subregional
            arrangements among the East European states, such as Intermetal. Closer industrial and
            energy cooperation is to be expected among East Germany, Poland, and Czechoslovakia,
            thereby stimulating greater recognition of the merits of regional cooperation.</p>
                    <p>(5) <hi rend="italic">Alliance</hi>: The Warsaw Pact would not be formally disbanded,
            but Soviet combat troops would be withdrawn from Poland and Hungary. The Alliance would
            serve as a symbol of political interdependence: for the Soviet Union as a guarantee of
            minimal political loyalty, for the East European Communist elites as a safeguard against
            the eruption of domestic pressures into revolution and, in the case of Poland and
            Czechoslovakia, as an assurance of Soviet support for their territorial integrity.
            Otherwise, the East European regimes would be quite independent, and their own estimate
            of their interest would be determining in their foreign relations—i.e., they would move
            toward the present foreign policy of Romania.</p>
                    <p>c. East-West Relations</p>
                    <p>The process of growing together in part will be a spontaneous one: in part, it will
            have to be stimulated by deliberate initiatives designed to undo gradually the partition
            of Europe. It is to be expected that the Soviet Union will try to exploit these to its
            ends. Nonetheless, the broad trend, it may be anticipated, favors an improvement in
            East-West relations.</p>
                    <p>Extensive development of East-West bilateral ties began in the late fifties and early
            sixties. It is to be expected that during the next generation there might be an
            expansion not only in these bilateral relationships but a significant development in
            East-West multilateral economic cooperation.</p>
                    <pb n="604" xml:id="pg_604" facs="0634"/>
                    <p>During this period the <gloss target="#t_ECE1">ECE</gloss> might become more active in
            developing East-West economic and technical cooperation. <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> might also become involved in assisting East-West scientific and
            technological collaboration.</p>
                    <p>Some kind of special East-West economic assembly, perhaps sponsored by <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_ECE1">ECE</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CEMA1">CEMA</gloss>, or the Council of Europe, eventually could be created.
            It would foster joint East-West ventures and communications, technological cooperation,
            etc. It could make special studies of the difficult problem of arranging multilateral
            cooperation between free market and state-controlled economies.</p>
                    <p>Surplus labor force might be permitted to flow Westward from the East, with
            considerable social-cultural impact on its return home. (This is already the case with
            Yugoslavia.)</p>
                    <p>Most of the East European states and the Soviet Union would become associated with
              <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>, in
            addition to perhaps negotiating special agreements with <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>. (Yugoslavia may well become an associate member of the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> within the next five to ten years.)</p>
                    <p>The next decade might see some movement towards the creation of an East-West Political
            Assembly, for the purpose of discussing directly, and on a continuing basis, East-West
            issues. It could also become a forum for the development of a common US, European and
            Soviet attitude towards the problems of the Third World. Even more rapid might be the
            gradual involvement of the Communist states in the specialized functions of the Council
            of Europe.</p>
                    <p>Although the security issue remains the hardest nut to crack, gradual progress in this
            field would probably also develop. Given sufficient Western initiative, a European
            Security Commission based on the two alliances (hence including both the US and the
            Soviet Union) might be established, for the purpose of monitoring troop movements in
            Central Europe and for making periodic inspections of troop postures. Reciprocal troop
            withdrawals from Germany might take place even earlier, as well as some discussions
            concerning the definition of mutually acceptable limits on military development in
            Central Europe, compatible with German non-nuclear defense commitments to Western Europe
            or <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>d. Closer Relations Between the Two German Entities</p>
                    <p>The basic ingredients of a new relationship between the two Germanys can be only
            sketched out in a tentative way:</p>
                    <p>(1) Its principal feature would be the joint administration of utilities and services
            such as waterways, railroads, electric grids, posts, telegraph, etc. From such a base
            economic and technical cooperation might gradually spread to other economic sectors,
            with both German entities surrendering some of their economic sovereignty to each other.
            Starting as literally joint bodies, representing the two sides, mixed administrative <pb n="605" xml:id="pg_605" facs="0635"/>commissions could be transformed gradually into
            more independent all-German regulatory agencies.</p>
                    <p>(2) Eventually, East Germany might acquire association status with <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>, especially if internal economic reforms bring it to at
            least the stage already reached by Yugoslavia. At the same time, since withdrawal of the
              <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> from <gloss target="#t_CEMA1">CEMA</gloss> would
            make a shambles out of Eastern European cooperation, continued <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> participation in some forms of Eastern European economic cooperation and
              <gloss target="#t_CEMA1">CEMA</gloss> would be expected. For example, there would be
            no inherent incompatibility between a <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> relationship
            with the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>, and <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
            participation in Intermetal. This is shown by current Yugoslav efforts to develop a
            working relationship both with the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CEMA1">CEMA</gloss>. Moreover, Austria at some point may also have such
            multiple links.</p>
                    <p>(3) An internationally more secure East German Government would be more likely to
            tolerate a wider margin of internal freedom, thereby alleviating the lot of the East
            German population and eliminating one of West German objections to two states. Moreover,
            the Soviet Union, having thus made progress toward one of its major European objectives,
            the stabilization of East Germany, would be more inclined to put pressure on East Berlin
            for liberalization, inter alia to bring East Germany more in line with the (by then)
            more liberalized East European states.</p>
                    <p>(4) The intractable problem of Berlin and the Wall would be perhaps the most difficult
            and sensitive aspect of the whole problem. Either the Wall would have to stay until
            improved East German economic conditions make flight unattractive, or the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> would have to agree to regulate the entry and residence
            of persons from the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> in a manner acceptable to the
            latter. Hence this might have to involve a <hi rend="italic">mutually regulated</hi>
            though more liberal flow of people between both parts of Germany, especially in view of
            closer economic ties.</p>
                    <p>(5) Formal commitment by both <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> that a reunified Germany will not seek to alter existing
            external German frontiers would be especially important in overcoming Polish and
            Czechoslovak fears of any move towards closer all-German ties.</p>
                    <p>We should recognize that both sides would participate in the proc-ess with conflicting
            objectives: <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> hoping to erode the division and GDR to
            perpetuate it. Whether the process of change would lead to confederation and later go
            beyond it is dependent on unpredictable changes in the external environment and in the
            German psyche.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">4. US Policy Implications</p>
                    <p>Taking our lead from West German policy on the German issue, the United States should
            place increasing stress on the process of German reassociation, in the context of
            broader East-West peaceful engagement. This would be in keeping with the increasingly
            widespread German feeling <pb n="606" xml:id="pg_606" facs="0636"/>that closer East-West
            German ties are a necessary stage on the way towards self-determination. A greater sense
            of shared allied purpose would thus be stimulated.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, East German, or Soviet obstructions to the development of such closer
            ties would have the effect of reducing the effectiveness of Communist efforts to portray
            both the <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
            as the principal obstacles to a European “détente”.</p>
                    <p>The overall effect would be to re-emphasize to the European public an important
            political point: for the East, an improvement in East-West relations is merely a device
            for freezing the status quo, in spite of all its inadequacies; for the West, it is a
            means for creating gradually and peacefully a more stable and secure order, acceptable
            to both West and East Europeans.</p>

                    <p>65712. From Secretary for Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName>.
            Ref: Your Airgram A–459.<note n="2" xml:id="d237fn2">See <ref target="#d232fn2">footnote
                2, Document 232</ref>.</note> Subj: German Relations with Eastern Europe.</p>
                    <p>1. I have read with great interest your airgram and accompanying letter. Senior
            officers of the Dept have studied both papers and agree with me that they are excellent
            and timely. We feel that with a few relatively minor changes the airgram would serve
            admirably as a basis on which you could recommend a plan of action as suggested in your
            letter.</p>
                    <p>2. Re question of <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> relations with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> (Section 2A, A–459) not clear to me precisely what you
            mean by de facto recognition of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, or how this would
            differ from present situation in which <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> acknowledges
            existence of an authority in East Germany and has some quasi-official relations with it.
            Would de facto recognition as you visualize it affect Allied access to Berlin? Could we
            continue to exclude East German regime from any participation in these arrangements?</p>
                    <pb n="607" xml:id="pg_607" facs="0637"/>
                    <p>3. I agree entirely with your views on bilateral <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_EE1">EE</gloss> exchanges of declarations on non-use of
            force. However, our view as to utility of Soviet proposal for a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>-Warsaw Pact non-aggression treaty would be governed by many other
            factors in addition to the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> view; e.g., wisdom of
            equating the two organizations, degree of progress toward European political
            integration, general state of East-West relations, our reading of trends in Soviet
            international policy.</p>
                    <p>4. Would be difficult to maintain U.S. troops in Germany if <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> should wish us to withdraw them. We would also, of course, want to avoid
            giving the Germans any justification for claiming we were responsible for lack of
            progress toward reunification. I hope we could at right time make point to <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> leaders that <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> cannot
            commit U.S. in advance to any bilateral <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>-Soviet
            understanding on withdrawal of foreign troops; but that such proposals, whatever their
            origin, would be appropriate subjects for close bilateral <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>-U.S. as well as <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> consultations.
            Subject of German neutralization is particularly difficult. I wonder whether we can
            assume its acceptability to us without knowing the situation in which it might arise as
            a serious proposal.</p>
                    <p>5. I share your view that we will have to move with considerable circumspection in
            discussing with the Germans the limitations we see in their freedom to enter into
            agreements with the Soviet Union; we would wish to avoid arousing resentment and
            suspicion. Your views on timing and techniques could of course be incorporated in your
            recommended plan of action.</p>

            conduct with the German <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> and high German
            officials. The basic intention in our original proposal (A–459) was to reassure the
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, in a low key, that their Eastern approach was
            within certain limits in harmony with our own—and to give them encouragement for the
            future. I do not see how such discussions if properly handled could have the opposite
            effect. That this is currently an active subject in Germany may be seen from Bonn's

                    </p>
                    <p>2. The differences between Brandt and Kiesinger to which you refer hinge, on the
            surface, on different estimates of prospects for progress in discussions with the
            Sovs—rather than on the substance of discussions. The basic cause of the differences,
            however, is believed to be rivalry in the conduct of foreign policy.<note n="5" xml:id="d238fn5">The Embassy reported on tensions between Brandt and Kiesinger in

            means, I believe, that we must maintain parallel contact with Kiesinger and give him
            full advantage of our views. The existence of a rival channel for European security
            issues between yourself and Brandt through Bowie to which Kiesinger is not a party
            could, I believe, be misunderstood by Kiesinger.</p>
                    <p>3. I now have an appointment with Kiesinger for next Tuesday, prior to his departure
            for a trip to South Asia. It would seem the normal thing for me to discuss East-West
            issues with him. Indeed, he will unquestionably raise it. There is moreover little in
            our recommended course of action that I have not discussed with Kiesinger before. I am
            sure that the French, in particular, discuss such matters freely with the Germans. Our
            failure to do so will, in my judgment, give the Germans the impression that we have no
            ideas concerning Eastern policy or that we are disinterested as a result of
            preoccupation elsewhere. It would also lead to misunderstandings on our side, such as
            that which arose from the Brandt-<persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName> 14
            point discussions, which was the principal reason why we raised this issue in the first

                    <p>5213. Subj: Meeting with Chancellor Kiesinger, East-West relations.</p>
                    <p>1. The present telegram summarizes the discussion of Germany's relations with the East
            which took place during the call I paid on Chancellor Kiesinger today at my request.
            Other subjects discussed are reported in septels.<note n="2" xml:id="d239fn2">

                    </p>
                    <p>2. I queried the Chancellor on his press statement made on Nov 3<note n="3" xml:id="d239fn3">For text, see Meissner, <hi rend="italic">Die deutsche
                Ostpolitik</hi>, pp. 230–231.</note> when he had, after repeating the standard
            German line that there can be no final agreement on the Oder-Neisse border except
            through a peace treaty, said: “That does not exclude, for example, that joint
            discussions of such a solution acceptable to both peoples could be arranged before such
            a peace treaty.” The Chancellor replied that there was in his view nothing to prevent
            such discussions, the purpose of which would be “just to build up a little more trust.”
            He is aware that the Poles do not, at the present time, consider the question a subject
            for discussion. The Poles are not willing even to accept the German offer for mutual
            declarations against the use of force. Apparently they feel that this would weaken their
            case in building Germany up as a threat. In response to my question, he elaborated on
            what he had in mind in making his statement—that he might tell the Poles that, although
            a final decision could only be made by a united Germany, “We could imagine, however, a
            solution along the lines of (blank).” Kiesinger did not appear to be fully informed as
            to Polish <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_RA4">Rapacki</persName>'s reported statement in Luxembourg on Nov
              4<note n="4" xml:id="d239fn4">Not found.</note> to the effect that Poland would be
            willing to normalize relations with Germany if the Oder-Neisse issue could be settled.
            After discussion with his aides he did not believe, however, that too much credence
            could be attached to this report. The fact is, he said, that the Poles do not believe
            the Germans when they offer assurances. He knows the Poles very well. They are
            suspicious by nature as a result of their unhappy contacts with the Prussians over the
            years (which was not the case in their contacts with southern Germans). The Poles tend
            to react in the light of what they would do if they were in the German position.</p>
                    <p>3. According to Kiesinger, German East-West efforts must be directed not just to the
            Communist countries. They must seek to convince <pb n="610" xml:id="pg_610" facs="0640"/>the whole world that although they will exercise their rights, they are seeking
            solutions in a responsible way on the basis of justice for all. In doing so they
            recognize fully that the first step must be the creation of a détente. Unification
            cannot be expected to precede détente. In his judgement, they should have moved more
            quickly in the beginning of his administration to establish relations with Hungary and
            perhaps other countries before <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> made his
            counter-attack. In response to my query about the rumors that they might move toward
            establishing diplomatic relations with Yugoslavia, he replied that the majority of the
              <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_CSU1">CSU</gloss> is not yet
            prepared for such a step. He, himself, is not so worried at such an apparent breach of
            the Hallstein Doctrine, although he admitted that it would be a great defeat if
            India—for example—should as a result establish relations with East Germany.</p>
                    <p>4. Kiesinger was pessimistic as to overall prospects for improvement of East-West
            relations. However, he thought the Germans must continue to try. Many changes will take
            place within the next 5–10 years which might be favorable to their cause. The Chancellor
            spoke of his conversation of the evening before with the Hannover industrialist Philipp
            von Bismarck, himself a refugee from East Germany. Bismarck had advised him that for the
            first time the refugee groups in Germany are taking Eastern policy seriously—and on a
            realistic basis. There are those who argue that the govt's Eastern policy involves risk,
            Kiesinger continued—that there will be no immediate success and that in the end the
            people will accuse the govt of having raised “illusions” and having ended up in a “dead
            end.” He fully supported the policy which he and <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> Brandt had developed, which was based on the desire to move forward
            but without expectation of immediate success. This policy, which had the official
            backing of the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_CSU1">CSU</gloss>,
            was not seriously contested within the party (this was confirmed by a group of <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> Parliamentarians at lunch-eon today, as is being reported
            separately).</p>
                    <p>5. I advised the Chancellor that we had followed the efforts of his govt in East-West
            relations closely, and that we had found nothing to take exception to. His policy was
            consistent with that of our own in attempting to build bridges to the East, although we
            were in the present circumstances handicapped in our own efforts. The Chancellor
            commented that he did not think there was much we could do under the circumstances. The
            Chancellor assured me that Germany would of course not undertake any action with the
            Sovs which affected the US without first consulting fully with us. I said that we
            appreciated this and that this was particularly important where US forces were involved
            such as proposals for mutual force reductions.</p>

                    <p>1. Department agrees with your assessment of French obstructionsim on Berlin and
            All-German matters. We also agree that we may have to move independently on important
            cases when we meet French intransigence, to the extent of acquainting <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> Foreign Office with our view. We think that from past
            experience in such cases we have, at least, demonstrated to the Germans where the
            obstacle lies.</p>
                    <p>2. We have some reservations, however, in agreeing with you that this be done by a

            between friendship with France and friendship with the United States, a danger which you

                    <p>1020. Secto 024. <gloss target="#t_NATUS1">NATUS</gloss>. Subject: <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Ministerial Meeting: Quadripartite dinner.</p>
                    <p>1. Brandt opened meeting by suggesting discussion of Soviet note to the Four,<note n="2" xml:id="d241fn2">Dated December 8; for text, see <hi rend="italic">Documents on
                Germany, 1944–1985</hi>, pp. 972–977.</note> and of the “inner” German situation
              (<gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> relations).
            On the Soviet note Brandt said he was not alarmed since the Soviets often operate at two
            levels. Thus when they fear attack from inside their own camp they build up a
            smoke-screen. He believed the note was connected with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s recent visit to Warsaw and <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
            Foreign Minister Winzer's visit to Belgrade, Soviets wanted to remove suspicion of
            Allies as to what was involved in Brandt/<persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName> talks. The note was also probably intended to influence attitude
            within the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>2. For his part, Brandt believed talks with Soviets should continue without publicity
            to see what they mean. Soviet note should not be left unanswered. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> will give Soviets a short reply rejecting allegation
            against his government, but will also pick up last part where the Soviets seem to offer
            openings for further talks. Brandt believed Soviet allegations should also be rejected
            as soon as possible by British, US and French. He said replies need not be
            identical.</p>
                    <p>3. The Secretary referred to press reports concerning heavy Soviet pressure to avoid
            reestablishment of Yugoslav/<gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> relations. He said we
            were prepared to reply briefly and offered to provide a draft for consideration. Foreign
            Minister <persName corresp="#p_BG4">Brown</persName> had no comment, but Mulley on
            British side agreed answer was called for. He wondered why Soviets sent note; he
            suggested usual coordination in Bonn would be best. <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> said he had not studied the Soviet communication nor had he
            discussed it. He did not know whether answer should be made or not. He agreed matter
            could be discussed in Bonn. Replies did not have to be identical since it is more
            difficult to get agreed text and we could spend weeks and weeks on that task. Secretary
            thought notes of Three Powers should be as close to identical as possible and prepared
            as promptly as possible. It was finally agreed question of sending response to Soviet
            statement would be coordinated in Ambassadorial Group in Bonn.</p>
                    <p>4. Brandt mentioned recent conference of <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> Chiefs of
            Mission from Eastern Europe. He said <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> was making some
            progress in the trade and cultural fields and some even in the political field. The next
            step is to resume relations with Yugoslavia. He pointed to the coincidence <pb n="613" xml:id="pg_613" facs="0643"/>of Soviet statements attacking the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and the establishment of relations with Romania earlier
            this year, the agreement on trade missions in Prague in the summer, and now when the
            Soviets know Yugoslavia may be next. He said that up to now Kiesinger had had problems
            with the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> on Yugoslavia, but now there will be no
            objection to negotiations. As a matter of fact, most of the problems have already been
            discussed informally.</p>
                    <p>5. Brandt said <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName> had originally insisted
            on renunciation of force agreement between <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and
              <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> as condition for progress in talks. Situation had
            changed at November 21 meeting. <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName> now
            foresees bilateral between <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> which would be open to other socialist states,
            including the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, on basis of equality of treatment.
              <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName> had also queried Brandt on Kiesinger
            statement that talks would not lead to much. Brandt reminded <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName> that Chancellor Kiesin-ger's second letter to <persName corresp="#p_SW6">Stoph</persName> had not been answered. In the letter, Kiesin-ger
            had offered renunciation of force to East Germans. Brandt agreed the conditions for each
            party to these agreements should be equal but that the circumstances of each might
            differ. According to Brandt, <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName> confirmed
            that it was not necessary for the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> to recognize the
              <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. In discussing framework of an agreement, the
            Soviets threw in every demand they have had against the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> except issue of <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> membership in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName> was
            specifically interested in assurances on inviolability of frontiers (<gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>), Oder-Neisse Line,
            Munich agreement, non-interference by the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> in West
            Berlin, renunciation of nuclears and suppression of Nazism.</p>
                    <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName> said: (A) The Potsdam Agreement is
            the basis for relations of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and Germany and the
            Three Powers; (B) Articles 53 and 57 of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter
            are still valid; (C) Referred to the <gloss target="#t_WEU1">WEU</gloss> of 1954 and the
            Settlement Convention.<note n="3" xml:id="d241fn3">For text, see ibid., pp.
              430–431.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>7. Brandt said the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> had not thoroughly studied the
            implications of the Soviet approach. Meanwhile <persName corresp="#p_DGF3">Duckwitz</persName> will feel out Soviet intentions shortly with <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName>. Brandt had impression that Soviets are now
            interested in a bilateral declaration. Once agreement is reached thereon it would be
            open to the other socialist states on an equal basis. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and Soviets are still far apart but Brandt saw renunciation of force as
            formula for bilateral exchange of views which would lead to reduction of tensions.</p>
                    <p>8. Brandt stressed that to be successful, discussions with <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName> must be held quietly but if there were new developments or
            information the Three Powers would be informed through their Bonn Ambassadors. Such
            information should be closely held.</p>
                    <p>9. Secretary asked whether anything was said by Soviets about special status of Berlin.
            Brandt replied question was not discussed but only <pb n="614" xml:id="pg_614" facs="0644"/>mentioned. Secretary asked for Brandt's reactions to points required by
              <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName> for a renunciation of force
            agreement. Brandt was of the opinion that renunciation of force was a heading, under
            which many issues would be considered.</p>
                    <p>10. There ensued an exchange between <persName corresp="#p_BG4">Brown</persName>,
            Brandt and <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> as to the meaning of a
            renunciation of force agreement, the main thrust of which, as summarized by <persName corresp="#p_BG4">Brown</persName>, was that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
            was being asked for a lot for the privilege of renouncing force.</p>
                    <p>11. Brandt, in response to the Secretary's question, confirmed that in his opinion the
            Soviets did not expect the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> to leave <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. After reviewing with Brandt the origin of the
              Brandt/<persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName> talks the Secretary expressed
            his concern that <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> efforts might lead to further
            Berlin problems. He recalled that if we had gone all the way on accepting existing
            frontiers, etc. in 1958–62 we might not have had a Berlin crisis. The Secretary was
            especially concerned lest anything happen that would cause another crisis in Berlin. He
            said we certainly cannot say no to these talks but we should know where we are going. He
            recalled that when the question of reopening the reunification question arose two or
            three years ago the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> was unwilling to talk about the
            somewhat unpleasant things that go with it. He wanted to be sure that the Four would be
            there together if trouble occurred. It was inevitable that unpleasant issues would
            arise. It was possible the Soviets wanted to improve relations but the case to date is
            not persuasive. On the other hand they may be returning to the issue of Berlin and
            insist on changes in the status of the city. To Brandt's query as to whether he had any
            evidence of such an oncoming crisis, the Secretary replied in the negative.</p>
                    <p>12. The Secretary said that if the frontiers of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
            were frozen and renunciation of force agreement was signed, reunification might be
            considered finished. In reply, Brandt sought to reassure the Secretary that little new
            was being done, indicating <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> had already undertaken
            not to use force, and that he would not sacrifice the interests of Berlin.</p>
                    <p>13. <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> felt that except for (1) boundary
            between East and West Germany; (2) Oder-Neisse Line; (3) Berlin's special status and (4)
            nuclear weapons the Three Powers had no concerns. The boundary and Oder-Neisse questions
            were not important and the nuclear issue is not relevant for the Three Powers. He was
            skeptical on outcome of the negotiations but believed them to be a good thing even if
            they led to nothing concrete.</p>
                    <p>14. Brandt gave assurances on protecting Allied prerogatives, pointing to <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> refusal to negotiate with the Soviets for Aeroflot use of
            the Berlin corridors.</p>
                    <p>15. <persName corresp="#p_BG4">Brown</persName> wondered whether you can protect the
            Berlin situation if you comply with Soviet demands. Brandt replied that he was not
            speaking of what the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> would do but what the Soviets
            would want. The question is, would the Allies trust him to do what they had already
            done. <pb n="615" xml:id="pg_615" facs="0645"/>He was not asking for permission but
            informing them and asking for their confidence.</p>
                    <p>16. The Secretary said there was no problem of giving our confidence but a problem of
            transferring to the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> in the dark the rights of the
            US. We must stay very close when Allied rights are involved. He found the Soviet
            approach of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> somewhat objectionable. Should not
            the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> consider some points on its side which should be
            involved in a renunciation of force agreement? If the Soviets really take seriously a
            renunciation of force, Soviet forces could go home and there could be a normal movement
            of people.</p>
                    <p>17. <persName corresp="#p_BG4">Brown</persName> wondered whether a mutual renunciation
            of force agreement could not be widened out in such a way as to help with the British
              <gloss target="#t_BAOR1">BAOR</gloss> offset problem. Brandt said the mutual
            withdrawal of troops was another problem and a time may come to take it up in the
            future. He considered his renunciation of force agreement similar to <persName corresp="#p_BG4">Brown</persName>'s friendship treaty. <persName corresp="#p_BG4">Brown</persName> said that the friendship treaty and other proposed arrangements were
            dead and he wondered why the Soviets were switching their attentions to the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_BG4">Brown</persName> said the
            Soviets were picking a fight on every front. He referred to difficulties with them over
            the Brooke case,<note n="4" xml:id="d241fn4">Reference is to the 1965 sentencing of
              British citizen Gerald Brooke to 5 years in prison for “anti-Soviet activities.”
                <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> brought up the issue without a
              successful resolution during his January 22–24 visit to the Soviet Union.</note> and
            mentioned particularly fact that <gloss target="#t_KGB1">KGB</gloss> had increased its
            activity in the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>18. At the end of the pre-dinner session, it was generally agreed that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> would go ahead with talks with the Soviets, but would
            proceed carefully and keep the Three Powers informed when their interests were
            involved.</p>
                    <p>19. Governing Mayor Schuetz joined the Foreign Ministers at dinner and made a report on
            the situation in Berlin. He said things were not so bad as some people thought. The
            student situation was better and he had been talking to West German businessmen, British
            businessmen and French businessmen to get them interested in the city. He would also be
            talking to American businessmen. He saw no signs of an oncoming crisis of any kind in
            the city. He was pessimistic on passes for this year but hopeful for 1968.</p>
                    <p>20. At the conclusion of the meeting the decision was made to issue no statement or
            declaration. Agreement was, however, reached on a common statement to be used for press
            background briefing, which being repeated separately.</p>

              Kiesinger—<gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>. I called on Chancellor Kiesinger
            yesterday evening for a final tour d'horizon prior to my departure later in the week for
            Washington. Several subjects were discussed.<note n="2" xml:id="d242fn2">

              conversation with Kiesinger in telegram 6496 from Bonn, December 20. (Ibid.)</note>
            The following concerns <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>1. The Chancellor said that he greatly appreciated the President's “friendly” letter of
            Dec. 11,<note n="3" xml:id="d242fn3">For text, see <ref target="frus1964-68v11#d222">
                                <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1964–1968, vol. XI, Document
              222</ref>.</note> in response to his own letter of Dec. 8,<note n="4" xml:id="d242fn4">Not printed. (Johnson Library, National Security File, Special Head of States
              Correspondence, Germany)</note> and the assurance that the President had given him
            regarding the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>. He was concerned, however, about one
            sentence to the effect that the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> must not hamper the
            free flow of nuclear materials “between nations who enter into the treaty and carry out
            its obligations in good faith.” Since it was a fundamental German aim to preserve the
            European Community through <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss>, he hoped that
            this did not mean that France would, as a non-signatory, be excluded. I told the
            Chancellor that I was confident that the President's statement had not been intended to
            exclude France, which as a nuclear power would have a special position under the treaty.
            I pointed out, however, that the Swedish draft and, indeed, an earlier German draft, had
            language which would have excluded even the nuclear powers from nuclear imports—if they
            did not submit to <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> inspection. We would not desire
            to interrupt supplies to France under our present <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> arrangements. We would, however, not be willing to revert to a purely
            bilateral arrangement with France.</p>
                    <p>2. The Chancellor expressed another concern about <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>.
            He quoted from a statement that Amb <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> had
            made in Geneva on Dec. 15 to the effect that the best way to overcome the present
            impasse on Article III was perhaps to negotiate with the Soviets in the same way that we
            had successfully negotiated Articles I and II.<note n="5" xml:id="d242fn5">For text of
              the U.S. proposal, see <ref target="frus1964-68v11#d216">
                                <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1964–1968, vol. XI, Document
              216</ref>.</note> The Chancellor reminded me that the principal German concern over
            the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> in the early days derived from the fact that we
            had negotiated Articles I and II before consulting Germany and our other Allies. He
            hoped that this was not what <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> had in mind.
            I stated that I felt sure it was not. I quoted from the <pb n="617" xml:id="pg_617" facs="0647"/>results of <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName>'s last meeting
            with Roshchin on Dec. 15, in which he had expressed to Roshchin the firm view that
            Article III could be based on nothing less than the US draft of Nov. 2—which the
            Chancellor knew had been supported by our Allies in the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> meeting of Dec. 6. It was my understanding that, in comparing Article III
            with Articles I and II, <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> merely argued
            that, in Article III, we should deal with “the heart of the matter” and “avoid
            politically unacceptable labels” (such as <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>
            safeguards), and had no intention to imply that we should not continue close
            consulations with our Allies.</p>
                    <p>3. The Chancellor, who apparently had heard of our adverse reaction to the German
            aide-memoire of Nov. 20,<note n="6" xml:id="d242fn6">Not found.</note> said that he
            wanted to be very clear that the Germans would not make proposals with respect to the
              <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> for purely tactical reasons. It was far too
            serious a matter. He seemed to be admitting that this had been done in the past and
            apologizing for it. The German <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> proposals had,
            through the intervention of technicians, often been uncoordinated and misleading. In
            response to my query, he confirmed that he considered that his own letter to the
            President of Dec. 8 superseded the aide-memoire. Germany was now concerned only with the
            issues of (A) verification, (B) preservation of the European nuclear community, (C)
            duration and (D) security from nuclear blackmail. I advised the Chancellor of the
            additional results of the <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> and Roshchin
            meeting Dec. 15 on the question of safeguards, duration and security issues.</p>

                    <p>Dear Al:</p>
                    <p>I am giving you below a brief account of the conversations which Professor <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Henry Kissinger</persName> had here during a brief stay.
              <persName>Henry</persName> asked me <pb n="618" xml:id="pg_618" facs="0648"/>to send a
            copy to Ben Read with whom he will discuss the matter further and requested that this
            account be closely held.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Henry</persName> was here on January 9 and left at noon on January 10. He said
            that during this period he saw, at his request, Finance Minister <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName>, All-German Affairs Minister <persName corresp="#p_WH6">Wehner</persName>, Parliamentary State Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GKTF1">Guttenberg</persName>, and, at their request, Chancellor
            Kiesinger and Defense Minister Schroeder. Chancellor Kiesinger left the Cabinet meeting
            on January 10 for 3/4 of an hour in order to see <persName>Henry</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_GKTF1">Guttenberg</persName>, whom <persName>Henry</persName> had seen
            earlier separately, was present during the meeting with Chancellor Kiesinger.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that both <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GKTF1">Guttenberg</persName> remained adamantly opposed to an <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> in any form. <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> said that he
            had once written to the Chancellor that he would resign from the Cabinet if an <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> was signed and that he continued to adhere to this
            position. If it came to that, there would then be the beginnings of a conservative
            party. Strauss observed that the opponents of the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>
            and conservative elements in general were simply waiting for the moment when a
            nationally known figure would take the lead.</p>
                    <p>Barring such a development, <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> said that he
            would adhere to his tactics of remaining silent on issues outside of his direct field of
            responsibility. He said he was frequently being chided by his adherents for maintaining
            silence but he was convinced that these tactics were sound. He observed that given
            Chancellor Kiesinger's age and temperament the question of succession would eventually
            arise. It was clear that <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> believed that by
            remaining silent his chances to become Kiesinger's eventual successor would improve.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that Chancellor Kiesinger was
            more cautious on the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>. He stressed that German views
            must be taken fully into account and that he would have to see the full text of the
            treaty before he could reach a final decision. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> reported his impression during his talks in Moscow that the
            Soviets appeared interested in signing an <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> and were
            hinting at the possibility of a compromise. Since he had not been there in any official
            capacity it was difficult to evaluate the significance of these hints. Chancellor
            Kiesinger appeared to be somewhat concerned by this and emphasized again the need for
            German views to be taken fully into account.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_WH6">Wehner</persName> was the only minister with whom he had talked who
            had been positive with regard to the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Europe.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> made it clear that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> would not undertake any cooperation with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and the other five that would antagonize the French. <pb n="619" xml:id="pg_619" facs="0649"/>He said this was also the Chancellor's position.
            Chancellor Kiesinger later confirmed this.</p>
                    <p>Both the Chancellor and <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> said that in the
            next round of discussions with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> in
            February an attempt would be made to explore whether progress on greater European
            political unity could be made, presumably along the lines of the Fouchet plan. <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> will accompany the Chancellor on this trip.</p>
                    <p>Schroeder, on the other hand, continued to be in favor of a tough line toward the
            French and cooperation between the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and the other five.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Offset.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> said that “not a cent” could come from
            the budget. On the other hand, it would be possible to make arrangements through the
            Bundesbank for the purchase of about 1 billion worth of medium, preferably short term,
            but under no circumstances long term bonds. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> was not sure whether Strauss, when mentioning the 1 billion
            figure, was talking in terms of dollars or DM, but he believed it was the latter.</p>
                    <p>Schroeder said that regrettably no funds could come out of the defense budget. The
            situation had been easier when the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> was still making
            massive arms purchases but this was now no longer feasible.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>The Chancellor told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> that Foreign
            Minister Brandt had written to the Secretary about the recent <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> statement on Vietnam.<note n="2" xml:id="d243fn2">Not found.</note> The
            Chancellor said that he would be writing separately to the President, assuring him that
            the Federal Government had no intention of criticizing, or interfering with, US actions
            in this area and that the Government's position remained as he had outlined it in his
            press conference after his return from his Washington visit. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that it was erroneous to believe that a
            premature US withdrawal from Vietnam would lead to an increased US presence in Europe;
            the same forces which were advocating a withdrawal from Vietnam were also in favor of a
            reduced US role in Europe. The Chancellor took note of this.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_WH6">Wehner</persName> expressed a certain degree of impatience
            with the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> statement on Vietnam which he considered
            the result of short-sighted local politics.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Miscellaneous Observations.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that he was struck by
            Chancellor Kiesinger's repeated references to German independence. The Chancellor had
            said at one point that he understood his role to be to “protect German interests <pb n="620" xml:id="pg_620" facs="0650"/>rather than to execute Atlantic policies.” The
            Chancellor apparently made this remark when discussing attempts to turn <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> into an instrument for détente about which be showed
            some irritation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that the
            Chancellor showed much interest in <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>s and wondered why
            Germany could not have such a system.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that Schroeder looked
            physically fit. It was obvious from Schroeder's remarks that he was strongly opposed to
            the Grand Coalition and the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss>, to whom he always
            referred to as “The Left.”</p>
                    <p>I think it was of particular interest that <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> continues to adhere to the position that he will break with the
            Chancellor if the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> is signed. The Chancellor is
            looking for a broad consensus within the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_CSU1">CSU</gloss> on this issue and would, I believe, not let it come to a
            break with Strauss over the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> unless there were
            massive counter pressure from the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> which cannot be
            taken for granted.</p>
                    <p>With all best wishes.</p>

                    <p>After an exchange of amenities, the Secretary raised the question of current Soviet
            interest in the status of Berlin.</p>
                    <p>Schuetz said he believed the Soviets were not really interested in changing the status
            of Berlin. They looked at <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> and his efforts
            to get a new constitution which might want to do away with the vestiges of World War II.
            There were other possible explanations of current Soviet interest in Berlin. Schuetz saw
            a fear on the part of the Soviets that Schuetz' coming to Berlin, keeping in mind his
            past job in the Bonn government, signified an effort by the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> to change the status of Berlin. In other words, in Soviet minds there was
            concern that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> was introducing new salami tactics
            in changing the status of Berlin. He saw in the Soviet Memorandum<note n="2" xml:id="d244fn2">For text of the January 29 Soviet note, see <hi rend="italic">Documents on Germany, 1944–1985</hi>, pp. 984–986.</note> a warning rather than a
            new policy. He anticipated no crisis in Berlin. The Mayor asked if there was any
            evidence available to the Secretary pointing to a possible crisis over Berlin.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said there was nothing of substance. Our Watch Committee had found no
            indicators. The Secretary could imagine that seen through the eyes of a Russian General,
            Berlin might appear to be a tempting and vulnerable object. He reminded the Mayor that
            he had pointed out to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> in 1961 that Berlin
            was no more vulnerable than New York because of our presence there.<note n="3" xml:id="d244fn3">Reference is presumably to 1961 discussions in New York; memoranda of
              their conversations are in <ref target="frus1961-63v14">

              439–441, and 456–461.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Schuetz agreed, and added that while there appeared to be no evidence for any crisis,
            one would have to be watchful.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked how the Mayor interpreted the Soviet action in addressing
            themselves to the Germans alone on the question of Berlin.</p>
                    <p>Schuetz said this was puzzling since the Soviets must know that the Germans would
            inform the Americans as well as the British and French. He mentioned in this connection
            that <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> had spoken to him recently of
            international obligations regarding Berlin which could only mean all of Berlin.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary referred to remarks he made to Foreign Minister Brandt in Brussels<note n="4" xml:id="d244fn4">Reported in telegram Secto 16 from Brussels, December 13.
              (Department of State, Conference Files: Lot 67 D 586, CF 242)</note> on this subject
            which had been interpreted as being rather negative. He assured Schuetz that he did not
            mean to be negative, but that out of his first 1–1/2 years of experience as Secretary of
            State with a Berlin crisis he only wanted to warn his colleague of the explosive nature
            of this problem. He said it was extremely important that all, the three Western Powers,
            as well as Bonn and Berlin stay very close on this.</p>
                    <p>Schuetz agreed that this was necessary and that as far as Berlin was concerned he would
            make sure that this was done.</p>

                    <p>8270. Subject: Rostow meeting with the Chancellor.</p>
                    <p>1. During Under Secretary Rostow's meeting this afternoon with Chancellor Kiesinger,
            the Chancellor was primarily interested in providing information and views concerning
            German Eastern policy, the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>, relations with France,
            and the state of his coalition government. These are reported in this telegram. The
            Chancellor requested that his remarks be transmitted to the Secretary and to the
            President. The portion of the conversation devoted to the US balance of payments problem
            is reported by septel.<note n="2" xml:id="d245fn2">The Embassy reported on the portion
              of the talk dealing with balance-of-payments issues in telegram 8265 from Bonn,
              February 12. (Ibid.)</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>1. [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] Eastern policy—The Chancellor said that the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> is currently having serious internal trouble. The party
            membership feels increasingly that they are going to lose the next election. The
              <persName corresp="#p_WH6">Wehner</persName> school of responsible and constructive
            participation in the grand coalition has lost out. Real divergencies within the party
            have developed particularly on the subject of Eastern policy. The Chancellor said that
            he had talked directly to Brandt, <persName corresp="#p_WH6">Wehner</persName>, and
            Helmut Schmidt and all three agreed that it would be highly dangerous for the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> to talk directly with the Sovs concerning Berlin. There
            is, however, a strong group in the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> that feels
            otherwise. The Chancellor expected that within the coalition it will be necessary to
            “have it out” with the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> on Eastern policy in general
            and that this will be done over the next two weeks. Under Secretary Rostow assured the
            Chancellor of US support for German efforts to improve understanding with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and with the Eastern European countries. He said that
            we are quite willing to see the German side go ahead with talks with the Soviets as
            initiated by Brandt and <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName>. Rostow made
            clear that we are now quite satisfied that there is no difference of view between US and
            the Federal Govt on the handling of the Sov memorandum concerning Berlin. The
            Chancellor, while making clear that real trouble was to be expected in the coalition
            concerning Eastern policy, stressed that he did not wish us to think that it would cause
            a real coalition crisis.</p>
                    <p>2. <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>—Still in the context of differences between the
              <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_CSU1">CSU</gloss>, the Chancellor turned to the subject of <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>. He said that the treaty still presents problems. Rostow
            commented in this connection that it was a good letter which Brandt had just sent to the
            Secretary on the subject.<note n="3" xml:id="d245fn3">Dated February 9; the letter was
              transmitted to the Embassy in Bonn in telegram 113607, February 10. (Department of

                        <pb n="623" xml:id="pg_623" facs="0653"/>The Chancellor, after consulting with the
            interpreter said that he thought the letter was “a little softly formulated.” He
            suggested that this latest letter should be read in the context of Brandt's earlier
            letter to the Secretary concerning the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>.<note n="4" xml:id="d245fn4">Apparent reference to Brandt's letter of Oct 13. A copy is in Johnson
              Library, National Security File, Country File, Germany, vol. 14.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>3. Relations with France—The Chancellor said that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName> obviously poses a very serious problem for him. He had heard that
            concern may exist in the US about the possibility of some secret understanding between
            France and Germany. The Chancellor could assure us that this was not the case. He noted
            that a recent public opinion poll showed that 75 percent of the Germans consider the
            German alliance with the United States as the most important element of German foreign
            policy. The Chancellor said that he has explained to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName> in the past and will do so again that by pursuing a strong
            anti-American line <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> is only antagonizing
            German opinion against France. The Chancellor added that it is nevertheless of the
            utmost importance for a positive German-French relationship to be preserved. If new
            antagonism again arises after this “second effort” to overcome it (the Chancellor was
            presumably referring to <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>'s efforts and his
            own) this would be a most grave development for the two countries and for Europe.
            Kiesinger thought that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> too understood
            this point. On the question of <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> entry, the Chancellor repeated his well-known views that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> could not be forced to change his opinion.
            Under Secretary Rostow told the Chancellor that the United States fully understood the
            importance of the French-German relationship. He said that the last thing which we
            wanted was to force Germany into any kind of choice between Paris and Washington. This
            telegram was not cleared with the Under Secretary.</p>

                    <p>956. Subj: <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName>'s February 13 letter to
            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName>. Ref: Berlin 951.<note n="2" xml:id="d246fn2">Telegram 951 from Berlin, February 15, transmitted the text of the

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Begin summary.</p>
                    <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName>'s letters to the US and British
            Ambassadors are virtually identical. The French were sent a copy of the letter to
            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> with a brief accompanying
            letter. This stated the Soviets and French have an interest in relaxation of tension,
            France has responsibilities in West Berlin, and that letters have been sent to British
            and US Ambassadors about Bonn's “illegal activities” in West Berlin.</p>
                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName>'s letter is similar in many
            respects to the Soviet January 6 memorandum, but contains noteworthy differences. The
            letter contains no implication that if Bonn continues its “illegal activities” in West
            Berlin the Soviet Union will find it necessary to take measures to protect its rights,
            as did the memorandum. In making the letter public, the Soviets are on record regarding
            any steps they might plan to take in connection with the March Bundestag committee
            meetings. The letter carefully avoids mention of these meetings and any specific
            threats.</p>
                    <p>3. The Mission concurs in Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName>'s
              view<note n="3" xml:id="d246fn3">Telegram 8431 from Bonn, February 15. (Department of

                    <p>4. Although Khrustalev told us yesterday, in response to question, that as far as he
            knew the Soviets did not intend “at this time” to publish the letter, the East German
            press carries on February 14 the text of the letter to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> (Berlin 951). The East German press makes no
            mention of letters being sent to the British and French Ambassadors. The British here
            received a letter the text of which is identical to ours.</p>
                    <pb n="625" xml:id="pg_625" facs="0655"/>
                    <p>5. The French were handed a copy of <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName>'s
            letter to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName>, with a brief
            accompanying letter from <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName>. The letter
            notes the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and France have a great interest in
            relaxation of tensions in Europe. It adds that France also has responsibilities for the
            establishment of a normal situation in West Berlin. In this connection, <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> states he has sent letters to the US and
            British Ambassadors on the subject of Bonn's illegal activities in West Berlin which
            create tension in Central Europe.</p>
                    <p>6. While the text of <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName>'s letter to
            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> is in many respects similar to
            the January 6 Soviet memorandum to the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> Government,
            there are noteworthy differences. The letter lists many of the same “illegal activities”
            of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> in West Berlin as the memorandum. However, it
            makes no reference to the recruitment of West Berlin youth for service in the German
            armed forces, and to the holding of a Bundestag Defense Committee meeting in West
            Berlin. The letter asserts that Bonn is attempting to change the status of West Berlin
            in its favor, and that this is a “highly risky course.” The memorandum contains no such
            statement. It warns instead that Moscow will not tolerate the incorporation of West
            Berlin into the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, and that if Bonn holds to its
            course of conducting “illegal activities” in West Berlin, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will find it necessary to take measures to protect its rights and
            interests.</p>
                    <p>7. It seems likely that <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName>, in his desire
            to meet with one or more of the Western Ambassadors in West Berlin in the second half of
            February (Berlin 917),<note n="4" xml:id="d246fn4">Dated February 4. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> US–<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>)</note> would
            have raised <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> activities in West Berlin as his major
            topic. His letter presumably is intended to take the place of such meetings. In
            releasing the letter to the East Germans for publication, the Soviets have now put
            themselves on record for any steps they might plan to take in connection with the March
            4–8 Bundestag committee meetings in West Berlin. It is to be noted, however, that the
            letter carefully avoids both mention of these forthcoming meetings and any specific
            threats. Its contents and fact that it was immediately published suggest that the
            Soviets have sent the letter primarily for propaganda purposes.</p>
                    <p>8. In view of the fact that the Soviets have addressed similar letters to the British
            and US, we believe it would be preferable to coordinate any possible reply. The Mission
            concurs in Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName>'s view, expressed
            here, that any reply should be brief and reaffirm our concept about Allied rights and
            responsibilities in Berlin, as well as those responsibilities which have been assigned
            to the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. Without attempting to justify <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> activities about which the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has complained, our reply should indicate also that we keep a careful
            watch on activities here from the standpoint of their consistency with the legal status
            of the city. We believe <pb n="626" xml:id="pg_626" facs="0656"/>any reply should draw
            attention also to the degree to which the Soviets have permitted the incorporation of
            East Berlin into East Germany in violation of post-war agreements with respect to
            Berlin. One example would be East German claims that East Berlin is the capital of the
              <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>9. The separate treatment accorded the French is a reflection of current Soviet policy
            toward France. We would hope that the French will agree to identical Ambassadorial
            replies or, failing this, coordinated replies. We hope we can avoid a situation in which
            the French follow the same procedure used by the Soviets.</p>

            Subj: Ambassador's call on <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> Brandt. I called on
              <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> Brandt today at my request. It was my first
            opportunity to see him—or for that matter any high official—since the German-French
            meeting in Paris on Feb. 15 and 16. Brandt departs on Feb. 22 for a four-day visit to
            Morocco. The following subjects were discussed. <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> entry
            will be the subject of a septel.<note n="2" xml:id="d247fn2">Telegram 8569 from Bonn,

                    </p>
                    <p>1. US balance of payments and offset—I reviewed briefly the presentations made by Under
            Secretaries Rostow and Deming and Amb Trezise during their recent visits on the US
            balance of payments and offset problems. I stressed the importance that the US Govt
            attaches to the success of the President's program, announced Jan 1,<note n="3" xml:id="d247fn3">For text of President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s announcement, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the
                Presidents of the United States: <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B.
                  Johnson</persName>
                            </hi>, 1968, Book I, pp. 8–13.</note> to redress our adverse payments balance. We were
            considering in this connection a number of measures in the general area of border tax
            adjustments. It is our sincere desire that this be accomplished without restriction of
            trade, however, our ability <pb n="627" xml:id="pg_627" facs="0657"/>to do so and at the
            same time to stave off the protectionist measures proposed in our Congress will depend
            in large degree on the assistance given us by our trading partners. In particular it is
            our hope that the surplus countries, including Germany, will as agreed in the OECD take
            appropriate measures to increase imports and encourage the flow of long-term investment
            capital abroad.</p>
                    <p>In connection with the offset, I expressed appreciation for the reception accorded our
            reps. The meetings in Bonn had revealed no serious difference of views between us on
            this issue, and Under Secretaries Rostow and Deming had been well received by Pres.
            Blessing of the Bundesbank. We had made clear that our objective during fiscal 68/69,
            which can be achieved largely through purchase of medium-term securities, is a full
            neutralization of our foreign exchange losses resulting from our forces in Germany—$775
            million. Although the final negotiation, which lay ahead, would be between the
            Bundesbank and the US Treasury, I hoped that the German Govt would support our
            objectives with the Bundesbank in whatever way was appropriate.</p>
                    <p>In response, Brandt said that the Chancellor himself had, in their recent meeting,
            raised with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> the possible acceleration
            of the <persName>Kennedy Round</persName> tariff concessions. However, the French
            reaction was totally negative. French <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DM4">Debre</persName> had advised <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName> that such action would be “illegal”. German <gloss target="#t_EconMin1">EconMin</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SK6">Schiller</persName> had difficult discussions on this
            point, to no avail, with his French opposite members.</p>
                    <p>2. East/West issues—I told Brandt that we are concerned by allegations recently made in
            the press of American misgivings over German Eastern policy. I assured him that this was
            not the case. We had stressed the importance we continued to attach to Four-Power
            responsibility in Berlin—and the risks of any bilateral Soviet-German negotiations on
            Berlin. However, Brandt had himself assured us quite adequately on this point. Apart
            from this issue we welcomed direct discussions between the Germans and the Soviets on
            issues outstanding between them, as well as continued German efforts to improve
            relations with the <gloss target="#t_EE1">EE</gloss> countries and the recent
            establishment of relations with Yugoslavia. We had every confidence that the Germans
            would continue to keep us advised of their discussions with the Soviets and would
            consult with us in connection with any matter involving Allied interests. I pointed out
            that I had in my contacts with German officials detected some uncertainty resulting from
            the article by Zbigniew Brzezinski, former member of the Dept's Planning Council, in the
            January Foreign Affairs.<note n="4" xml:id="d247fn4">“The Framework of East-West
              Reconciliation,” <hi rend="italic">Foreign Affairs</hi>, January 1968, pp.
              256–275.</note> I assured Brandt that this article did not reflect State Dept policy
            and that Brzezinski was no longer associated with the Dept.</p>
                    <pb n="628" xml:id="pg_628" facs="0658"/>
                    <p>Brandt expressed appreciation for the assurance given him on the American attitude
            toward German <gloss target="#t_EW1">E/W</gloss> policy. I asked Brandt what new moves
            he contemplated in the <gloss target="#t_EW1">E/W</gloss> arena, in particular what
            answer the German Govt proposed to make to the Soviet memo of Jan. 29 on mutual force
            reduction. He said that there is a draft reply to the Sov note with the Chancellor. They
            hope to discuss it in the Cabinet meeting tomorrow, after which they will contact the
            three Allied Ambassadors. In discussing the content of the reply, Brandt said that there
            was a view within the German Govt that they should in effect say: “Since there are so
            many issues on which we do not agree, we must exchange mutual renunciations of force in
            order to avoid conflict.” His own view and that of the FonOff is more to the effect
            that: “Because we disagree we must discuss the areas of our disagreement with a view to
            reaching some solution—not necessarily in the short-term but in the long-term.”</p>
                    <p>The Germans should, in his view, give the Sovs a complete and lengthy document giving
            reasonable German positions on all Eastern subjects. (Not, however, necessarily at the
            time of the German response to the Jan. 29 Sov memo.) There was always a danger that the
            Sovs might publish, with a view to making propaganda, their own interpretation of their
            exchanges with the Germans on <gloss target="#t_EW1">E/W</gloss> issues. If the Germans
            had presented them a paper giving reasonable positions, they would in this event be
            protected. The paper, moreover, could provide a basis for further exchanges of
            views.</p>
                    <p>Brandt pointed out that he considered it significant that Sov Amb <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName> had in their talks never made it a condition
            for mutual force renunciation that all of the issues raised by the Sovs in their note be
            first resolved in their favor. Brandt thought that there was an opportunity for progress
            which could, even in the absence of an over-all agreement, reduce the potential danger
            of existing differences. For example, he thought it possible that the Germans might be
            able to tell the Poles they would accept the present western Polish border, until the
            matter could be considered in connection with a peace treaty. I informed Brandt that
            such an approach certainly seemed to be in the right direction.</p>
                    <p>3. Berlin—I reminded Brandt that, in addition to the note they had received from the
            Sovs on Berlin on January 6, the three Allies had also received notes on Feb. 16.<note n="5" xml:id="d247fn5">The January 6 Soviet note is summarized in The <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi>, January 17, 1968. For text of the February 14
              note handed to the United States, see <hi rend="italic">Documents on Germany,
                1944–1985</hi>, pp. 986–988.</note> The French note, however, was quite different
            from that given the Brit and ourselves. Indeed, the Sovs appeared to consider the French
            to be on their side. I hoped that Brandt would help urge the French to join with the
            Brit and ourselves in making a reply along orthodox lines, otherwise there would be a
            considerable strain on the excellent Three-Power solidarity which has existed in
            Berlin.</p>
                    <pb n="629" xml:id="pg_629" facs="0659"/>
                    <p>Brandt advised that the draft <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> reply to the Sov
            memorandum on Berlin was now before the All-German Affairs Committee of the Cabinet.
            Approval was expected tomorrow, and the text would be shown to the three Allies
            immediately. Brandt hoped that we could give our reaction quickly, since he considered
            it important to get the reply to the Sovs before the Bundestag committees begin their
            Berlin meetings on March 4.<note n="6" xml:id="d247fn6">For text of the March 1 German
              note, see ibid., pp. 988–989.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>I asked Brandt if a final decision had been made as to whether the Defense Committee
            would meet in Berlin. He raised his hands in obvious disapproval. He had raised this
            issue with Bundestag Pres Ger-stenmeier and found that the decision that it would meet
            had already been made. The committee would, however, meet only during the day and would
            not discuss military matters, which would be reserved until they returned to Bonn. He
            did not like this decision and assured me that this would not happen again. I pointed
            out that, although we had not advised the Germans not to have the meeting since we as
            well as they would not wish to appear to be backtracking in the face of Sov threats, I
            thought his own attitude toward the matter was a wise one.</p>
                    <p>4. <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>—I referred to the Sec of State's letter to
            Brandt of Feb 17 on the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>,<note n="7" xml:id="d247fn7">Transmitted in telegram 116563 to Bonn, February 16. (Department of State, Central
              Files, DEF 18–6)</note> which had been in response to his own letter of Feb 9. Did he
            feel that this letter was sufficiently responsible. I also asked what if anything the
            French had said about <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> in their recent meeting in
            Paris. What were the next moves the Germans proposed to make on the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>? Brandt replied that he considered the Secretary's letter
            to be quite positive. They themselves had favored the Swedish proposal to which the
            Secretary's letter referred. His inclination is not to answer the Secretary's letter
            although State Sec <persName corresp="#p_DGF3">Duckwitz</persName> will raise the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> issue when he is in Washington next week. Some of his
            assistants in the <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> are in favor of forwarding a
            paper to the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> with the full German position on
              <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>. He is aware, of course, that any such paper will
            probably be included with the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> report made to the
              <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. He would, therefore, like to show it to us first.
            State Sec <persName corresp="#p_DGF3">Duckwitz</persName> will bring it with him to
            Washington, and they would appreciate any suggestions we might have.</p>
                    <p>The German side had raised the nuclear issue with the French during the recent meetings
            only in connection with <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss>. French <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> had (not to Brandt but to someone else a

            (reported Bonn 7612).<note n="8" xml:id="d247fn8">Not found.</note> Brandt appealed to
            the French to “agree or at least to acquiesce” in <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> to discussions between <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> and
              <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> on verification. <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve</persName> had made no comment other than to say <pb n="630" xml:id="pg_630" facs="0660"/>that, “he saw the problem.” The Quai Political Director
              <persName corresp="#p_BJ8">Beaumarchais</persName> had said, however (in a separate
            conversation with FonOff Asst Sec <persName corresp="#p_RHH1">Ruete</persName>) that
            although the French would not support such a move he presumed they would “let it
            go”.</p>
                    <p>I advised Brandt of the contents of the first para of Moscow's 2843<note n="9" xml:id="d247fn9">Dated February 19. (Ibid., TP 7 <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>)</note> regarding Sovs consultations on <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>. Brandt indicated, however, that he was already informed.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Barzel: We have the impression the other side is marshaling all their forces in one
            concerted offensive all over Vietnam and should have little left to strike with when
            this is over. Is that how you see it ?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rostow: Yes, the war has entered a climactic period. We have experienced the first
            wave of that offensive. Though it brought a great deal of human suffering, it has failed
            in its objective to bring down the South Vietnamese government and its army and to leave
            the U. S. alone to defend the country. The enemy has yet to commit one-half of its
            forces and may employ them to force a major battle in the Khe Sanh-Quang Tri area and
            perhaps at Saigon. This may well put the war into its decisive phase.</p>

            declaration in which he stressed Germany's gratitude to the U. S. for its valiant
            defense of good causes around the world. He denounced anti-American sentiments as
            “stupid.” Germany and others had much to be thankful for to the United States. German

                    <p>He sent Prince Botho (himself an M.D.) to Vietnam to check on the performance of the
            German assistance program there. I myself have sent telegrams to our people in Vietnam,
            voicing appreciation for their efforts there and urging them to stay on at this
            difficult time.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> has told Chancellor Kiesinger

            out of the discussion. The Chancellor was happy about that suggestion and would like to
            take advantage of it from time to time.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Mr. Rostow: I have not seen it yet.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Barzel: Let me try to summarize the five major points from my notes. As you know,
            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> had urged Mr. Kiesinger to play the
            role of “harmonizer.” This is what he is trying to do.</p>
                    <p>(1) With regard to Britain's entry into the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>,
            Kiesinger was able to move only a small step further, but it was a step in the right
            direction.</p>
                    <p>(2) On <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName> said, as matters were standing now, he felt he could say that France
            will remain in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>(3) In the area of the dollar discussions, Mr. Kiesinger is trying to get the
              <persName>Kennedy Round</persName> moved up. This is our policy now. I don't know how
            you feel about it.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rostow: We are in favor of it. It would provide us some compensation for the losses
            we have taken from the “harmonization” of the border taxes which, in effect, represented
            a devaluation of the mark vis-à-vis the dollar.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Barzel:</p>
                    <p>(4) <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> said this twice to Kiesinger and
            with emphasis: He (<persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>) had reason to
            believe that if the U. S. should resort to tactical nuclear weapons in Vietnam, the U.S.
            could expect that an atomic bomb of unknown origin would hit a city in the United
            States.</p>
                    <pb n="632" xml:id="pg_632" facs="0662"/>
                    <p>(5) On German policy towards the U. S., de Gaulle said, he would make no move to oppose
            it and would not put pressures on the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> in this regard
            at this time.</p>
                    <p>You see, the Chancellor is doing his best to play the part of the harmonizer.</p>
                    <p>As you know, we had a huge pro-American demonstration in Berlin this week in response
            to a demonstration against the U. S. Vietnam policy there earlier. 150,000 people
            demonstrated their goodwill for the United States.</p>
                    <p>I had a meeting with Mr. Kiesinger on February 16, and he asked me to relay the
            following thoughts to you:</p>
                    <p>There could be a political crisis coming on in Germany if the following four matters
            should become acute at the same time:</p>
                    <p>1. the offset and dollar question</p>
                    <p>2. the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>
                    </p>
                    <p>3. the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> move to forbid legal time-limits on
            persecution for genocide and mass murder</p>
                    <p>4. a quarrel between the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_FDP1">FDP</gloss> on Eastern
            policy.</p>
                    <p>A convergence of these four factors would result in a strong political tremor that
            could possibly bring down the government. However, the fact that reelections now would
            benefit the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> and the fact that the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_FDP1">FDP</gloss> together command more
            votes in the Bundestag speaks against the likelihood of toppling the government now. But
            there could be a severe political crisis. The <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> and
              <gloss target="#t_FDP1">FDP</gloss> are united in their stand on Eastern policy and in
            their stand against the war in Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>It is impossible to get money appropriated for the offset agreement without the help of
            the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss>, and some people in that party contend it
            amounts to an indirect subsidy of the Vietnam war.</p>
                    <p>As it stands right now, the majority in the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> is
            against signing the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> before additional clarification
            and assurances are obtained from Washington.</p>
                    <p>Should there be a political crisis, it would arrest or reverse the modest economic
            upturn we are now experiencing. This in turn would make it harder for the Bundesbank to
            come up with the money for offset, etc.</p>
                    <p>I do not know if there are solutions to all these problems. But I thought it best to
            come here and tell a friend about these possible difficulties, as they might in turn
            affect the U. S., particularly in an election year.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rostow: I appreciate your coming here and informing me on your problems in Bonn. I
            know enough about politics to know I should not advise someone from another country
            about his politics. Moreover, I cannot respond substantively to your points with any new
            U. S. policy formulations. But I can comment.</p>
                    <pb n="633" xml:id="pg_633" facs="0663"/>
                    <p>I do not know the status in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> of time limits for
            genocide, etc. But I shall look into the issue.</p>
                    <p>As far as offset is concerned, I think we clearly have an arrangement here which favors
            Germany. We are maintaining strong military resources in Germany for the joint defense
            of Europe and this is being offset by bonds which bear interest. This means that in
            addition to holding the Central Front with our resources we help Germany accumulate
            additional surplus in its balance of payments. Any thinking politician can recognize the
            imbalance in this arrangement. This helps to buttress the arguments of those people who
            say we should bring our troops home from Europe. The argument that the German offset
            finances the war in Vietnam is nonsense. It could only be made by Germans who, in fact,
            wish the U.S. to withdraw its forces from Europe.</p>
                    <p>As regards the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>, the difficulties we experienced at
            one time on consultations resulted from the timing of the change in the German
            government. Ever since then, I believe our <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>
            consultations have been a model for what such consultations should be between friends.
            We have reviewed with you intensively and we have defended vigorously the German
            national interests. We managed to clear up a number of small matters. Then remained the
            Chancellor's two big demands:</p>
                    <p>(1) to find an acceptable formula for Euratom</p>
                    <p>(2) the matter of a time limit on the treaty.</p>
                    <p>Despite the fact that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> was not united on this
            matter, we pressed the German Euratom formula and essentially the Soviets took the
            idea.</p>
                    <p>On point two, where you have said eternity is too long a time and you want a less rigid
            clause on duration, I think we are making some headway, too; and the Soviets may meet
            that demand.</p>
                    <p>I know the arguments of the opposition, and I can understand what makes some men feel
            so deeply about this matter. At the time of the <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> funeral, I spent a good deal of time conferring with <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GKTF1">von
              Guttenberg</persName>.<note n="4" xml:id="d248fn4">No record of these conversations
              was found.</note> I know this is a difficult issue for some Germans; but it is a great
            issue for the entire world. Important common interests are at stake. I am sure there is
            no group in Germany that wants to manufacture nuclear arms. Reliance on a system of
            collective security appears to be the common interest—including the German interest—as
            opposed to the fragmentation and danger of further nuclear proliferation.</p>
                    <p>On the matter of German contacts with the East, we have always regarded this as a
            matter for Germans to settle. We did not press you to take up such contacts in the past
            when you were hesitant to do so, and we shall not stand in your way now if you want to
            pursue them further.</p>
                    <pb n="634" xml:id="pg_634" facs="0664"/>
                    <p>I, personally, always thought that it was right of you not to take up these contacts
            years ago, as I did not think it promising for you to negotiate out of a sense of
            uneasiness and weakness. Such talks should be held from a basis of strength and
            confidence, such as you now possess. But that is for you to judge.</p>
                    <p>Our problem is that we have profound commitments towards Berlin and Germany including
            their defense against nuclear arms. This is a heavy responsibility. I lived through the
            '61–'62 crisis when we had to honor our pledge to defend Berlin, and I remember that we
            did not get much support from the rest of Europe then.</p>
                    <p>Offset and cooperation on monetary matters are intimately locked to our security
            commitments. It would be viewed as intolerable here to fulfill our security commitments
            and subsidize German foreign exchange at the same time.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Barzel: We do not really fear too much that the government may fall if what I
            mentioned happens, but we fear that a strong political tremor might result with an
            adverse impact on the economy.</p>
                    <p>I know that offset and the state of the Alliance are closely interlocked. I have
            discussed this in detail with your brother Eugene.</p>
                    <p>In the arena of Eastern policy there is much illusion, in my opinion, and little
            reality. As regards Berlin, you can rest assured that we will not stray from the path of
            virtue.</p>
                    <p>Is it true that the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> is scheduled to go to the
              <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> as early as March? If this is the case, I should
            like to say a few more words about it.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rostow: (after inquiring on the telephone) It is scheduled to go to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> about March 15 and to the individual governments shortly
            afterwards. A special session of the General Assembly should be called about April to
            debate the treaty. We would hope that the debate would end some time in May so that the
            treaty can then go to the individual governments for ratification. This is how the
            people that work on the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> see the time schedule.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Barzel: I do not think we would sign the treaty before some other matters are made
            clear, like the Euratom question, for instance. We are grateful to you for getting the
            18-month verification provision into the treaty. But what if Euratom and the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> cannot reach an agreement? Our American friends tell
            us, “Do not worry, everything will continue like in the past.” But then the Soviets tell
            us something else again. What if we shall find ourselves unable to procure peaceful
            nuclear fuel?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rostow: Do I understand that you are worried about being supplied with fuel for
            peaceful nuclear purposes?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Barzel: Yes, exactly. We now get our fuel from you via Euratom. If Euratom bows out
            or collapses one day, which is quite possible, as the French do not want to sign the
            treaty, we would have to turn to the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>, <pb n="635" xml:id="pg_635" facs="0665"/>and if we apply there the Soviets are bound to say: “Now,
            wait a minute. Don't you know what the Germans would use this fuel for?”</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rostow: I don't know a specific answer to your question offhand, but I would say,
            since we have found answers to the other questions in the past, we should find a
            solution here also.</p>
                    <p>Some countries have said they will sign the treaty but delay ratification until a
              Euratom-<gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> accord has been reached. We understand
            their concern. However, in some countries the pressure to ratify is strong. What, then,
            if they ratify and later no accord is reached? The outcome would depend on the nature of
            the difficulty. If it were a serious political matter it might hold up application of
            the treaty; if it were a question of technical details, perhaps the 18 months might be
            extended. I can tell you that those who work on this matter do not see great
            difficulties in the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> negotiation. The scientists are not half as worried about this as are
            the lawyers and politicians.</p>
                    <p>If Euratom should dissolve for some reason, bear in mind that past history shows the
            generous attitude of this country in the supply of nuclear fuel for peaceful purposes to
            others. We recently passed legislation increasing the amounts of fuel for foreign
            consumption. We make fuel available to countries that are not very friendly to us,
            because there is a certain responsibility involved in being a nuclear power. After
            signing the treaty, our responsibility for supplying for peaceful purposes would become
            even greater. Your question about fuel supply in the event of a Euratom collapse is
            fair. You understand you and I cannot settle it here. But if your government wishes to
            pose the matter, it should be discussed in the spirit of the Chancellor's talks with the
            President. The history of the <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>-Kiesinger
            meetings has shown that the President listens to these questions with attention and
            sympathy.</p>
                    <p>To summarize: I think you should clearly define the specific questions that still
            concern you. Then you should bring them before us or raise them in a multilateral forum.
            Then we can work together to find answers.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Barzel: I understand and I will pass along your advice. We want to remove the
            uncertainty. We do not want to sign any treaties, con dolus (in bad faith) as we did
            after World War I. We have to worry about the security of Europe in the '70's, in the
              post-<persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> nuclear period. You say the
            double-key system will not be touched by the treaty. The Soviets refuse to confirm that
            to us. We know what the situation is in Scandinavia. These questions are hotly debated
            in my party and must be cleared up to have the majority endorse the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rostow: Surely the Soviets tried in the first phase of the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> talks to bring about the destruction of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, to do away with the <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
            committee and the double-key system. We made it clear to them that we would have none of
            that. We agreed in the second phase, about <pb n="636" xml:id="pg_636" facs="0666"/>September 1966, after the <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> talk, that the treaty would narrowly concern what
            was required to avoid nuclear proliferation. What it didn't forbid was not forbidden.
            That is not just our understanding, that is the Soviets' as well. They know that they
            cannot raise the double-key question or the question of nuclear consultation. That is
            fundamental to our understanding. We will tell that to our Congress and you can say that
            to the Bundestag.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Barzel: This interpretation is all right for the present situation, but what may
            happen 5 or 10 years from now? The situation may be different then. Scandinavia, Greece,
            Turkey may then be unreliable or the U.S. may turn its interests away.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rostow: First, you know that in our constitutional system any treaty that passed
            the Senate is binding on all subsequent administrations. Vietnam illustrates this point.
            President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> was prepared to honor President
            Eisenhower's commitment on the Gulf of Aqaba.</p>
                    <p>Second, if you were faced with a critical situation where your national security would
            be at stake—should the U.S. move its nuclear arms out of Europe, for instance—I assure
            you we do not intend to do that—then you would be able to denounce the treaty under the
            supreme-national-interest clause.</p>
                    <p>So you have one check against your fear in our constitutional system and another in the
            supreme-national-interest clause of the treaty. We understand that the position of the
            non-nuclear-weapons countries is vital for the future of the world; and we intend to
            find solutions that allow these countries to live in dignity with this treaty. We
            understand that we assume grave responsibilities with this treaty.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Barzel: Let me bring up one more point before leaving one of the busiest and most
            important men in the world. In the military area I have few doubts, but I have one
            political worry. You know we have a very progressive nuclear institution in Karlsruhe.
            In some small areas we may even be ahead of you.</p>
                    <p>One day, maybe when we file a fuel application in Vienna, the Soviets will denounce our
            efforts as military research. They have constantly tried to get at us in the past and
            would not be likely to pass up such an opportunity. You know we deliver reactors to
            other countries. We are living on a small area and have to make a living from
            technology.</p>
                    <p>At this time when <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>s and <gloss target="#t_FOB1">FOB</gloss>s are already realities, we are supposed to have our hands bound. This
            could put us into enough of a predicament one day that it may cause some type of
            explosion.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rostow: There are two separate matters here. First, there is nothing in the treaty
            that prevents peaceful research. The treaty is concerned with non-proliferation of
            nuclear weapons. Second, of course, the treaty cannot prevent the Soviets from mounting
            a propaganda attack against <pb n="637" xml:id="pg_637" facs="0667"/>Karlsruhe or
            anything else. Nobody here at the White House believes that the Soviets wish either of
            us well.</p>
                    <p>I think I know how the President feels with regard to the defense of Europe. With all
            the heavy pressures from Vietnam, and with not a damn bit of help from Europe, he has
            not withdrawn any of our troops from Europe. In 1961 he was at the Wall in Berlin when
            it went up. We may have to stand together against propaganda attacks on Karlsruhe, or
            worse. Under pressure, our defense is not the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>. It is
            that we remain partners that trust each other. To quote from Benjamin Franklin, “We must
            all hang together or surely we will all hang separately. “</p>
                    <p>The simple fact is that Germany depends, and must depend, on collective nuclear
            defense. If you would not sign, and decided to defend yourself with your own nuclear
            weapons, you would</p>
                    <p>(a) tear apart the Alliance</p>
                    <p>(b) face a very difficult period during which you might well be destroyed.</p>
                    <p>We need a free and secure Germany. It is in our interest and yours. So let us find the
            answers to these specific questions together in the spirit of Benjamin Franklin. This
            spirit has prevailed between President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>
            and Chancellor Kiesinger so far. I see no salvation any other way. We have now lived
            together as friends and partners successfully for 25 years. So let us take these
            questions one by one and find common answers to them.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Barzel: I agree with you. No agreement or treaty will be any good unless we can
            trust each other.</p>
                    <p>Just one final point before I leave. A lot will depend on the manner in which the
              <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> report is presented to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Will it be a case of “Bird eat or die!” (Vogel friss oder stirb), as we
            say in Germany, or will the birds be offered the food with an option to eat or not? Will
            there be a chance for any changes at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in the
            package sent up by Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> and
            Roschin?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rostow: (after consulting on the telephone) I am told that the debate in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> will not be just pro forma. I do not see how it could be,
            anyhow. There will be some opportunity for changes at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> level.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Barzel: I want to thank you, <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt</persName>, for
            giving me so much of your precious time. You may take the fact that I made this long
            trip solely to talk with you as a sign that we regard these questions with great
            seriousness.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Begin summary</hi>: The Feb 15–16 Paris visit of Chancellor Kiesinger
            and <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> Brandt, and the subsequent German reaction
            to the outcome are believed to provide evidence of: A) The continuing importance which
            the Fed Govt, and particularly Chancellor Kiesinger personally, attribute to relations
            with France; B) The extent of agreement and disagreement in German and French top-level
            thinking on the future shape of Europe; and C) The wide acceptance in Germany of the
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>'s policy of determined friendship toward France
            despite disillusionment over the past months with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName> personally. The Germans appear reasonably satisfied for the present
            with the limited “progress” made with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>
            on enlarging the <gloss target="#t_CM1">CM</gloss>, but were not able to “smoke out” the
            French position on <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> and in particular on negotiations
            between <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> on a verification procedure. Kiesinger's thinking on the future role of
            Europe now seems to place more emphasis on the European, than on the Atlantic focus, but
            he is very firm that the Europe of the future must act in friendly agreement with the
            US. His concept, therefore, does not seem necessarily in conflict with that of an
            Atlantic partnership. While the depth of his commitment to France has been shown to be
            even greater than we earlier anticipated, he seems determined that it will not interfere
            with German vital interests, nor relations with us. <hi rend="italic">End
            summary</hi>.</p>
                    <p>1. The Feb 15–16 Paris visit of Chancellor Kiesinger and a good part of his Cabinet, is
            being interpreted in quite different ways in the various European capitals. I have had
            an opportunity to discuss the visit both with the Chancellor and the <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> (reftels), and we have also talked extensively with
            other German officials who were members of the party. This, together with the reaction
            of German politicians and the German press, has enabled us to reach certain conclusions
            concerning the significance of the visit, which I am setting forth in this message.</p>
                    <p>2. Gen <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> had prepared the stage for the
            German visit by a very unfair exploitation of the false report of Brandt's Ravensburg
              <pb n="639" xml:id="pg_639" facs="0669"/>speech. A cloud seemed to hang over the
            visit, which when it happily disappeared, made the sun of French friendship seem all the
            brighter—as perhaps was <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>'s intent all
            along. This was a matter of atmos-pherics, however, which can change again in the future
            just as they did before and during the visit. In assessing the present trend in
            Germany's relations with France, it is considered more important to examine the actual
            substantive agreements and disagreements apparent during the meeting.</p>
                    <p>3. The greatest attention, in Germany as elsewhere, went to the British <gloss target="#t_CM1">CM</gloss> entry issue. From Kiesinger down, the Germans treated the
            outcome as a modest success in the continuing German efforts to find a solution which
            will lead to eventual British admission without a crisis within the <gloss target="#t_CM1">CM</gloss>. Although the view is widely held elsewhere, including in
            France, that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> “caved in” under French pressure,
            neither the German media nor any important German politicians have seriously suggested
            that this is so.</p>
                    <p>4. The Germans had much earlier considered but never defined a concept of British entry
            “by stages.” This may permit temporary accept-ance of the contention that what was
            agreed in Paris was in line with prior German ideas—even though State Sec <persName corresp="#p_LR7">Lahr</persName>, who is perhaps the most influential man in the
            German Govt on Common Market questions, was undoubtedly thinking in larger terms than
            those agreed with the French. It remains to be seen whether there can be any real
            advance on the question of British entry, however, the Germans have for the time being
            at least produced evidence that the door to British entry is not entirely closed and
            that opportunities exist for progress—if the British will take them. This was important
            from the German internal point of view and has been accomplished for the present to the
            general satisfaction of the German public. This can, of course, be changed if the
            Brussels meeting Feb 29 results in either the French backing out of their understanding
            with the Germans or strong opposition to the German-French understanding by the other
              <gloss target="#t_CM1">CM</gloss> countries.</p>
                    <p>5. A most interesting aspect of the Chancellor's account of his talks with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> was the indication it provided of Kiesinger's
            present thinking on Europe. He emphasized to me that he is seeking a Europe which would
            follow a European policy, but in harmony with the US. Whereas <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> sees the future Europe as a third force between
            the two super powers, Kiesinger sees it as a bridge between them—a means of “distancing”
            them and helping relieve tensions between them. He opposes, as does de Gaulle but for
            different reasons, what he refers to as the “imperium concept” which would bring a tight
            Atlantic alliance up to the border of the Communist world, because it would put Germany
            at the point of contact between the two—and create a constant threat to peace.</p>
                    <pb n="640" xml:id="pg_640" facs="0670"/>
                    <p>6. This concept permits Kiesinger, in long-range terms, to find as he undoubtedly
            wishes—a fairly wide area of philosophical agreement with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName>, since both place emphasis on a Europe of the future with a European
            policy. A part of Kiesinger's thinking embraces the idea that Europe “should put its
            house in order” so that it can achieve an independent role—which is, of course, what
              <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> also demands.</p>
                    <p>7. There are, however, important differences between the German and French views. The
            Germans still, in principle, seek a greater degree of European political unity than
              <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>, although Kiesinger's faith in its
            achievement may be wavering. The Germans wish to maintain the Alliance at least until a
            new European order is achieved. I think the essential difference, however, is the point
            which Kiesinger made three times to me—that Europe as it goes forward must act “in
            friendly agreement” with the United States. It is also noteworthy that he made this
            point very clear in public, immediately after the Paris meeting.</p>
                    <p>8. Implicit in the bilateral agreement reached between France and Germany on broad
            questions affecting Europe's future is the suggestion of an emergent German-French
            leadership of the <gloss target="#t_CM1">CM</gloss>. This was put into words by French
            Amb Seydoux at a large dinner here last week, when he spoke of the comforting fact that
            the Paris talks had shown Europe now to be under outstanding leadership, i.e., that of
              <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> and Kiesinger. We detect a good bit
            of satisfaction in German quarters at this prospect, and less concern than in the past
            over the predictably adverse reaction in the smaller European countries who tend to
            equate French-German “leadership” with French-German domination. Germans perhaps derive
            some satisfaction in being, for the present, even second man in such a combination. They
            are increasingly sought out by those who wish them to use their influence with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>—i.e. by US in trade and monetary talks, the
              <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> for <gloss target="#t_CM1">CM</gloss> entry, and the
            Italians on various <gloss target="#t_CM1">CM</gloss> issues.</p>
                    <p>9. The German side considered <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> the second most
            important topic to be discussed in Paris, and they certainly hoped to achieve a
            clarification of the French position on <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> and in
            particular on negotiations between <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> and
              <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> on a verification agreement. They appear,
            however, to have made no real progress on these questions. The French, as in the past,
            repeated their disapproval of the principle of the treaty. <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Franz Josef Strauss</persName>, in a television interview from Paris, suggested that
            the French had no interest in the Germans signing the treaty, since the Germans were
            already committed under the <gloss target="#t_WEU1">WEU</gloss> not to manufacture
            nuclear weapons. The <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss>, however, has
            categorically denied to us that the French in any way suggested that the Germans should
            not sign the treaty. We think it is fair assumption that the Germans were told again by
            the French that the treaty is an iniquitous example of Soviet-American power politics,
            but that the decision to sign is their own. They did not follow this to the logical
            conclusion, however, in giving insight <pb n="641" xml:id="pg_641" facs="0671"/>into
            their own future course of action on matters of vital importance to the German decision.
            Thus, elements in the German Govt opposed to the treaty such as <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> returned from Paris strengthened in their
            opposition. Those like Brandt and possibly Kiesinger, who were seeking some sign of
            French intentions in <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> which might permit the
            German side to move forward toward acceptance of the treaty, unfortunately returned
            without much satisfaction.</p>
                    <p>10. From the point of view of US interests, I realize that the vague French-German
            proposal for an enlarged free trade area without foreseeable political unity is
            disturbing. We can only take comfort in Kiesinger's assertion to us that this must lead
            to <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> entry, and in the still doubtful prospects of
            success of this approach. If it does gain momentum, however, I frankly doubt that there
            is much we can do about it, unless we have a demonstrably better alternative to offer
            the British. Our Western European allies view this problem as essentially European, and
            I believe we shall have to accept the solution they find. Active intervention by us on
            this issue now would give <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> an excellent
            pretext for claiming that the “Americans” wrecked the chances for any progress on <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> entry.</p>
                    <p>11. In light of all of the evidence, I do not believe that Kiesinger's concept of the
            future of Europe is in conflict with our Atlantic partnership concept. There is no
            evidence that such a Europe will, for a long time, be willing to make an important
            contribution toward the world's “trouble spots.” If, however, the Europe Kiesinger is
            speaking of can eventually build the capacity to defend itself without the indefinite
            presence of US forces this would, as Kiesinger suggests, permit us to be relieved of an
            unwelcome burden. Moreover, a Europe which would no longer be a direct scene of the
            Soviet-US confrontation might indeed move more easily toward friendly cohesion.
            Certainly, the concept is broad enough to permit the Germans to work on it
            constructively, both with France and with their other allies, including the US. This
            seems to me to be in our interest, even if some adjustment in our concept of Europe's
            future role may be required in the process.</p>

                    <p>1. I believe it would be worthwhile for you to go and see Brandt and tell him that with
            regard to the proposed visit to Hanoi by an official <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss>
            delegation (reftel), the decision is one of course to be taken by Brandt and his party.
            Brandt should, however, be aware of the fact that the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> by authorizing an official delegation is in effect associating the
            Government of the Federal Republic with this trip. Hanoi is sure to interpret the trip
            this way and so it would be seen here too. While it would not be the first visit by
            individual Parliamentarians from a non-Communist country, a trip by a group of German
            Parliamentarians approved by the leadership of the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss>
            would be interpreted as lack of support for the U.S. on the part of the government of
            one of its principal Allies. I believe it would not be out of order to suggest to Brandt
            that such a visit to Hanoi would be seen in much the same light as many Germans would
            view the visit of an official US Congressional delegation (made up of one of our two
            major parties) to East Germany.<note n="3" xml:id="d250fn3">In telegram 127694, March 9,

                        <item>Eastern European Support for Berlin Crisis</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>You asked whether it might now be harder for the Soviets to start something in Berlin
            than in 1961. Would there be less support from Warsaw Pact allies? Would this
            effectively slow down the Soviets?</p>
                    <p>There are three obvious ways a Berlin crisis could come: (1) as a clear decision, after
            consultation with Warsaw Pact allies; (2) as a Soviet decision with little consultation
            (perhaps only with the East Germans and the Poles); or (3) as an East German initiative
            (taking advantage of an ambiguous Soviet attitude). In any case, the crisis might well
            start with harassments, East or West German police shot, or other incidents where the
            fault and the initiative were not clear. Probably the West Germans would initially be
            the ones involved—not the occupying powers.</p>
                    <p>If there were prior Warsaw Pact consultation, there would be strong voices opposing a
            Berlin move. All the allies except the East Germans and Poles would be unhappy. The
            Czechs realize that their economic troubles are partly the result of the military
            readiness they had to maintain during the recurring Berlin crises of 1959–1961. Their
            imports from West Germany have doubled in the past half dozen years (I am sending you a
            separate paper on this) and they have a strong interest in trade with the West. The
            Romanians would almost surely dissociate themselves from a Berlin initiative, and oppose
            it furiously. The Hungarians and Bulgarians would be most reluctant.</p>
                    <p>It is more likely the Soviets would engineer it without giving their allies a chance to
            object. It is only too easy for a crisis to grow of itself in Berlin, and no Warsaw Pact
            ally would be in a position to withhold public support. This would be all that would be
            required (except from the East Germans and the Poles) in the initial stages. The
            southern tier allies might later be asked to mobilize, curtail trade with Bonn, and
            close down diplomatic and trade missions. By that time, however, the Berlin crisis might
            really have taken on a momentum and life of its own.</p>
                    <p>There is a real possibility that <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> might
            sense an ambiguity in Soviet attitudes and start slicing salami slices off the Berlin
            status quo. Polycentrism in Eastern Europe has not left Pankow untouched, and it <pb n="644" xml:id="pg_644" facs="0674"/>gives Ulbricht a weight and maneuverability which
            he once did not have.</p>
                    <p>There is an idea floating around the Intelligence Community that the Soviets might
            initiate a Berlin crisis in order to weld together the Warsaw Bloc. This is a minority
            view. Most analysts believe the Soviets are essentially cautious—particularly the
            current collective leadership—and not anxious to sacrifice their gains in Western
            Europe, their developing relationship with DeGaulle and the exploitable fissures in the
            West German coalition. While a Berlin crisis might force a degree of Eastern European
            solidarity, it would be bitterly resented.</p>
                    <p>Conclusion: Moscow's Eastern European allies south of Poland and East Germany would no
            doubt try to restrain the Soviets from initiating a Berlin crisis. However, if a crisis
            of ambiguous origin comes along, they are not in a good position to influence its
            development. With the possible exception of the Romanians, they would not be able to put
            themselves in the position of saying, “we won't support you.” A crisis might, in fact,
            force the Czechs and others to pull in their horns. It would also produce deep
            resentments at being manipulated once again by Moscow.</p>

                    <p>130816. Deliver following message from the President to Chancellor Kiesinger as soon as
            possible:</p>
                    <p>“March 15, 1968</p>
                    <p>Dear Chancellor Kiesinger:</p>
                    <p>By now you will know that the Bank of England has acted to close the London gold market
            and that the governors of the central banks, active in the Gold Pool, have been invited
            to meet in Washington this week end.</p>
                    <pb n="645" xml:id="pg_645" facs="0675"/>
                    <p>It is plain that we have at hand the means to overcome the dangers caused by the
            disorder in the gold market. The speculators are banking on an increase in the official
            price of gold. They are wrong.</p>
                    <p>We can act together through the central banks to contain the speculative movements of
            funds that will almost surely occur in the next few weeks. Above all, we can act
            promptly to ratify and implement a plan for Special Drawing Rights as a means of
            replacing the reserves destroyed by speculation since the devaluation, and of meeting
            our needs for growth in reserves.</p>
                    <p>But it remains true that these financial disorders—if not promptly and firmly
            overcome—can profoundly damage the political relations between Europe and America and
            set in motion forces like those which disintegrated the Western world between 1929 and
            1933. That is why the meeting in Washington this week end—and the cooperation it must
            organize—is of extraordinary importance to us both.</p>
                    <p>I hope that we can remain in close touch as our bankers and ministers work to devise
            means to overcome these dangers.<note n="2" xml:id="d252fn2">In a March 17 reply,

                    <p>9894. For the Secretary. Pass to the White House for the President. Subj: Kiesinger
            disturbed over reports from Washington.</p>
                    <p>1. I called on Chancellor Kiesinger yesterday to accompany Amb <persName corresp="#p_SJR3">Schaetzel</persName> whom the Chancellor received, as an old friend,
            on the occasion of his current visit to Bonn. With some emotion, the Chancellor <pb n="646" xml:id="pg_646" facs="0676"/>turned to me and said that he had been disturbed
            to hear reports from “recent German visitors to Washington” of “worries and doubts
            around the President” with respect to him and his govt. It was the form in which these
            doubts were expressed, as well as their content, which worried him. “Evidently our
            recent actions have not been understood in Washington.” German visitors were told “by
            someone close to the Pres” that “the Pres feels cheated (by Kiesinger)”. He would like
            to repeat that “as long as I am Chancellor I will steer the course that I discussed with
            the Pres when I met with him last year.”</p>
                    <p>2. Moreover he has not, as alleged in Washington, engaged in any conspiracy with the
            Communists. It is true that he is trying to improve relations with the Eastern
            countries; however, he was not trying to “woo the Reds” as had been charged in
            Washington. It had also been said that he had knowledge of and had acquiesced in
            “certain conversations” which had taken place. (I refer that he referred to
            conversations between <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> officials and rep of the
            Italian Communist Party (<gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss>) reported in Embtel
              3682,<note n="2" xml:id="d253fn2">Dated October 4, 1967. (Ibid., DEF 4 <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>)</note> which Kiesinger appears to have discovered
            only in mid-February, see Embtel 8934.)<note n="3" xml:id="d253fn3">Dated February 29.
              (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 12 <gloss target="#t_GER1">GER</gloss>
              W)</note> He had also heard the reproach that the “<gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss>
            was the real master” of coalition Eastern policy, and that the Chancellor merely
            followed. He wanted to make it clear that the govt's policy was his policy. He was not
            moving to the left; the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> was moving to the right.
            There were forces in the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> trying to push the govt
            into a different policy; however, he had intervened to block this. The <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> himself had given him to reason for doubt, although
            he did not like the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> attitude toward Viet-Nam. He was
            not in favor of being “a school master to Americans.”</p>
                    <p>3. Kiesinger continued that he had also heard from German visitors to Washington
            accusations that he was following a Gaullist policy. He had been accused of making a
            secret agreement with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> in their last
            meeting. As he had told me when he returned from the meeting (Embtel 8667),<note n="4" xml:id="d253fn4">

              292</ref>.</note> he was unhappy that France had left the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> had assured him,
            however, that he would not leave the Alliance and that he welcomed US troops in Europe.
            He had told <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> underrated the Sov danger and had criticized
              <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> for having said that “the US could
            not help but dominate.” He had pointed out to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName> that his anti-American feeling was losing him support in Germany,
            whereupon de Gaulle had explained to him that he had to take this attitude for domestic
            reasons.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>, said Kiesinger, knows the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>'s opinion about currency and balance of payments
            problems—the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> rejection of his efforts <pb n="647" xml:id="pg_647" facs="0677"/>to create a new gold standard. He regretted that despite
            Germany's efforts <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> would not accept an
            accelerated <gloss target="#t_KR1">KR</gloss>. He and <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName> differed on <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> entry, and some have
            accused him of not talking forcefully enough to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName> on this issue. He had not done more because he knew <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> would not agree. Since he had no effective way
            of put-ting on pressure, he had to be content with a modest step forward. He had
            purposely left the arrangements made in Paris regarding <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> entry vague; otherwise all of his efforts would have failed. The French
            have since pressed for a narrow interpretation of what was agreed in Paris, whereas the
            Germans have sought a liberal interpretation. President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> had told him in their meeting last year that he must be “the
            harmonizer” between the US and <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>. He had
            made no secret agreements with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>. He had
            nothing to hide. He still believed, however, in the Franco-German treaty. Any rupture
            between France and Germany would be the end of efforts to build Europe. Indeed, he hoped
            in the future to come closer to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> in
            Eastern policy.</p>
                    <p>5. With respect to his views toward Europe, he had told <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName> of his belief in an “independent Europe in friendly partnership with
            the US.” He corrected himself to say that “independent” was not quite the word—that what
            he sought could be better described as a “Europe that stood on its own feet.” This was
            his firm decision. Any discussion with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>
            was a struggle—“A heavy battle.” He knew, however, that de Gaulle cannot realize that
            role that he has in mind for himself and France.</p>
                    <p>6. Kiesinger referred to his “Atlantic imperium” concept, which he outlined on March 11
            in his speech to the Bundestag.<note n="5" xml:id="d253fn5">For text, see <hi rend="italic">Documents on Germany, 1944–1985</hi>, pp. 990–997.</note> There
            appears to have been a misunderstanding of his remarks on the part of certain sections
            of the American press, and certain American individuals. For example, <persName corresp="#p_BK6">Birrenbach</persName> has heard that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> was disturbed. Perhaps his use of the word “imperium” was a bad
            one. Some people might as a result consider what he had said Gaullism. He had hesitated,
            however, to use the word community, since he did not feel it was descriptive.</p>
                    <p>7. Amb <persName corresp="#p_SJR3">Schaetzel</persName> commented that the views as
            reported to the Chancellor did not accord with those he had heard during his recent
            visit to Washington. Quite to the contrary, there was widespread appreciation for the
            Chancellor's support which had been particularly helpful during the recent gold crisis.
            He stressed that, during the present unsettled period when both of us are under great
            tension and pressure, we must make a particular effort to avoid misunderstandings.</p>
                    <p>8. I assured the Chancellor that the views which he reported did not conform with those
            that I had encountered in my recent visit to Washington, nor with any reports from this
            Embassy nor comments in messages <pb n="648" xml:id="pg_648" facs="0678"/>from my govt.
            I had reported fully what he had told me about his last meeting with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>, and my interpretation that he had not let us
            down was to my knowledge the view in Washington. As I had under instructions told him in
            our meeting on Feb. 22 we had no concerns with Germany's Eastern policy. Indeed, it is
            wholly in line with the President's views as expressed in his speech of Oct. 7,
              1966.<note n="6" xml:id="d253fn6">For text, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the

                            </hi>, 1966, Book II, pp. 1125–1130.</note> I thought I knew what he was referring to
            when he spoke of conversations with the Communists. We knew that he was unaware of these
            discussions at the time and of his reaction when they were later reported to him. No one
            suspected him of collusion with the Communists. I had repeated to Washington his full
            views on the future of Europe, as he had expressed them to me on Feb 22 (Bonn
              8692).<note n="7" xml:id="d253fn7">See <ref target="#d248fn3">footnote 3, Document
                248</ref>.</note> Apart from his use of the word imperium, which could create some
            ambiguity, his views were in full accord with our well- known European unity-Atlantic
            partnership approach. Nothing that I had heard from Washington had indicated any concern
            over his remarks. I expressed doubt that any responsible US official could have made any
            considered remarks of the nature he described. Certainly they did not reflect the views
            of the Pres or the SecState. Particularly in time of tension and under informal
            circumstances with old German friends, it was possible that loose remarks could have
            been made which could be misinterpreted.</p>
                    <p>9. The Chancellor appeared somewhat assuaged by Amb <persName corresp="#p_SJR3">Schaetzel</persName>'s and my remarks. However, it is clear that he believes in the
            authenticity of the reports of German visitors which have upset him. Naturally, he did
            not volunteer nor did I question him on the personalities involved.</p>
                    <p>10. <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: I feel sure that whatever was said in Washington—if
            it was said—has been badly misquoted and misinterpreted to the Chancellor. The reports
            are obviously irresponsible, and I do not exclude the possibility that they constitute a
            deliberate effort to cause trouble. In addition to German visitors, it is conceivable
            that members of the German Emb are involved. We are not able, however, from what we know
            here, to pin the matter down further.</p>
                    <p>11. The important thing, however, is that the Chancellor is disturbed over false
            rumors, at a time when we need him most. We must be absolutely sure that nothing is done
            to upset the excellent relationship of mutual confidence between Kiesinger and the Pres.
            We must reassure Kiesinger that we do not doubt him.</p>
                    <p>12. Particularly in the light of the important contribution which Germany made through
            Bundesbank Pres Blessing to the success of the monetary <pb n="649" xml:id="pg_649" facs="0679"/>meeting held in Washington on March 16–17, I strongly recommend that the
            Pres send a letter to Kiesinger expressing our appreciation for this assistance. At the
            same time I believe it would be appropriate, without referring to the present
            conversation, for the Pres to add a few remarks expressing full confidence in the
            Chancellor in his relations with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> and in
            his Eastern policy.<note n="8" xml:id="d253fn8">In a March 27 letter to Kiesinger,
              transmitted in telegram 136964 to Bonn, President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> praised the “contribution” that his exchanges with the German
              Chancellor were having in creating progress in trade, finance, and security for
              Europe. (Johnson Library, National Security File, Special Head of State
              Correspondence, Germany)</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>13. In the future I hope that all high officials will be most cautious that their
            remarks do not cast doubt as to our own attitude toward the Chancellor or Germany—or
            suggest that we suspect any disloyalty or change in their attitude toward us.</p>

                    <p>1176. From the Ambassador. Subject: Ambassador's talk with Governing Mayor Schuetz.</p>
                    <p>1. I called on GovMayor Schuetz today accompanied by Minister Morris. We talked for
            about forty minutes on several topics. Schuetz and I had a private conversation about
            Senat-Allied consultations, which I shall be reporting separately.<note n="2" xml:id="d254fn2">Telegram 1177 from Berlin, March 26. (Ibid.)</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>2. Student demonstrations. I complimented Schuetz in the way the Senat and police had
            handled the March 23 Vietnam demonstration. I remarked that we are sorry that
            demonstrations against our Vietnam policy have recently caused German officials extra
            work. Schuetz said that he felt his government and the police were doing better recently
            in finding the right degree of flexibility in responding to demonstrations. The March 23
            episode was not significant; police estimates (3,000 participants) <pb n="650" xml:id="pg_650" facs="0680"/>actually were quite high. The disappointing thing was
            that despite the unimportant size of such demonstrations compared to Berlin's
            population, they continued to receive extensive press and TV coverage.</p>
                    <p>3. Soviet Trade Center in West Berlin. I told Schuetz that in view of the increased
            Soviet aggressiveness and the rash of spurious complaints that they had been making
            recently, the US Government was not inclined to favor increased Soviet presence in West
            Berlin at this time. The things SovAmb Abrasimov and the East Germans were saying about
            rampant Nazi activity in West Berlin were clearly exaggerated.<note n="3" xml:id="d254fn3">
                            <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName>'s March 13 letter outlining charges
              regarding the NDP was forwarded to the Department of State in telegram 1109 from
              Berlin, March 13. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 28 <gloss target="#t_GER1">GER</gloss> B) The Department of State provided a response in
              telegram 134324 to Bonn, March 21. (Ibid.)</note> Their protests about Federal German
            activities here seemed an attempt to turn back the clock. We see nothing wrong with such
            activities as the Federal Republic has been carrying on in West Berlin, although we
            would be happier if the Defense Committee did not meet here again (Schuetz indicated
            full agreement on this point).</p>
                    <p>I said I would be seeing <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> for lunch and
            would tell him as well that we are displeased with the present aggressive Soviet
            attitude toward West Berlin.</p>
                    <p>Schuetz said he understood our view, but he still thought there might be value in
            having a Soviet trade representation in West Berlin—under German law, not Allied
            aegis—since the Senat felt that for businessmen to conduct business through the Soviet
            Embassy in East Berlin implied that the Embassy was competent for all of Berlin. I
            repeated that we were not inclined to accept such increased Soviet presence at this
            time.</p>
                    <p>4. Soviet flights over West Berlin. Schuetz raised the subject of recent Soviet
            overflights as another possible example of a harder Soviet attitude. I recapitulated for
            him the recent incidents and the unsatisfactory Soviet replies to our protests. The
            overflights seemed clearly to fall into the category of harassment. I said I would also
            speak to <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> about this matter as well.</p>
                    <p>5. Berlin economy. I remarked that the Schering Company's plan to build a large new
            laboratory in Berlin was a gratifying example of industry's support for the Berlin
            economy. Schuetz agreed and said that despite some initial difficulty in acquiring the
            property necessary for the new plant, the project now seemed well underway. He still had
            the impression, however, that Berlin would have to keep up pressure on German
            industriallists to increase their interest in investing here. Berlin also hopes to
            achieve some results with US businessmen through the help of the German Consulates. I
            said I was sorry that our balance of payments deficit would restrict US investment here,
            but that we would still encourage US firms to invest locally-acquired funds in Berlin.
            Schuetz agreed <pb n="651" xml:id="pg_651" facs="0681"/>that this course offered good
            possibilities. He had received the impression in Washington that despite the moratorium
            on investments, Berlin might still be able to get US consideration of important specific
            projects which could not be financed locally. I told him that I could not give him any
            encouragement on this point.</p>
                    <p>6. University reform. I noted that the public hearings on the draft Berlin University
            reform law were beginning March 25, and asked Schuetz what progress he expected. He
            replied that some politicians still hoped to pass a new university law by the end of
            1968, but that most experts were less optimistic. Strangely, the students themselves
            were now urging that a new law not be passed too quickly. The most important change
            being considered would be the replacement of the Rector by a professional president,
            after the American pattern. Since this would bring a significant change to the
            traditional privileges and powers of professors, the new law would meet with criticism
            from all sides.</p>
                    <p>7. Berlin morale. Schuetz said that there still seemed to be a general uneasiness in
            Berlin about the future of the city. Berliners fear specifically that the Federal
            Government may be growing less concerned about their problems, “especially since that
            business at Nuernberg” (referring to the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss>
              Congress).<note n="4" xml:id="d254fn4">For text of the portion of the March 21 <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> Congress statement dealing with foreign policy and
              Berlin issues, see Meissner, <hi rend="italic">Die deutsche Ostpolitik</hi>, pp.
              245–247.</note> I said that we wanted to help as much as possible, and that we would
            support efforts to have the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> Berlin aid law extended
            indefinitely. Schuetz said that extension of the aid law would be a psychological boost
            for the city, as well as a material benefit.</p>
                    <p>8. Problems in the Berlin <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss>. Schuetz was not too
            forthcoming about problems in the Berlin <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss>. He summed
            them up by saying “the left wants to dominate the party.” He said personal ambition was
            mostly to blame, as was the left's “tradition” of fighting the party majority. There
            really is little dispute on substantive issues, with the possible exception of policy
            toward student demonstrations.</p>
                    <p>9. <gloss target="#t_RIAS1">RIAS</gloss>. Schuetz raised the subject of <gloss target="#t_RIAS1">RIAS</gloss> personnel cuts, saying that he had just written a
            letter to Minister Morris (not yet received) and also had written to USIA Director
              <persName corresp="#p_MLH1">Leonard Marks</persName> stressing the importance of
            avoiding any hint that the US was reducing its presence in Berlin.<note n="5" xml:id="d254fn5">The text of the letter was transmitted in telegram 1184 from Berlin,
              March 27. (Department of State, Central Files, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_GER1">GER</gloss> W–US)</note> I told Schuetz that we felt it
            imperative to reduce our costs in running <gloss target="#t_RIAS1">RIAS</gloss>, but
            that this did not mean we were reducing our presence or interest. We had discussed the
            problem with FedRep Minister <persName corresp="#p_WH6">Wehner</persName>, who was now
            investigating other possible sources of additional funds. We hoped also to streamline
              <gloss target="#t_RIAS1">RIAS</gloss> staffing inter alia by means of the normal
            attrition rate. Schuetz said this was reassuring. He had been very concerned <pb n="652" xml:id="pg_652" facs="0682"/>lest a noticeable change in <gloss target="#t_RIAS1">RIAS</gloss> spark public speculation about lessening US interest in Berlin.</p>

            Secretary.</p>
                    <p>1. I read your message 9894 regarding Kiesinger's state of mind with amazement. We have
            reviewed the list of recent German visitors to Washington and whom they saw. It is in
            our view inconceivable that any accurate report of these meetings could have resulted in
            the kind of conclusions Kiesinger came to, as reported in your telegram.</p>
                    <p>2. Since receiving your message, we have had further confirmation of Kiesinger's
            concern via Walther Casper. Latter saw <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt
              Rostow</persName> informally, March 24,<note n="3" xml:id="d255fn3">No record of this
              meeting was found.</note> and said that Kiesinger had recently received a
            circumstantial document in English alleging that Rostow had expressed strong criticism
            of Kiesinger along lines reported in your cable. It was also alleged that <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> had made similar remarks, although less
            strongly stated. According to report received by Chancellor, President feels that
            Kiesinger has “betrayed” the United States on a whole series of questions, including
            making “secret agreements” with de Gaulle, selling out the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> on the Common Market, approving secret contacts between German Socialists
            and Communist politicians, passing on to East Germans knowledge derived from contacts
            with President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>, taking a weak position on
            Viet-Nam, and subverting the Atlantic partnership.</p>
                    <p>3. Rostow made clear to Casper that views of this kind had not been expressed by him
            and were not views of US Government. Rostow noted that he had recently seen only two
            German visitors, <persName corresp="#p_DGF3">Duckwitz</persName> and Barzel (latter was
            here on unannounced and unreported visit),<note n="4" xml:id="d255fn4">A memorandum of
              conversation of the Rostow-Barzel meeting is <ref target="#d248">Document 248</ref>.
                <persName corresp="#p_DGF3">Duckwitz</persName> visited Washington February 28. No
              record of this meeting was found.</note> to both of whom <pb n="653" xml:id="pg_653" facs="0683"/>he had expressed quite different views. Rostow told Casper that he could
            advise Chancellor that reputed views were not his nor those of US Government.</p>
                    <p>4. Casper had informed us that he was in touch with Chancellor by telephone morning of
            March 25 and that latter was much relieved to hear his report on talk with Rostow.
            Chancellor told Casper he would abandon further efforts to seek clarification of alleged
            views of US Government but that he would attempt to track down source of misinformation,
            since it was clear that someone was trying to make trouble between our two
            countries.</p>
                    <p>5. This whole episode strikes me as very dangerous business indeed and both President
            and I feel we should get to the bottom of it, if possible. It would appear that report
            received by Chancellor represented effort to mislead him intentionally about our
            attitude and we would like to know who was responsible.</p>
                    <p>6. I believe you should call on Kiesinger and tell him that I was dismayed at the
            report which he mentioned to you and <persName corresp="#p_SJR3">Schaetzel</persName>
            and which Casper discussed with Rostow. You can assure him that we know of absolutely no
            grounds for suspicions and that we hope the assurances received via Casper will put his
            mind at rest. It would appear, however, that someone is deliberately trying to harm the
            relations of our two countries and we feel it is important to bring this out in the open
            and find out who is doing it. You could add that if, in the future, there are any rumors
            which could have the effect of dividing us, we should promptly run them down so that we
            can clear the atmosphere of any misunderstandings whatsoever.</p>

            convincing way of reassuring him, I showed him the reftels which he read with interest.
            Although the Chancellor admitted that he had been somewhat disturbed by <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s interview of today in Echo der Zeit (Bonn's
              10062)<note n="4" xml:id="d256fn4">Dated March 26. (Department of State, Central

                E–<gloss target="#t_GER1">GER</gloss> W)</note> which repeated some of the same
            American criticisms of <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> policy, he said that he fully
            accepted the forthright statement made by the Sec and Under Secretary, which confirmed
            what Walther Casper had advised him from Washington following his talks with <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName>.</p>
                    <p>2. The Chancellor said that he agreed with the Sec as to the importance of finding out
            precisely who was responsible for making such false and malicious reports. In this case,
            he did not know the individual involved personally. It was not Duckwitz nor Barzel nor
            Berg nor any of the recent prominent visitors. All he could tell me is that it was a man
            who had been recommended to him by others as having been quite an accurate reporter in
            the past. Predictions he had made in the past had pre-sumably been confirmed by
            subsequent events. He promised that, after he had looked into the matter further, he
            would tell me who the individual is so that we may be forewarned. The Chancellor then
            repeated much of the same ground as I reported in Bonn's 9894, defending himself against
            the accusations allegedly made against him.</p>
                    <p>3. I assured the Chancellor of our desire to trace down and eliminate all possible
            sources of false rumors. I was pleased that he accepted at face value the response which
            the Sec had made. I was sure that he had noted that <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> did not say he was reporting criticisms made by US <pb n="655" xml:id="pg_655" facs="0685"/>Govt officials, but as views which he attributed to the
            American people. Subsequently, in response to the Chancellor's request, I provided him
            with a written paraphrase of the messages from the Sec and the Under Sec.</p>

                        <placeName>Bonn</placeName>, <date when="1968-04-03T18:38:00Z">April 3, 1968,
              1838Z</date>.</dateline>
                    <p>10380. In my first official call on Ministry of Defense State Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HKG1">Von Hase</persName>, on April 1, we spent an hour discussing several
            subjects of current interest:</p>
                    <p>1. Vietnam—<persName corresp="#p_HKG1">Von Hase</persName> made the obvious observation
            that the bombing cessation now puts the matter of negotiation and peace squarely up to
            Hanoi. He alluded to the Stern article re the alleged pronouncements of Vice President
            Ky and indicated interest in what we may discover as to the accuracy with which Ky was
            actually quoted.<note n="2" xml:id="d257fn2">The article, which appeared in the April 7
              issue of Der Stern, pp. 24–25, 251–253, carried the title “Ja, ich bin Korrupt aber
              woher haben denn die Kennedys ihr Geld?” (Sure, I'm corrupt but how did the Kennedys
              make their money?)</note> Separate verification action is underway.</p>
                    <p>2. Stockholm financial meeting—<persName corresp="#p_HKG1">Von Hase</persName>
            indicated that the German Government has no reservations with the conference resolutions
            and the communiqué.</p>
                    <p>3. Neutralization of troop costs—</p>
                    <p>A) German postponement of financial talks—<persName corresp="#p_HKG1">Von
              Hase</persName> was not familiar with the recent delay proposed by the German side. In
            response to my statement that we could not understand it and that if additional
            governmental meetings were required the Embassy stood ready to conduct them. He
            volunteered to inquire into the matter with the Foreign Ministry and advise.</p>
                    <p>B) Long-term solution—Min Schroeder, in a recent speech, alluded to the desirability of
            a “long-term solution” to the problem of neutralization <pb n="656" xml:id="pg_656" facs="0686"/>of troop costs. <persName corresp="#p_HKG1">Von Hase</persName> said that
            Schroeder had no specific solutions in mind; rather, he recognized the disadvantage of
            annual airings of the problem and simply felt it would be to everyone's advantage to
            work out a long-term solution—all of this seemingly with full recognition of the
            necessity of facing the problem of neutralizing our troop costs.</p>
                    <p>4. German procurement decisions—</p>
                    <p>A) Multi-role aircraft 1975 (MRA–75)—Germany needs one strong partner to develop and
            produce the MRA–75 (This is the new title given to the Neues Kampfflugzeug—<gloss target="#t_NKF1">NKF</gloss>). This is necessary because all of the German aircraft
            industry together is to the French aircraft industry as 1:3, to the British 1:6 and to
            the US 1:35. The Germans require this strong partner not only to help in the development
            of the aircraft but also to participate in selling it. The MRA–75 aircraft, being down
            the road, leaves a void in work for the German aircraft industry in the meantime.
            Filling this void is one of the main considerations involved in the F/RF 4 vs. F/RF 104
            “gap filler” decision.</p>
                    <p>B) Aircraft buy decision—Decision on the “gap filler” aircraft is expected in May, with
            Parliamentary deliberations to begin after Easter. Acceding that the F/RF 4 is the best
            aircraft from the military point of view, <persName corresp="#p_HKG1">Von
              Hase</persName> personally obviously leans to the F/RF 104 from the standpoints of
            German industry, politics, logistics and cost.</p>
                    <p>C) Helicopter decision—The Germans have firmly decided that helicopters are required to
            enhance the mobility of their ground forces. Parliamentary deliberations on the
            helicopter decision will go hand in hand with those on the “gap filler” aircraft.</p>
                    <p>D) Pershing 1A—The Germans definitely intend to buy the improved Pershing 1A missile
            system—perhaps not the full 72 but close to it.</p>
                    <p>5. Main battle tank 70—<persName corresp="#p_HKG1">Von Hase</persName> expressed
            satisfaction with the recent main battle tank 70 developments which insure the
            continuation of the joint development program, including the solution to the funding of
            the program. He mentioned the psychological and combat advantages which will accrue if
            our forces who are standing ready side by side in Germany, have the same tanks.</p>
                    <p>6. Forthcoming SecDef/Minister of Defense meeting—<persName corresp="#p_HKG1">Von
              Hase</persName> placed great importance on the two Ministers getting to know one
            another. He agreed that the meeting now being arranged for The Hague should be quite
            informal, a “get acquainted” meeting, however, he is anxious to see the resumption of
            the semi-annual SecDef/Minister of Defense meetings. For the first semi-annual meeting
            with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName> the Germans did not intend to
            be “protocol conscious” and would be quite amenable to conducting it in Washington in
            consideration of plans for Secy <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName>'s
            present responsibilities. He hoped that the plans for the first of <pb n="657" xml:id="pg_657" facs="0687"/>these semi-annual meetings could be firmed at the
            Ministers meeting in The Hague.</p>
                    <p>7. Mutual force reductions—<persName corresp="#p_HKG1">Von Hase</persName> affirmed
            that the Germans continue to have a keen interest in the general subject of mutual force
            reductions. They tend to look on our troop rotation as “advance reductions”—to eventual
            mutual force reductions. He agreed that such actions create a rationale for the Soviets
            to take comparable actions. There is a German group under the chairmanship of Gen
            Heusinger studying this subject. <persName corresp="#p_HKG1">Von Hase</persName>
            promised to provide us with a summary of their conclusions up to this point.</p>

                    <p>Dear Mr. Secretary:</p>
                    <p>You will recall that we have submitted in airgram form analyses of German relations
            with France and with England, of Germany's Eastern policy and of the problem of
            reunification. I am now enclosing for your information the final analysis in this
            series, this one devoted to our own relations with the Federal Republic.<note n="2" xml:id="d258fn2">Not printed. It was entitled “Principal Issues in US-German
              Relations,” and transmitted as airgram A–1207 from Bonn, April 11. (Ibid.)</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>On the whole, our analysis is an optimistic one. We conclude that there is no conflict
            in German and American interests now or in the foreseeable future. The problems and
            tactical objectives of the Federal Republic have shifted in order to meet the changing
            circumstances of the late sixties, including the increase in the Federal Republic's own
            influence and importance. We have had to take this in account in American policy, and it
            is our conclusion that, generally speaking, this has been successfully accomplished. We
            have recognized sensitive areas in our relations and have eliminated the most direct
            causes of contention.</p>
                    <pb n="658" xml:id="pg_658" facs="0688"/>
                    <p>We also conclude, however, that there has been some deterioration of the American image
            in Germany which has begun to alter the nature and extent of American influence. The
            major causes of this are Viet- Nam, the social unrest in America and our balance of
            payments problem. On the German side, while the political situation is stable, there has
            been an increase in radicalism both on the right and on the left, and both exploit
            anti-Americanism. We believe nonetheless that we can have confidence in the future of
            our relations as an important factor in the stability and security of the western
            community. What we need is to keep in the closest possible contact with the Germans at
            all levels to ensure that our policies are mutually understood, and to be willing to
            adjust our concepts of European security and European economic and political
            organization to those developed by the Germans, in cooperation with the other Europeans,
            insofar as these do not genuinely prejudice essential American interests.</p>
                    <p>I hope that you will find time to read the airgram in its entirety, since US-German
            relations are, and will continue to be, of such central importance to the success of
            American foreign policy. I am also sending copies, as I have of the other airgrams, to
            Nick Katzenbach, Gene Rostow, <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">John Leddy</persName>, and in
            the field, to <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">David Bruce</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_CH4">Harlan Cleveland</persName>, and to Woody Wallner in Paris.</p>

                    <p>11203. Subject: <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> interference with Berlin access.
            Ref: Bonn 11159; Bonn 11202.<note n="2" xml:id="d259fn2">Telegram 11159 from Bonn, April
              23, reported three instances of East German interference with access to Berlin.
              (Ibid.) Telegram 11202 from Bonn, April 24, reported on the German presentation to the
              Quadripartite meeting regarding access. (Ibid.)</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>1. I am convinced that the succession of East German measures aimed at interfering with
            German access to Berlin poses a serious challenge <pb n="659" xml:id="pg_659" facs="0689"/>which we must meet. Otherwise the East Germans will be encouraged to
            escalate their pressure on West Berlin and, as <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>
            Brandt has stressed, the psychological effect in West Berlin could jeopardize the city's
            viability.</p>
                    <p>2. It seems to me that we face two requirements. First, we must show sufficient public
            reaction to prove that the three Allies and the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> are
            actively defending free access. Otherwise there will be increasing media
            criticism—particularly if instances of access denial recur—and the United States in
            particular will be singled out for refusing to take a firm position with the Sovs
            concerning Berlin for fear of prejudicing our relations with the Sovs in other areas.
            Publicized protests however will not be effective unless accompanied by effective
            measures designed to persuade the Sovs and the East Germans to bring about cessation of
            access harassment.</p>
                    <p>3. With this in mind we are proposing the following steps in a Quadripartite meeting
            this afternoon<note n="3" xml:id="d259fn3">The Embassy reported on the meeting in
              telegram 11259 from Bonn, April 25. (Ibid.) A statement by the three powers was
              released following the meeting. The text was transmitted in telegram 11338 from Bonn,
              April 26. (Ibid.) Subsequently, the three Ambassadors addressed a letter of protest to
                <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName>. The text of this letter was
              transmitted in telegram 11339 from Bonn, March 26. (Ibid.) The Mission in Berlin
              reported on its démarche to the Soviets in telegram 1352, March 29. (Ibid.)</note> in
            the hope of achieving agreement on recommendations to be made to capitals for
            approval:</p>
                    <p>A. In order to clarify the policy being followed by the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> should arrange for several probes
            in which <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> officials of varying ranks should attempt
            to drive to or from Berlin.</p>
                    <p>B. A formal protest should be drafted from the three Ambs to <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> covering the specific instances which can be
            documented of persons denied surface access to Berlin as the result of the latest East
            German order.</p>
                    <p>C. In accordance with <persName corresp="#p_RHH1">Ruete</persName>'s suggestion, the
            American Amb in Moscow should make a quiet approach to the Sov Govt in behalf of the
            three Allies pointing to various recent steps taken by East German authorities such as
            the ban on <gloss target="#t_NPD1">NPD</gloss> travel, the East German citizenship law
            and the present ban on <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> official travel, noting that
            a certain escalation of East German pressure is apparent and emphasizing the seriousness
            with which we view these developments. He could inquire what the Soviet intentions with
            regard to Berlin are, noting that in our view nothing is to be gained by an increase in
            tension in connection with the city.</p>
                    <p>D. Agreement should be reached among the three Allies and the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> on countermeasures against the East German harassments. A list should be
            prepared which must include German as well as Allied and <pb n="660" xml:id="pg_660" facs="0690"/>
                        <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>-wide counteractions, since otherwise the required
            Allied cooperations cannot be expected.</p>
                    <p>E. As soon as agreement is reached on such a list <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
            should be briefed in detail on the Quadripartite assessment of the threat to free Berlin
            access and on the various actions, including countermeasures, taken or proposed by the
            three powers and the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. If increased <gloss target="#t_TTD1">TTD</gloss> restrictions are proposed, <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> agreement on this will be sought. In <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> the German Rep might be given the responsibility for the general
            presentation.</p>
                    <p>4. The recommendation for a further protest to <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> is not in accord with the thinking expressed by <persName corresp="#p_RHH1">Ruete</persName> yesterday (first reftel). However, I am convinced
            that some further publicized move by the three Allies will be required to meet press
            criticism here and eventually in the US alleging an inadequate Tripartite response.</p>
                    <p>5. In the event that the British or French do not wish to go along with a quiet
            approach in Moscow I believe that we should give serious thought to a unilateral US
            démarche. We shall [have] further recommendations on this when the outcome of today's
            meeting is known. In the meantime I have just learned that I will be seeing Abrasimov
            for a final call on May 3. I would expect to use this occasion to raise the access issue
            with <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName>. This conversation could be
            publicized or kept confidential, depending on the circumstances at the time and

                259</ref>.</note> While I am quite prepared to wade in with the Soviets here on
              <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> interference with Berlin access, it seems to me
            this should be last step and not <pb n="661" xml:id="pg_661" facs="0691"/>the first,
            since this involves serious confrontation of two great powers and directly engages
            Soviet prestige. It seems to me it is typical of Federal Republic always to expect us to
            take action while such matters as interzonal trade are kept sacrosanct. If we are to be
            successful in facing down East Germans on this issue, we must find some means of
            retaliation which really hurts them. While restriction on TTDs is useful, I doubt that
            this is enough unless we stop issuing any until this issue is resolved. As minimum I
            should think that before any action taken here, we should have firm agreement on what
            our next step should be if Soviets ignore our protest. We have a certain amount of
            capital here but constant tendency to run to Soviets on every issue diminishes
            effectiveness of each subsequent démarche. I would therefore urge that Federal Republic
            be made to face up to this issue. I strongly suspect that Soviets tend to ride with
            punch under pressure from East Germans unless or until Federal Republic and Allies show
            that East German action is not in interest of Eastern powers.<note n="3" xml:id="d260fn3">In telegram 153417, April 26, the Department of State indicated its

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. Germany in Perspective</p>
                    <p>The advent of the present Bonn Government in December 1966 marks a turning point in
            German-American relations. The Adenauer-Erhard years were years of German dependence
            upon the United States, with the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> accepting U.S.
            tutelage in return for our security guarantees and our support for German efforts to
            rebuild a prosperous and respected nation. The fall of Erhard late in 1966, and the
            creation of the Kiesinger-Brandt government, signalled the evolution of German policy
            toward greater emphasis on the pursuit of reunification of their divided nation. The
            relative absence of crisis in Europe and the public belief that Soviet aggression had
            become somewhat less likely; the growth of a détente psychology; the passage of years
            since 1945 and the erosion of the post-war fears and sense of guilt; <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>'s rekindling of nationalism first in France and
            then elsewhere in Europe; all contributed to a greater German sense of independence from
            tutelage, and more active efforts to lay the groundwork for eventual reunification. In
            Germany, however, this has taken place without serious strain on <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> ties with <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, and without rupturing
            cooperation and partnership with the <pb n="663" xml:id="pg_663" facs="0693"/>U.S.
              <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and the U.S. are still regarded in Germany as
            the basis of security on which German efforts to pursue reunification rest.</p>
                    <p>The Kiesinger-Brandt government's main single policy innovation has been the pursuit of
            a more flexible Eastern policy aimed at opening a dialogue with the Soviet Union,
            improving relations with the Eastern European states, and seeking to extend the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>'s ties with East Germany (short of recognition). The
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> regards improved relations with the East as a
            contribution to European peace and stability; but, at least equally important, it is a
            necessary prelude to progress toward reunification. The results of this policy up to now
            have been modest. This is not surprising. The German leaders have been aware that they
            are pursuing difficult and long-range goals with their Eastern policy, and that results
            will be slow at best.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. U.S. Policy Objectives</p>
                    <p>We seek, in the framework of a stable and secure European community, a friendly unified
            peaceful and democratic Germany. With these goals in mind, our specific objectives are
            to 1) maintain the excellent and confident bilateral relations we enjoy with the Federal
            Republic at all levels; 2) encourage continuing German support of European integration;
            3) promote continuing German confidence and participation in maintaining the security of
            the West within the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> framework; 4) promote German
            cooperation in meeting global economic and financial problems; 5) assure the continued
            freedom and viability of Berlin; and 6) help promote the eventual peaceful reunification
            of Germany.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">III. Problem Areas</p>
                    <p>A. <hi rend="italic">Berlin</hi>—Our policy is to seek to preserve access to the city;
            maintain the confidence of the Berliners in our ability to keep the city free; and
            maintain Allied solidarity to the degree possible in the face of serious problems with
            France in matters external to Berlin but occasionally affecting Berlin directly. We must
            assure that our relations with Berlin officials are kept harmonious; and support the
            principle of close political and economic relations between Berlin and the Federal
            Republic but avoid allowing serious confrontations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> over Berlin to develop, as far as this can be done without abandoning
            our responsibilities and rights.</p>
                    <p>The Soviets have given the East German regime a certain amount of latitude on Berlin
            access matters. On March 10, the East Germans issued a “decree” banning members of the
            right-radical <gloss target="#t_NPD1">NPD</gloss> party of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> from traveling to and from Berlin. This was followed on April 13 by a ban
            on the travel of <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> cabinet members and other high
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> officials through East Germany. The Three Allies
            (U.S., U.K. and France) protested this action in a statement delivered to the Soviet
            Embassy in East Berlin on April 19. To date, there are only three confirmed cases of
              <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
                        <pb n="664" xml:id="pg_664" facs="0694"/>authorities turning back <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> officials on the basis of this ban. Two were relatively
            minor officials; the third was the Governing Mayor of Berlin, <persName corresp="#p_SK4">Klaus Schuetz</persName>, who is also currently President of the
            Bundesrat (Federal Council), the upper house of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
            parliament this month. <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials indicated that it
            was the latter position that resulted in the refusal to let Schuetz travel on the
            Berlin-Helmstedt autobahn to the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> on April 26.</p>
                    <p>Identical letters protesting the illegality of this <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
            interference with Berlin access were sent to the Soviet Ambassador in East Berlin by the
            three Allied Ambassadors in Bonn. These letters reminded the Soviets of their
            responsibility to provide access. <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> has been briefed
            on the situation and the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> has proposed a series of
            diplomatic countermeasures to try to force the Soviets to tighten the reins on the
              <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. The possibility of trade and travel restrictions
            on the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> is also being studied by the three Protective
            Powers and the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The motives of the Soviet Union and the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> in stirring
            up the Berlin access problem right now seem to include the following:</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">The East Germans</hi> are becoming increasingly isolated even
            within the Soviet bloc. In addition, they are pretty thoroughly isolated from the major
            international trends and activities of the day (e.g., they are absent from the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> debate in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>; they
            view with alarm the trend toward liberalization in some parts of the Soviet bloc and the
            first small steps now being taken to bring together the two parts of Europe). One of the
            few ways available to Ulbricht to exercise leverage on both his friends and his
            adversaries is the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>'s de facto hold on German ground
            access to Berlin. He is now using this to show everyone that the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> is still around and has to be reckoned with. For the longer range, the
            East German regime may also hope that it can gradually, by salami tactics, assert an
            increasing degree of access control, reduce the free flow of traffic, and strangle West
            Berlin.</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">The Russians</hi> may wish to use Berlin frictions as a way of
            maintaining their hold on the increasingly restive East European countries. They may
            also be willing to let the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> demonstrate to Bonn one
            side of the stick and carrot technique (Tsarapkin's willingness to talk with Brandt
            about non-aggression pacts being the “carrot”). Finally, it is not unlikely that the
              <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> initiated the decrees and access interruptions on
            its own, with the Soviets acquiescing but not pushing the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> into these acts.</p>
                    <p>We will have to see, through quiet diplomatic intercession with the Soviets, whether
            the Soviets can be brought to recognize that some of the objectives they themselves say
            they have in mind for Central Europe (e.g., German acceptance of <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>, avoiding challenge to the status quo there) are put in jeopardy by the
              <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>'s challenge to free German access to Berlin. If we
            can interest the Soviets in this, the result will not be a sudden <pb n="665" xml:id="pg_665" facs="0695"/>retraction by the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>,
            but more probably an unannounced diminution in the number of interruptions and denials
            of access.</p>
                    <p>There will probably be a rescission, without a major crisis, of the immediate problem
            over German officials' access to Berlin, since the Soviet Union retains strong controls
            over the East Germans; has not challenged the Allied regime in West Berlin; and gives no
            indication of wishing to provoke a major confrontation over the issue. The protests
            already made to the Soviet Union have led to some easing of East German interference.
            There are other measures available for use if necessary, including higher-level
            discussions with the Soviets and graduated Western economic countermeasures against East
            Germany.</p>
                    <p>The Berlin problem can probably be solved finally only in the context of a growing
            together of divided Europe of which it is a microcosm. In the meantime, we should use
            the political, diplomatic, and economic means at our disposal to counter threats as they
            arise. These would include engaging the Soviet Union's own interest in not disturbing
            the status quo; East German economic interests and fear of isolation; and a clear
            understanding on our own side of the serious consequences to ourselves if Berlin were
            allowed to die on the vine. The damage to our relations with the Federal Republic; to
            Western confidence in our commitments and resolution; and to Soviet restraint based on
            their respect for our power and determination to protect our European interests, would
            be very great.</p>
                    <p>B. <hi rend="italic">German Reunification and Eastern Policy</hi>—One <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> major foreign policy goal remains the reunification of
            the German people. The Eastern policy of the governing coalition (better relations with
            Moscow, relations short of formal recognition with East Germany and diplomatic relations
            with the Eastern European states) reflects an effort to shake up existing rigidities in
            the hope of developing a climate or, at least opportunities, for ultimate reunification
            steps. No responsible German has a reunification timetable but most politicians are
            convinced that reunification can come about in some fashion. The leaders of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> know that at best it will be a slow process, and they
            will have to be patient.</p>
                    <p>Relations have been established with Romania and reestablished with Yugoslavia. The
            Czechs, treading cautiously to avoid Soviet reaction to their internal liberalization,
            will probably delay establishing diplomatic relations with Germany for a year or two,
            but closer economic ties are probable. Barring unforeseen circumstances flowing from the
            present turmoil in Poland,<note n="2" xml:id="d262fn2">Reference is to anti-Semitic
              demonstrations orchestrated by the “Partisan” faction of the Polish Communist Party
              that began in March.</note> the Poles can be expected to resist <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> blandishments longer than the others. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will resist any increase of German influence in Eastern
            Europe, but eventually may try to weaken <pb n="666" xml:id="pg_666" facs="0696"/>German
            ties with the West, using German desire for reunification as bait. For the foreseeable
            future, however, the Soviets will not allow the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> to
            be absorbed by the Federal Republic, nor is the Federal Republic likely to be seduced
            into abandoning <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>. More probably, we are seeing the beginning of a long process of greater
            interchange and discourse between the two parts of Europe, to which current <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> policy has made an indispensable contribution.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> Eastern policy is consistent with our own. In
            fact, the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> probably was influenced toward greater
            flexibility by the U.S. example. Nevertheless, there has been German sensitivity to the
            U.S. reaction as the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> seeks to open a dialogue with
            the Soviet Union. German press reports, private gossip in Bonn and reports by German
            travelers returning from the U.S., all have been quoted to the effect that the U.S. is
            worried that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> is too accommodating toward the
            East, talking with the Russians behind our backs, etc.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">The U.S. Position</hi>—The highest U.S. officials have assured the
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> time and again that we think German Eastern policy
            is wise, and that we understand and sympathize with it. We will have to show patience
            and sympathetic understanding on this score for some time to come. At the same time, we
            have a right to expect the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> to keep us fully informed
            about their conversations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>C. <hi rend="italic">Non-Proliferation Treaty</hi> (<gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>)—Beginning in January, 1967, we have conducted hundreds of consultations
            with the Germans about the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>. The Germans have had
            some serious objections to the Treaty text, most of which have been met. Essentially,
            however, they remain lukewarm. For one reason, they feel that the Soviets want it
            primarily to hurt German security; the Germans in turn don't like to make this kind of
            commitment to their enemies (a commitment they did not mind making in 1954 to their
              <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Allies). Many Germans feel they will have to
            sign the Treaty. This realization does not make them any happier. Brandt's <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss>, in general, advises adherence; Kiesinger's <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> is either opposed or lukewarm. Principal opponents of the
            Treaty include the leader of the Bavarian wing of the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>, the <gloss target="#t_CSU1">CSU</gloss>—<persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Franz Josef Strauss</persName>.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">The U.S. Position</hi>—We believe the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> should adhere to the Treaty both because the Treaty is valuable in itself
            and because <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> policy objectives in relations with
            other Western nations and with Eastern Europe would suffer if the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> impedes or rejects the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>D. <hi rend="italic">European Security Questions</hi>—When the Chancellor speaks of the
            future of Europe, we know he is not thinking of a Europe which would in any way be
            hostile to the United States. He foresees our acting together in friendly agreement.
            Beyond that, it is less clear what he has in mind. It does seem, however, that the
            Germans today prefer a Europe related to the U.S. in a partnership of equals rather than
            in what used to be called the Atlantic Community framework.</p>
                    <pb n="667" xml:id="pg_667" facs="0697"/>
                    <p>Although the Germans sense that European arrangements are presently in flux, they
            continue to rely on <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> as the surest guarantee of
            German survival, at least under foreseeable circumstances. They recognize that the U.S.
            with 200,000 men in Germany and its nuclear capacity is the best guarantor of German
            security. At the same time, they are aware of our need to neutralize foreign exchange
            losses incurred by stationing our troops and their dependents in Germany. Between 1961
            and 1966 the German Government purchased military equipment here in the amount of
            $600–$700 million annually. In 1966, the Germans no longer found it possible to make
            military purchases of the previous magnitude. The current arrangement (German purchase
            of $500 million worth of medium-term Treasury securities) expires June 30. US/<gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> talks in Washington May 9 and 10 resulted in an impasse.
            The German offer to continue cost neutralization for one year at the $500 million level
            was unacceptable to us in view of the anticipated net foreign exchange loss of about
            $770 million. We pointed out the seriousness of our balance of payments situation,
            congressional pressure for troop reductions, and the favorable <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> balance of payments position. There was, however, no give in the German
            position. The talks were adjourned for two or three weeks to permit the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> to review the matter with the Bundesbank and in the
            Cabinet. We still expect to achieve agreement.</p>
                    <p>E. <hi rend="italic">International Monetary Problems</hi>—The strong measures announced
            at the end of the year by the President to correct our balance of payments problems and
            to control American investment overseas were accepted by the FRG as a welcome step,
            although there is concern that we may adopt additional restrictive trade measures. To
            counter the need for US restrictive measures, the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
            has proposed European concessions in Brussels to encourage US exports. In Washington
            during gold discussions and later at Stockholm the Germans have been very helpful in
            maintaining the international monetary system.</p>
                    <p>F. <hi rend="italic">Relations with France</hi>—The relationship with France is
            important for the Federal Republic because a) rapprochement with France has wide popular
            appeal; b) the Franco-German tie is necessary for progress toward a more united Europe,
            eventually; c) association with France may help German efforts in Eastern Europe. The
            promise of closer ties with France was a key policy plank of the coalition (in contrast
            to <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s alleged neglect to this
            relationship).</p>
                    <p>The above considerations sometimes put the Germans in positions where they come
            perilously close to having to choose between their basic security interests (<gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss>) and their
            relations with France. This is a choice which the Germans assiduously avoid.
            Nevertheless from time to time the Germans publicly disagree with the French on issues
            such as: 1) unity with the United States and others in Stockholm on the two prices for
            gold and the additional drawing rights; 2) continued need for <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        <pb n="668" xml:id="pg_668" facs="0698"/>protection and specifically United States
            protection at a time when France has withdrawn from the Alliance in all but name; 3)
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> desire to expand the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> to include the United Kingdom. The Germans in fact seek to maintain a
            friendly tone in their relations with France while disagreeing with many major elements
            of French policy.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">U.S. Policy</hi>—We should continue to express understanding for
            German desires for good relations with France. At the same time, we expect the Germans
            to keep the United States fully informed of any Franco-German agreements or planning
            that affect our interests and security arrangements.</p>
                    <p>G. <hi rend="italic">Political Extremism</hi>—Political stability under a democratic
            government is clearly a primary American objective in Germany. As if recognizing this,
            the radical movements of both the right and left share a virulent anti-Americanism. The
            extreme right, represented by the National Democratic Party (<gloss target="#t_NPD1">NPD</gloss>), is now seated in all but two of the German state parliaments. It had
            its greatest victory in Baden-Wuerttemberg on April 28 with almost 10 percent of the
            vote. It is likely to gain Bundestag representation in 1969. Although it may not grow
            much more, its major importance is that the major parties may during the 1969 elections
            try to pre-empt some <gloss target="#t_NPD1">NPD</gloss> attitudes in order to attract
            voters. Furthermore, <gloss target="#t_NPD1">NPD</gloss> growth causes public uneasiness
            in other countries, including the United States and other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> members, and has been and will be exploited by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in savage propaganda attacks against the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. Left-wing anti-Americanism has found little echo among
            the population except with respect to the war in Viet-Nam, which has been exploited as
            an issue by left-wing elements.</p>
                    <p>There has been some concern expressed in Eastern and Western Europe that the recent
            growth of the <gloss target="#t_NPD1">NPD</gloss> may mean that Germany could repeat the
            process by which the Nazis came to power in 1933. It is important to bear in mind that
            there are fundamental differences in conditions now: the German economy is now strong;
            Germany is now no longer politically adrift and alone in a hostile Europe; it is no
            longer potentially the strongest military and industrial power on the entire continent;
            its people have been through the experience of Nazism once, and except for the ten
            percent fringe (which Germany has in common with many other countries), the German
            people have not shown an inclination to repeat that tragedy.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">U.S. Posture</hi>—We can do very little directly about right
            radicalism in Germany. We should (a) recognize that 90 percent of the electorate has
            consistently voted against the <gloss target="#t_NPD1">NPD</gloss>; (b) avoid official
            public comment on what is after all an internal political matter; (c) be aware that the
              <gloss target="#t_NPD1">NPD</gloss> is fed by the absence of any other means for
            registering strong protest on election day; and (d) see that frustration in the pursuit
            of legitimate German national aims feeds nationalist extremism. Basically this is a
            problem <pb n="669" xml:id="pg_669" facs="0699"/>the Germans will have to meet
            themselves. Sharply aware of their past history, the Germans know perfectly well from
            the press alone what the outside world thinks of the <gloss target="#t_NPD1">NPD</gloss>. Official public comment from abroad only feeds extremists.</p>
                    <p>To the degree that U.S. policies contribute to general economic soundness in Europe,
            intra-European cooperation in which Germany participates, and to an evolution that gives
            hope for progress toward the healing of the division of Germany, we will contribute to
            conditions that make highly unlikely the emergence of extremist groups as serious
            contenders for power in the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>.</p>

                <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> left post on May 21 and entered on

              credentials on May 27.</note> on All-German Affairs Min Wehner on May 7 was Berlin
            access and related questions.</p>
                    <p>1. I gave Wehner a brief review of my conversation with Sov Amb to the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> Abrasimov on May 3.<note n="3" xml:id="d263fn3">Reported
              in telegram 1396 from Berlin, May 3. (Department of State, Central Files, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 17 <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_GER1">GER</gloss> E) <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName>
              commented on the meeting in telegram 1399 from Berlin, May 4. (Ibid.)</note> I had
            pointed out to <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> that recent <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> actions restricting access injected new tensions into a
            situation which had remained calm for the past three years. It represented an attempt to
            upset the status quo. I said that <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> had
            taken the position that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had always protested
            meetings of Bundestag committees in Berlin and other actions on the part of the FedRep
            tending to create the impression that Berlin was being treated as a Land of the FedRep.
            Therefore this could not be considered as part of the status quo. <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> had hinted that if the Fed Govt were to
            publicly announce their curtailment of these activities, the Sovs would prevail upon the
              <pb n="670" xml:id="pg_670" facs="0700"/>
                        <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> to rescind access restrictions. I had told <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> that I did not see any basis in his proposal
            for a bargain.</p>
                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_WH6">Wehner</persName> expressed appreciation for the position
            which I had taken. He agreed with my contention that Allied protests are not mere paper
            measures, but undoubtedly had some effect on the Soviet Union. As evidence he cited two
            recent lengthy articles in Pravda and Izvestia which took unusual and elaborate pains to
            relate access restrictions to the Potsdam Agreement. <persName corresp="#p_WH6">Wehner</persName> suggested that these articles should be closely studied. He was
            inclined to think that the Sovs, as a result of Allied protests, now felt it necessary
            to justify their position on the basis of the Potsdam Agreement.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_WH6">Wehner</persName> said that Brandt had reported that the
            possibility of protest in Moscow was also under study. I confirmed this. I also told
              <persName corresp="#p_WH6">Wehner</persName> that countermeasures were being studied
            quadripartitely. If any were instituted, it would have to be by Quadripartite agreement
            and all, including the FedRep, would have to participate. Wehner agreed with this
            position.</p>
                    <p>4. I asked whether he had any suggestions as to what should be done next. Was he in
            favor of probes to determine the extent of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
            measures? Wehner said that he was. He said that German civil servants had instructions
            to proceed as usual in traveling to Berlin. This involved of course the risk and
            inconvenience of being turned back at the checkpoint and having to continue by air. It
            was felt, however, that probes of this nature are necessary.</p>
                    <p>5. The Arndt-Behrendt exchange. Wehner then read from a memcon prepared by
            Parliamentary State Sec Arndt on his conversation with Behrendt (<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> Deputy Foreign Trade Min) at the Hannoverfair on May 1. He promised to
            make a copy of this memo available to us.<note n="4" xml:id="d263fn4">The memorandum of
              conversation was forwarded in telegram 11795 from Bonn, May 9. (Department of State,
              Central Files, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 28 <gloss target="#t_GER1">GER</gloss> B)</note> From this conversation it appeared that the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> was sensitive to hints that access restrictions might
            affect interzonal trade. Behrendt took pains in pointing out that none of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> measures affected interzonal trade and that Pollak (the
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> interzonal trade negotiator) would be free to
            travel to Berlin by surface means.</p>
                    <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName>'s Trier visit. <persName corresp="#p_WH6">Wehner</persName> said that the govt was paying close attention to
            two instances which constituted interference in West German internal affairs. One was
            Amb <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName>'s visit to Trier where, instead of
            attending the official <persName>Karl Marx</persName> celebrations, he visited the
            meeting organized by the leftist opposition. The Chancellor had instructed FonMin Brandt
            to make a suitable protest to <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName> about
            this visit.</p>
                    <pb n="671" xml:id="pg_671" facs="0701"/>
                    <p>7. Special train carrying demonstrators. The other question concerned the special
            Reichsbahn train which would carry demonstrators to the May 11 protest meeting in Bonn
            from Berlin. This problem was still occupying the Cabinet and a final decision has not
            as yet been taken. <persName corresp="#p_WH6">Wehner</persName> said that he had taken
            the position that the govt should refuse permission for the train, at the risk of
            interference with the gymnastic festival in West Berlin which <persName corresp="#p_WH6">Wehner</persName> considered an ill-chosen occasion for a major exertion on the part
            of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. It was however a difficult question to
            decide. The Min of Transport had taken the position that refusal to let the train go
            through might lead to further restrictive measures with regard to Berlin access. It was
            a question of judgment.</p>
                    <p>9. [sic] I agree that it was a difficult question. Permitting this train to go through
            however could set a precedent for similar demands in the future which would amount to
            permanent interference in internal German affairs. There was here a parallel to the
            offer by East German authorities to permit the <gloss target="#t_SDS1">SDS</gloss> to
            demonstrate on the Autobahn. Wehner agreed.</p>
                    <p>10. Possible visit to the US. In conclusion, I told <persName corresp="#p_WH6">Wehner</persName> that I had greatly valued my association with him. I had admired
            the energy with which he had attempted to bring motion into the German problem.
              <persName corresp="#p_WH6">Wehner</persName> responded warmly. When I expressed the
            hope that he would undertake a visit to the US, <persName corresp="#p_WH6">Wehner</persName> smiled and said that the chances for such a trip decreased as
            election results became worse (this was the only reference during the conversation to
            the defeat suffered by the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> in Baden-Wuerttemberg).
            He added that he had talked to Amb <persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName> at
            the foreign policy conclave chaired by Chancellor Kiesinger last weekend, and that
              <persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName> had urged him also to visit the US. I
            gained the impression that <persName corresp="#p_WH6">Wehner</persName> might, after
            all, undertake such a visit if a suitable occasion were found. I would consider this
            highly desirable and hope it will be followed up.</p>

            undertake probes (para 5 reftel). Would prefer to allow German travel to Berlin to
            develop normally; this will bring to light <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
            interference with access in any event but would reduce risk of friction among the four
            western countries, imputations of blame, etc., if deliberate probe should lead to
            difficulties.</p>
                    <p>2. We share Ambassador's view that politically inspired efforts to dramatize
            Berlin-Bonn ties (para 6 reftel) are inopportune but Department reluctant to reproach
            Germans on them for the time being. Our motives might easily be misinterpreted, and we
            would not wish Berlin access problems to become a source of friction and
            misunderstanding between the FRG and ourselves.</p>
                    <p>3. We understand that <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> authorities are not planning
            to resume Bundestag plenary meetings or Defense Committee meetings in Berlin, which we
            agree should be avoided. Dept would appreciate any information that Embassy may obtain
            that would indicate any changes in <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> plans in these

              11526.<note n="2" xml:id="d265fn2">Telegram 12007 from Bonn, May 13, was a situation
              report on East German activities. (Department of State, Central Files, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 28 <gloss target="#t_GER1">GER</gloss> B) In telegram
              164087, May 14, the Department of State instructed the Embassy that if the issue of
                Brandt-<persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName> talks was raised by the
              Germans it should state that the United States had no objection to the discussions.
              (Ibid.) In telegram 11526 from Bonn, May 1, the Embassy reported on discussions with
              German officials regarding Berlin access. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss>
              38–6)</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>1. The Embassy's view is that it would be unwise for Brandt to get into the specifics
            of Berlin access with <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName>, even German
            access. The Germans' right of access is inextricably if implicitly bound up with the
            Allies' rights and with the responsibilities of the Four Powers. It is because this is
            true that the Allies are in a position to direct their approaches to the Soviets when
            there is interference with German travel to and from Berlin. A German-Soviet dialogue on
            access, outside the traditional Quadripartite framework which the Soviets continue to
            accept, might render it more difficult for us to approach the Soviets in future cases of
            interference with German access. It was this reasoning which led us in reftel (C) to
            suggest that it would not be appropriate to have Brandt's discussion with <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName> extend into matters which are an Allied
            responsibility.</p>
                    <p>2. The Germans do not seem inclined at the moment to have Brandt pursue the matter with
              <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName>. They have not informed us that a
            meeting between the two has been scheduled. They have not indicated that they
            contemplate any further responses of their own in the access field soon.</p>
                    <p>3. However, the British Embassy (Gladstone) told us today that London felt a
            contingency plan should be developed, which would permit a swift Allied response in the
            event the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> published a new travel decree or again
            interfered with German access to Berlin in the next few weeks. Gladstone said the
            British Minister in Washington had discussed this idea with the Department last week.
            Essentially what London had in mind was agreeing in advance that at a specified time
            after some new <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> access interference, the three Allies
            would proceed to deliver an oral démarche in Moscow. The three governments might also
            agree in advance to signal their displeasure directly to the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, perhaps in the <pb n="674" xml:id="pg_674" facs="0704"/>form of a
            warning to the East German travel bureau about a possible slow down in <gloss target="#t_TTD1">TTD</gloss> issuances. The British had no fixed ideas as to the
            details of this contingency plan but felt something along these lines would help us
            avoid having to go through the usual cycle of a press statement and protest to <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName>. We indicated that this idea had merit and that
            we would be willing, subject to any Departmental comments, to work out the details of
            such a plan at our next Tripartite meeting in Bonn on May 21.<note n="3" xml:id="d265fn3">In telegram 166762, May 16, the Department of State replied that it
              saw merit in the idea of having Brandt warn the Soviets that “further <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> trouble making around Berlin would jeopardize a
              fruitful German-Soviet dialogue on matters of broader interest.” (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 28 <gloss target="#t_GER1">GER</gloss> B)</note>

                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Kiesinger</hi>. In my last meeting with Chancellor Kiesinger, he
            asked me to convey to you his warm greetings and to assure you that he still felt <pb n="676" xml:id="pg_676" facs="0706"/>as he had expressed himself to you in Washington
            last August. As he wrote you,<note n="2" xml:id="d267fn2">A copy of the Kiesinger letter
              is in Department of State, Presidential Correspondence: Lot 71 D 370, Germany.</note>
            he considers your decision not to seek a new term as an unselfish act of the highest
            order of statesmanship. In my conversation with him, it developed that his immediate
            concerns are with the current situation in France, both from the standpoint of its
            effect on France as a member of the European Community and insofar as it may induce
            unfavorable reactions in Germany. He is also concerned about the increase of the <gloss target="#t_NPD1">NPD</gloss> vote to ten per cent in the recent Baden Wurtenburg
            elections, and the adverse effect on the stability of the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> as a coalition partner resulting from its corresponding eight per cent
            loss.</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Present Internal Situation</hi>. Despite the <gloss target="#t_NPD1">NPD</gloss> increase and continued student unrest the internal
            situation in Germany remains relatively stable, particularly in comparison with that in
            France and even England. The political storm over the Emergency Law should recede once
            the law is passed. The Grand Coalition, although squeaky, is understood by all to be the
            only viable government available and will continue at least until 1969. Student unrest,
            although troublesome, has not resulted—and should not—in a threat to the government as
            in France. The greatest threat is that it may produce a right wing reaction. Most
            important, the workers have refused a linkage of their objectives with those of the
            students, and the labor unions remain conservative and stable and do not threaten
            strikes. The German economy is moving forward satisfactorily at a rate of five per cent
            annual increase in <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss>, and unemployment has been
            reduced to manageable proportions. Germany has found itself, increasingly, as a pivotal
            country in European and world decisions—such as monetary reform, <gloss target="#t_KR1">KR</gloss> acceleration, and British entry. There is, however, an underlying
            apprehension largely arising from uncertainties in the general world situation.</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">U.S./German Relations</hi>. U.S./German relations are on the whole
            quite satisfactory. Although there is a strong anti-Viet-Nam sentiment among the youth,
            this has not resulted in any appreciable overall anti-Americanism. We still have a
            reservoir of good will among the German people and strong support among government and
            party leaders. Germany, being a country in unstable international equilibrium, must
            “lean” on other countries. With increasing evidence of French internal weakness, there
            should be a tendency to shift toward greater dependence on the U.S.—particularly the
            American security guarantee and the continued high level of U.S. forces in Germany. The
            creation of a Popular Front Government in France would produce a feeling of
            “encirclement” in Germany, which would require special reassurances from us. At the same
            time Kiesinger will continue to show that he is capable of pursuing <pb n="677" xml:id="pg_677" facs="0707"/>an independent policy, which first takes into account
            German interests. He will continue to seek greater freedom for maneuver in the face of
            rapidly changing circumstances. He will continue, in a pragmatic way but with little
            hope of a real breakthrough, to press for progress in German Eastern Policy.</p>

            The Germans are reluctantly drawn along by the course of events toward the signing of

            U.S. interpretations of ambiguities in the treaty and Soviet reactions.</p>
                    <p>(b) <hi rend="italic">Offset</hi>. We are in the final stage in the negotiations for an
            Offset Agreement for the next fiscal year. In my judgment, the 250 million dollar
            difference remaining between us can only be settled by a “splitting of the difference”
            approach—involving concessions by both sides. In my last meeting with him, I urged
            Kiesinger that the Germans better their current offer.</p>
                    <p>(c) <hi rend="italic">Troop Levels</hi>. The Germans remain sensitive to possible
            further decreases in U.S. troop levels. Reductions beyond the limited deployment now
            under way should be avoided if at all possible—and assurances to this effect
            given—although this need not preclude savings in “non-combat” activities.</p>
                    <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Future U.S. Approach</hi>. We should continue to maintain and
            strengthen our ties with Germany as perhaps the most stable and potentially influential
            free world country, through full and early consultation—as an equal. We should be alert
            to and reassuring in regard to well-known German sensitivities.</p>

                    <p>The Department, upon learning yesterday of East German restrictions on travel by West
            German citizens to Berlin through East Germany and to East Germany itself, as well as on
            German freight traffic to West Berlin, convened the Berlin Task Force. The Berlin Task
            Force was formed in response to President <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName>'s request in 1961 to meet Soviet threats at that time to sign a
            separate peace treaty with East Germany. The Berlin Task Force, with representatives of
            State, <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and USIA
            attending, examined a draft tripartite statement forwarded by Embassy Bonn. The Embassy
            had met with the British, French and Germans last night to consider how to deal with the
            situation created by the East German measures. The Task Force agreed to recommend to the
            Secretary that Bonn be authorized to discuss with the British and French an amended text
            to be issued after we have received further German plans on how to deal with the
            situation and you have given your approval to the final draft.</p>
                    <p>Final agreement on the draft has now been reached and you have given your approval. We
            expect the Three Embassies in Bonn to issue the statement tonight.<note n="2" xml:id="d268fn2">For text, see Documents on Germany, 1944–1985, p. 1009.</note>

                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_USIB1">USIB</gloss> Watch Committee this morning considered the
            Berlin problem and concluded that no Soviet or East German military measures relevant to
            the Berlin problem have been observed thus far.</p>
                    <p>The German Cabinet was called into session at 9 O'clock this morning and at the time of
            writing had met for more than four hours. Foreign Minister Brandt cut short his trip to
            Vienna and Belgrade to return for the Cabinet session. The Chancellor saw Ambassador
              <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> this evening and told him he regards the
            situation as serious.<note n="3" xml:id="d268fn3">See <ref target="#d269">Document
                269</ref>.</note> He said that it was important that responsible and realistic steps
            be taken. The Chancellor feels that the Three Protective Powers should take the matter
            up with the Soviet Union in the first instance, before the Germans do so, because it is
            a Quadripartite Agreement (to which the Germans are not a party) that is being violated
            by the Russians. Further steps that might be taken are under urgent study here and in
            Bonn. The Germans know we will expect them to do their share.</p>
                    <pb n="679" xml:id="pg_679" facs="0709"/>
                    <p>The German Chancellor has also announced that he plans to go to Berlin tomorrow. While
            the trip is billed as an “information trip” its purpose is obviously to buck up Berlin
            morale.</p>
                    <p>The East German measures, almost certainly undertaken with Soviet agreement, are
            designed to underscore further East German claims to sovereignty. Soviet agreement for
            the imposition of visa requirements by the Ulbricht regime probably was obtained late
            last month, when a high level East German delegation visited there. East German and
            Soviet thinking may be that the greater flexibility among West Germans on the question
            of recognition of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, together with assumed
            difficulties we are having and recent French events, make this an appropriate moment to
            take this step. While the restrictions will not directly affect Allied access to Berlin,
            the East Germans can use them in a great many ways to harass traffic and the flow of
            goods to and from Berlin. West Berlin is almost entirely dependent upon the Federal
            Republic for its existence, and any impairment of this flow would strangle the city.</p>

                    <p>Subj: Meeting with the Chancellor on Berlin access.</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Summary</hi>: During a meeting with the three Allied Ambassadors
            this afternoon, Chancellor Kiesinger termed the East German measures on passports and
            visas a step in a long-prepared plan aimed at a gradual weakening of the status of
            Berlin and at the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. The Soviet Union clearly stands
            behind the measures and is seeking to isolate the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
            and to <pb n="680" xml:id="pg_680" facs="0710"/>divide it from its allies. The new East
            German measures are not aimed only at Berlin and the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
            however but also at the Three Powers. The Chancellor felt that the assessment of the
            seriousness of this development provided in <gloss target="#t_BQD1">BQD</gloss>-CC–28<note n="2" xml:id="d269fn2">Not found.</note> was correct. As
            suggested in that document countermeasures are required and not just protests. The
            Chancellor urged as a first step that the Tripartite public statement be issued by the
            three governments as quickly as possible. The German Government had not reached
            decisions on specific countermeasures which the German and Allied sides should
            undertake. This should be the subject of close Quadripartite consultation. He would
            welcome démarches by the three Foreign Mins with the respective Sov Ambassadors. The
            three Ambassadors expressed on a personal basis general agreement with the Chancellor's
            assessment of the situation and said that their governments would wish to consult
            closely in order to find the right response to the East German steps. End summary.</p>
                    <p>1. Chancellor Kiesinger met with the three Western Ambassadors for an hour this
            afternoon to discuss the East German passport and visa requirements. Also present on the
            German side were State Secs <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_GKTF1">Guttenberg</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DGF3">Duckwitz</persName>. The Chancellor first said that he would go to Berlin tomorrow to
            meet with Governing Mayor Schuetz for a discussion of the situation. He will not follow
            Schuetz's suggestion that he take part in a Senat meeting since he does not wish to
            provide the East Germans with any pretext for claiming that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> is seeking to intervene in the government of West Berlin. He thought that
            under the present circumstances the population of West Germany and of Berlin considers
            his visit necessary.</p>
                    <p>2. The Chancellor said that in his government's view the East German move is a step in
            a long-prepared plan that is aimed at a gradual weakening of the status of Berlin and at
            the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. The Soviets do not wish a real Berlin crisis
            and actual travel to Berlin will probably not immediately be affected. The dangerous
            thing however, is that the East Germans have created an instrument which can be used at
            any time in the future to interfere with access.</p>
                    <p>3. The Chancellor referred to the Quadripartite document <gloss target="#t_BQD1">BQD</gloss>-CC–28 and said that the assessment contained therein of the seriousness
            of the introduction of a visa requirement was correct. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> believes that the East German measures are aimed not only at the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> but also at the Three Powers. He felt that “not just
            protests but countermeasures are needed,” if possible as contemplated in the <gloss target="#t_BQD1">BQD</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>4. What makes the present East German moves more serious, Kies-inger stated, is that
            they mark a clear escalation. There is no doubt that <pb n="681" xml:id="pg_681" facs="0711"/>the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> stands behind the East German
            regime. It is trying more and more to isolate the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
            and divide it from its allies. The Sovs are seeking “permanent right of intervention in
            the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>,” they will not accept the very sincere <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> policy of seeking a relaxation of tension. Instead, they
            intend “to force us to our knees” and they naturally seek to use Berlin for this purpose
            as the most exposed point. The Sov approach to the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
            is so blunt as to be actually disarming as when, for example, they insist publicly that
            the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> must sign the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> and that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> signature is the only
            one of interest to them.</p>
                    <p>5. The time has come to make the Sovs realize, Kiesinger said, that they cannot through
            an indefinite continuation of salami tactics force the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> to accept Sov positions. “My request,” the Chancellor said,”is that the
            Allies, as foreseen in the <gloss target="#t_BQD1">BQD</gloss>, take a very clear
            position against the East German moves.” This is necessary to maintain the confidence of
            the German population in Germany's allies. The German people will expect a very clear
            position both from the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and the Three Powers “in the
            framework of the overall political situation.” The Chancellor realized how difficult
            problems connected with Berlin were and how necessary it is to proceed with caution and
            realism. A balance is required in finding the right response but the basic elements of
              <gloss target="#t_BQD1">BQD</gloss>-CC–28 are right.</p>
                    <p>6. The Chancellor said that this was a preliminary presentation of the German views
            which would be followed by written papers spelling out the German position in greater
            detail. He urged that in the meantime the three governments issue as quickly as possible
            the proposed Tripartite statement. The German Government had not yet issued a formal
            statement and would do so only after consultation with the Allies. The statements made
            by the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> press spokesman yesterday and today were
            “impromptu.”</p>
                    <p>7. The three Ambassadors expressed, on a personal basis, general agreement with the
            Chancellor's assessment and indicated that their governments would wish to work in close
            consultation, as the Chancellor had suggested, in finding the right response to the East
            German move. The French Ambassador said that he personally was of the opinion that the
            passport and visa requirement could not be left unanswered. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> said that the United States considered the East
            German move a matter of the highest importance. He had been particularly interested in
            the Chancellor's mention of counter measures and asked if the German Government had any
            specific ideas. The Chancellor replied that they have not yet considered what measures
            can appropriately be taken by the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and the
            Allies.</p>
                    <p>8. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> also noted that <gloss target="#t_BQD1">BQD</gloss>-CC–28 foresees the possibility of the three Foreign
            Ministers and the German Government making appropriate démarches to Soviet Ambassadors
            or in the German case to East German trade reps. The Chancellor said that he would
            welcome <pb n="682" xml:id="pg_682" facs="0712"/>an initiative by the three FonMins with
            the respective Soviet Ambassadors in order to express serious concern over developments.
            The Chancellor was not yet sure that he would call in Soviet Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName> right now since he considered it in the first
            instance better for the three Allies to approach the Sovs given the fact that it was a
            Four-Power agreement which has been violated. At an appropriate time he would, of
            course, make the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>'s views known to <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName>.</p>

                    <p>The Secretary said he wished to raise the question of Berlin. We were very much
            disappointed at recent developments affecting the 4-power agreements on Berlin to which
            the Soviet Union was a party. We were always sensitive to developments affecting access
            to Berlin. It was difficult to understand why these actions had been taken without any
            consultations with the other interested parties. The measures taken affected travel and
            trade and were a threat to the viability of Berlin. He hoped the authorities in East
            Germany and in the Soviet Union realized the gravity <pb n="683" xml:id="pg_683" facs="0713"/>of making decisions affecting access to Berlin. The measures already
            taken were slowing down the traffic to Berlin. There was a further aspect and this was
            how these measures could be taken if there was a serious interest on the part of the
            Soviet Union to get Germany to sign the non-proliferation treaty. The German point of
            view was that they were already committed to their allies on the question of atomic
            weapons. They considered the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> a unilateral concession
            to the Soviets without any reciprocity. The measures with regard to access to Berlin fed
            the opponents of the non-proliferation treaty in West Germany and added an additional
            new burden on this problem. The timing almost made it look as if the purpose was to
            sabotage the non-proliferation treaty. The Secretary said we could not accept the reason
            given for these measures. The Mayor of Berlin had made it clear that the emergency
            legislation would not apply to Berlin and there had been a gradual improvement of
            relations between the United States and the Soviet Union and between the countries of
            East and West Europe. The question arose whether East Germany wanted to interrupt this.
            He concluded by saying this was indeed a very serious matter.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KVV2">Kuznetsov</persName> said the Government of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> had taken no new steps with regard to the existing
            situation on access. The line was the same as before. The East Germans were handling the
            access with respect to West Germany on the same basis as they would citizens of a
            foreign country. They now only require visas, which was a normal practice of sovereign
            countries, and allied access was not affected. It was not the intention of the Soviet
            Union to aggravate relations with the United States or with other war-time allies. We
            have developed an approach and understanding with respect to the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> which the Soviets considered a sovereign state. Any attempt on the part
            of the West Germans to connect the non-proliferation treaty with the visa problem was
            deliberate on the part of opponents of the non-proliferation treaty.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that, looking at the long-standing practice with respect to access
            to Berlin, it was hard to see how these measures could be taken in this way at this
            time. The East Germans were requiring visas and imposing a fee for transit to West
            Berlin which was a burden on access. The proposed taxes on goods in transit were costs
            which could be discussed in the existing machinery for Inter-Zonal trade between East
            and West Germany. The way in which these measures were carried out, including neglect of
            consultation among the four powers with responsibility, was of very serious concern.</p>

                    <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_LG3">Von Lilienfeld</persName> called Mr. Rostow to tell
            him that he had received a personal call from the Chancellor (off the record) on another
            matter but said that they were concerned about the German situation and in particular
            what the US and allies would do. Von Lilienfeld said that the Chancellor sounded very
            worried, that this thing might go on in Berlin, that they wouldn't be in a position to
            do much about it but protest, and that the other side could well get away with it. This
            would have a deep effect on public opinion, that there were feelings of frustration and
            discontent which seem to be in vogue, and that a weak and ineffective response could
            affect German attitudes to the allies.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rostow said that we do take the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> move very
            seriously, that it was extremely important that we work together and that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> take responsibility along with the allies.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LG3">Von Lilienfeld</persName> said that he also told the
            Chancellor this. The feeling seems to be that an <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
            move on the interzonal trade would not really be effective. Steps in other directions
            should be taken.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_LG3">Von Lilienfeld</persName> said that Diehl also called him
            about getting to Berlin by air. If PanAm and some others could increase their air travel
            to Berlin, sort of a shuttle, that this would have a great effect by showing that
            something was being done. <persName corresp="#p_LG3">Von Lilienfeld</persName> added
            that, “Now you have to wait for days before getting to Berlin.” Re the shuttle idea, he
            thought this would have a strong effect. Mr. Rostow said he would take this up with his
            colleagues.</p>

                    <p>There are continuing unconfirmed rumors that Chancellor Kiesin-ger may visit
            Washington, Paris and London in the near future to seek support. The President is
            considering sending the Chancellor a special message of support on the Day of German

                    <p>The British and French called in the Soviet Ambassadors yesterday and made strong
            representations concerning the East German measures. The Soviet representatives took the
            line that the East German measures were “routine” and did not affect Allied access.</p>
                    <p>The Berlin Task Force met for two hours this morning to consider further developments
            and to examine proposed countermeasures. The <gloss target="#t_BTF1">BTF</gloss>
            supported calling a special meeting of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
            Permanent Representatives in Brussels for June 18 or 19, when the other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries will be informed of the developments. This
            will be especially useful if their support is solicited for countermeasures in the trade
            and travel field.</p>
                    <p>In Bonn preparations are going ahead on a written tripartite legal protest, to be
            delivered in Moscow, against the violation of quadripartite agreements. We expect the
            drafts to be submitted to the three governments for approval on June 17. The Bonn
            Quadripartite Group is giving intensive study to countermeasure proposals. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> has proposed that it impose special levies on East German
            truck and barge traffic in the FRG, payable in hard convertible currencies—a suggestion
            in which we have concurred and suggested even further strengthening.</p>
                    <p>The Bonn Quadripartite Group has also agreed, with our concurrence, to propose in
              <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> that East Germans seeking to travel in the West
            (outside the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>) be required to pay fees in hard
            currencies for their travel documentation—a service which had been rendered without fee
            in the past. We are maintaining a 24-hour watch in the Operations Center of the
            Department.</p>

                    <p>13432. Subject: Quadripartite Ambassadorial luncheon discussion of Berlin access
            problems.</p>
                    <p>1. At the regular Quadripartite Ambassadorial luncheon on Berlin and related problems
            today, State Sec <persName corresp="#p_DGF3">Duckwitz</persName> made the following
            points in describing the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>'s position on the Berlin
            situation as worked out in yesterday's Cabinet meeting:</p>
                    <p>A. The formal statement to be made by the Chancellor in connection with the June 20
            Bundestag foreign affairs debate is still in preparation but will be provided to the
            Allies shortly.<note n="2" xml:id="d273fn2">For text, see <hi rend="italic">Documents on
                Germany</hi>, 1944–1985, pp. 1010–1012.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>B. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> does not contemplate an approach to Soviet
            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName> in the near future. The
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> has taken steps to inform governments around the
            world of the East German moves and of the Federal Government's assessment of them.</p>
                    <p>C. It is not opportune to take countermeasures in the interzonal trade area since this
            would be very dangerous to Berlin. <persName corresp="#p_DGF3">Duckwitz</persName> said
            the FonOff would send the three Allies a detailed explanation of this position.</p>
                    <p>D. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> is contemplating legislation which would
            bring into effect the automatic application in Berlin of Federal legislation subject
            only to negative action on the part of the Berlin Government or the Allies to prevent
            the application of individual laws. I also hope that the three Allies can provide now a
            favorable response to the FonOff aide-memoire of December 1, 1967 concerning the
            elimination of the Berlin clause in individual treaties. In this context <persName corresp="#p_DGF3">Duckwitz</persName> also mentioned that the Reichs-tag building in
            Berlin would be ready next year but his inference was not clear.</p>
                    <p>E. The Berlin assistance law would be extended without any time limit.</p>
                    <p>F. It was hoped that an air shuttle service could be established between Berlin and
            Hannover so that the total cost of travel between points in the Federal Republic and
            Berlin by air would not be greater than the train fare. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> would provide the necessary subsidies. (Further details on this available
            from other <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> sources are being reported
            separately.)</p>
                    <pb n="687" xml:id="pg_687" facs="0717"/>
                    <p>G. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> hoped to utilize the laws on political
            parties and on passports to prevent entry into the Federal Republic of undesirable
            elements from the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> whose purpose was subversion.</p>
                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_DGF3">Duckwitz</persName> estimated that the Federal outlay
            required to compensate for the effects of the new East German measures would be about
            DM115 million annually. In connection with the travel restriction paper, <persName corresp="#p_DGF3">Duckwitz</persName> said that Chancellor Kiesinger had opposed a
            public announcement on <gloss target="#t_TTD1">TTD</gloss> restrictions alone since they
            seem such a small response to the situatuion.</p>
                    <p>3. The FonOff called a Bonn Group meeting shortly after the Quadripartite luncheon
            during which the following further details and background emerged on the German
            position:</p>
                    <p>A. The report of the Harkort Task Force deals with the possibility of action on the
            part of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> to suspend the <gloss target="#t_IZT1">IZT</gloss> agreement<note n="3" xml:id="d273fn3">Interzonal trade was regulated by
              the Berlin agreements of August 16, 1960, signed by officials of the Federal Republic
              of Germany and German Democratic Republic acting as representatives of their “economic
              areas.”</note> or to begin a blanket denial of Warenbegleitscheine (shipping
            documents) thus stopping all shipments to the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. The
            Task Force concluded that such measures would be dangerous for Berlin and would not
            seriously interfere with the East German economy unless all Western countries suspended
            shipments. The Task Force concluded that this was not a likely possibility. This led to
            the conclusion that countermeasures in the <gloss target="#t_IZT1">IZT</gloss> field
            were not opportune. It was decided, however, that the Cabinet should suspend
            consideration of measures to facilitate the East German regime such as the oil subsidy,
            the settlement of the PTT account and any further increase in the swing credit. Van Well
            said that if the Allies had other suggestions to make the German side would be glad to
            hear them and it was agreed that an experts meeting would be held tomorrow.</p>
                    <p>B. The decision on <gloss target="#t_IZT1">IZT</gloss> does not cover other possible
            countermeasures in related fields such as transportation. The Ministry of Transportation
            has completed a paper on truck and barge charges which will now be considered at the
            State Sec level.</p>
                    <p>C. In considering the whole problem, the Cabinet came to the conclusion that the Allies
            had publicly emphasized their own rights frequently during the past months but that it
            would be useful if measures were undertaken by the Allies which would reinforce the
            Federal Government's position in West Berlin. This would reassure the Berlin population
            and would be an appropriate answer to the Soviet Union and to the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> had thought of
            the Berlin clause change and the applicability of Federal legislation in Berlin as long
            pending issues on which action would now be useful and appropriate. Van Well could not
            elucidate State Sec <persName corresp="#p_DGF3">Duckwitz</persName>'s reference to the
            Reichstag building. However, the <pb n="688" xml:id="pg_688" facs="0718"/>FonOff has now
            informed us that <persName corresp="#p_DGF3">Duckwitz</persName> was referring to this
            as a major <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> construction project which would soon be
            completed as an example of Federal aid. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> has
            plans to reconstruct a library as a further such project.</p>
                    <p>4. During the meeting the German side raised for discussion the German paper on the
            activities of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> trade and travel offices in Western
            countries. The French and British representatives said they had referred the German
            draft to capitals but expect that it would take several days for London and Paris to
            provide comment. Both reps thought it would probably be better if this <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> paper was not the next presentation to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. For psychological reasons it would be better to
            present <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> with some further paper outlining German
            action in either the trade or transport fields.</p>

            personally by Brandt to the FonMins in Reykjavik on Sunday.<note n="2" xml:id="d274fn2">See <ref target="#d278">Document 278</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_RHH1">Ruete</persName> first reported on the origins of the
            meeting and some of the atmospherics. Brandt was invited in his capacity as <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> Chairman. <pb n="689" xml:id="pg_689" facs="0719"/>
                        <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> emphasized this point, at one time
            making a disparaging remark about <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName> and
            saying that it is much better to have “man to man” talk between members of Central
            Committees: like Brandt and himself. Another peculiarity of the meeting, <persName corresp="#p_RHH1">Ruete</persName> said, is the fact that as late as 8 p.m. yesterday
            the East German news service, ADN, was saying that Brandt was still in West Berlin, even
            though he had been in East Berlin since 4 p.m. The implication was that the Soviets and
            the East Germans were not on the same wave length.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_RHH1">Ruete</persName> said that the origin of the meeting was
            a Soviet invitation to Brandt three weeks ago, before the East German measures on June
            10. Immediately after receiving the invitation, Brandt had cleared the idea of accepting
            with the Chancellor. <persName corresp="#p_RHH1">Ruete</persName> said that Brandt had
            done this because he was aware that the meeting was a potential “coalition splitter” and
            he wanted to be very sure that he and the Chancellor had a full understanding from the
            outset. Then came the East German measures on June 11, before Brandt had a chance
            actually to visit <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName>. Brandt again got the
            Chancellor's approval for the meeting, taking fully into account the new situation
            created June 11. (Comment: <persName corresp="#p_RHH1">Ruete</persName>'s account was
            not clear on whether the immediate initiative for holding the meeting yesterday came
            from Brandt or <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName>, and questioning by the
            DCMs failed to clear up this point. The obscurity suggested that the immediate
            initiative came from Brandt.)</p>
                    <p>4. In reporting on the meeting itself, <persName corresp="#p_RHH1">Ruete</persName>
            read carefully from Brandt's written report. Brandt introduced the subject of Berlin. He
            referred to the East German visa measures as a “grotesque” thing to apply to Germans on
            German soil. He also said the East German measures were contrary to the whole effort at
            détente, both politically and psychologically. Brandt cited Chancellor Kiesinger's March
            1st answer to <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName>
                        <note n="3" xml:id="d274fn3">For text, see <hi rend="italic">Documents on Germany</hi>,
              1944–1985, pp. 988–989.</note> as proof that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
            wants no aggravating of the situation in Berlin.</p>
                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> answered with what Brandt
            characterized as three defensive arguments: A) The East German measures had nothing to
            do with existing international agreements, and the East Germans were entirely in their
            rights in doing what they did; B) The volume of traffic has not in anyway been affected.
            To prove this <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> pulled out voluminous
            statistics on traffic for individual days before and after June 10; C) In general, the
            Soviet Union wants no tension in and around Berlin.</p>
                    <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> further said that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> has no political claim to West Berlin. <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> said that the Soviet Union has never put into
            question the right of West Berlin to work culturally and economically with the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>.</p>
                    <pb n="690" xml:id="pg_690" facs="0720"/>
                    <p>7. Later in the evening, the subject of Berlin came up again, this time raised by
              <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName>. He raised it in a curious way,
            asking Brandt what he should report to Brezhnev as Brandt's main point on Berlin. Brandt
            replied that he should tell Brezhnev that he, Brandt, had stressed the damage which
            would result for all concerned, including the détente effort, from the East German
            access measures. <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> then said that the
            real problem was the efforts of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> to politicize
            West Berlin. He cited the holding of the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> Parteitag
            and the plenary session of the Bundestag in West Berlin as examples. Interestingly,
              <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> disparaged the importance of the
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> emergency legislation, strongly implying that this
            had simply been used as a pretext by the East Germans.</p>
                    <p>8. Brandt again referred to the Chancellor's March 1 message to the Soviets to show
            that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> has no claims on Berlin and wants no
            tension there. Brandt then repeated that the East German measures were serious and spoke
            particularly about the burden which they place on the average man. They hit hardest
            those least able to bear the burden economically. Brandt at this point suggested that it
            might be possible to work out a kind of “lump sum” overall settlement, negotiated
            directly between the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and the East German government,
            for all the costs of the use of the Autobahn. This presumably would substitute for the
            individual charges for visas and the movement of goods. (Comment: Questioning of Ruete
            by the DCMs made it seem that this proposal had not been thought out within the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and may have been a spur of the moment idea by
            Brandt.)</p>
                    <p>9. Significantly, <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> reacted quite
            positively to this idea. Brandt felt that this was an encouraging sign.</p>
                    <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_RHH1">Ruete</persName> said that Brandt's general impression
            of the whole conversation was that it was neither discouraging nor encouraging, but he
            did feel that <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> was trying to make clear
            that the Soviets wanted no worsening of the situation in Berlin. There was also, by
            indirection, some flavor of the Soviets not being entirely with the East Germans on the
            June 11 measures, but this was nothing you could put your finger on.</p>
                    <p>11. In a press conference earlier this afternoon Brandt carefully dodged questions
            about the substance of his talks with <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName>.
            He stated merely that they had discussed questions of mutual interest, including, of
            course, the situation in Berlin.</p>

                    <p>The Under Secretary welcomed Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BA13">Boeker</persName>
            and told him how useful it was to have an opportunity to get German thinking on the
            Berlin problem just before the Reykjavik meeting.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BA13">Boeker</persName> said that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> felt very strongly that the situation should not be dramatized, and is
            trying to avoid creating the impression of being overly concerned. But everyone in the
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> knows of the great potential for danger in the
            present situation, and the Government is greatly concerned over the long-range effects
            of what the “<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>” has now done.</p>
                    <p>Three facts stand out:</p>
                    <p>1. The “<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>”; is trying to enhance its prestige and
            standing as an international entity.</p>
                    <p>2. The new “<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>” visa and passport measures impose an
            economic burden and irritating hindrances on traffic with Berlin, but in themselves they
            do not represent a serious danger.</p>
                    <p>3. The great danger is that if the “<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>” gets away with
            this, it will be tempted to escalate the fees and other hindrances to the point where
            they become prohibitive and highly dangerous.</p>
                    <p>As things now stand, it will cost the German people about 100 million <gloss target="#t_DM1">DM</gloss> per year. One can easily imagine how the “<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>” can screw this figure upward.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> had tried to look at the situation through the
            eyes of Pankow and Moscow. It did not seem to be a case of Ulbricht dragging the <pb n="692" xml:id="pg_692" facs="0722"/>reluctant Russians along, but rather a long-range
            concerted plan. Two factors seem to have induced the Russians to let the “<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>” act at this time: various signs of weakness in the
            Western camp, and unrest, such as in Czechoslovakia, in the Eastern camp.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> does not wish to dramatize and escalate the
            situation, but neither does it wish to behave like an ostrich. What the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> has to think about together with the three Allies and
            with the wider <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> group is, at what point do we
            really have to undertake serious countermeasures. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> especially wants to talk with its American friends about what can be said
            to the Soviets to convince them that a point will unavoidably be reached, as things are
            now going, when the situation will have become not merely irritating but
            intolerable.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary asked whether the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> has any
            further concrete steps in mind.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BA13">Boeker</persName> replied that there were none that the
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> hadn't already mentioned to the three Allies in
            Bonn for discussion in Reykjavik. He said that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
            is open to suggestions for things that might be done together to prevent further “<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>” escalation.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName> pointed out that the major action
            available to us short of coordinated action in the trade field has now been taken with
            the imminent <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> approval of <gloss target="#t_TTD1">TTD</gloss> measures.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> asked whether the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> saw the purpose of countermeasures as overcoming the
            existing situation or the prevention of further “<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>”
            escalation. <persName corresp="#p_BA13">Boeker</persName> replied that it would be good
            if we could overcome the existing situation, but this would be difficult. He repeated
            the suggestion he had made earlier today of trying to reach a compromise with the
            Soviets for the “<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>” to enforce its demand for visas
            for entry into East Germany but drop the visa requirement for transit to Berlin.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BA13">Boeker</persName> said that it was useful to compare the
            situation now with that at the time of the Berlin Wall. The construction of the Wall was
            a dramatic act but was essentially defensive—to stop the economic hemorrhaging of East
            Germany. The current move is not dramatic but it is a dangerous and aggressive act
            because it is aimed against Berlin's viability. We should all, in responding to Soviet
            statements that the matter doesn't involve the Allies, reply publicly that it does
            indeed involve the Allies because if the “<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>'s” act
            remains unchallenged, the potential will have been created for the destruction of
            Berlin's viability.</p>
                    <p>Under Secretary Rostow pointed out that we have protested to the Soviets and are
            looking hard with our German, British and French colleagues at the problem. He said that
            we are not clear, however, on the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> position. Is the
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> interested in trying to get the “<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>” action undone? Has thought been given to asking the
            German people to avoid getting passports for travel to Berlin?</p>
                    <pb n="693" xml:id="pg_693" facs="0723"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BA13">Boeker</persName> said “no”, because that would really
            strangle Berlin. The enormous traffic between the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
            and Berlin would come to a halt except for a trickle of persons by air. The fact of the
            matter is that there is a power physically in existence which demands passports and
            visas. In order to keep Berlin alive and keep the traffic flowing, the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> can only go ahead and acknowledge the existence of this
            power and announce, as Kiesinger did today, that the exercise of that power to force
            stamps on <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> citizens does not mean recognition of the
              “<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>”.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary said that he understood the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
            view that it could live with the “<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>” effort to try to
            gain prestige from visa enforcement, and could put up with the inconvenience of the
              “<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>” travel and freight hindrances. It was somewhat
            more difficult to see how the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> could handle the
            psychological problems. How will the Berliners react? How do you choose the point at
            which you draw a clear-cut line beyond which the situation cannot be accepted?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BA13">Boeker</persName> replied that the Berliners have over the
            years shown a great deal of stamina and determination, and they will continue to do so
            up to a point. Where that point is, nobody knows. It depends on the firmness of the
            responses and on the continued Allied presence in Berlin.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary asked what the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> would have us
            do.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BA13">Boeker</persName> replied that the Allies in Reykjavik should
            make clear how high the stakes in Berlin are, and should show solidarity with the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. In this connection, <persName corresp="#p_BA13">Boeker</persName> said, it was hoped that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> might visit Germany after the Reykjavik meeting. He anticipated that
            Brandt would officially invite the Secretary when they met in Reykjavik.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BA13">Boeker</persName> said that it was important that the Foreign
            Ministers at the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting should state clearly and
            publicly that the situation in Berlin is close to that danger point of
            intolerability.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName> pointed out that we had discussed this
            morning the interzonal trade as a possible countermeasure. It is regarded traditionally
            as internal German trade, and the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> is approaching
              <gloss target="#t_IZT1">IZT</gloss> countermeasures very cautiously because of this;
            because it is not easy to reverse; and because evidently the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> had considered this as an isolated German measure rather than a
            coordinated Western move. But we had thought of trade measures in terms of a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>-wide step which could be quite effective. There are
            some loopholes in “<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>” trade with the West, e.g.
            Austria and Sweden. But with common <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> action, trade
            measures could hurt the “<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>” considerably. If it were
            decided by the Governments involved that some form of trade measures were needed, he was
            not pessimistic about the chances of getting common <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> action.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary said that he agreed that if some such step were to be taken it
            would be better to do enough to make it really pinch the East Germans.</p>
                    <pb n="694" xml:id="pg_694" facs="0724"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BA13">Boeker</persName> thought that selective trade measures might
            be useful. He added that <gloss target="#t_IZT1">IZT</gloss> is intimately bound up with
            supplies going to Berlin—Berlin might be badly hurt if <gloss target="#t_IZT1">IZT</gloss> were cut off.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BA13">Boeker</persName> said that there is an isolated danger that
            people in Germany will acquire a feeling of being left isolated, in the absence of
            counter- measures. Also, in both the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss>, there is a growing feeling that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> will have to take another look at the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> in the light of the “<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>”
            and Soviet actions. Perhaps there would be some virtue to tying <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> signature on the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> to a Russian
            guarantee on Berlin access.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary said that we should look at possible selective measures on a
            contingency basis, to see that we are in agreement on what would work and what
            wouldn't.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BA13">Boeker</persName> said that another aspect of “<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>” trade that could be examined would be the transit of
              “<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>” goods through Western countries on the way to
            ports—Austria, Denmark, Italy and others provide such transit facilities.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName> asked where further contingency
            planning is taking place.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PA7">Puhan</persName> replied that this work is focused in
            Bonn, with the Quadripartite Group there.</p>
                    <p>Under Secretary Rostow said that it is clear that Ulbricht wants to isolate the two
            parts of Germany and the two parts of Europe from each other. We in the West, on the
            other hand, want more and more contact to take place. Our public position is clear that
            we regard the recent “<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>” steps as illegal, and we have
            protested against them. We don't want to take measures that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> doesn't want to do itself or doesn't want us to do. Evidently, the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> is searching for a plan that would avoid future
            escalation rather than addressing itself to the current “<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>” steps. Is there an advantage to waiting? <persName corresp="#p_BA13">Boeker</persName> replied that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> is doubtful
            that serious countermeasures can be mounted, and it doubts whether there are available
            countermeasures that really would be effective. What has to be done is to make clear to
            the Soviets that there are limits to Western tolerance.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary said that the Soviets, the Germans, and we are all in the dark as
            to just what that limit is.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Sonnenfeldt thought that the Soviets rather than Ulbricht control the Eastern side
            of this problem. It is necessary to get the Soviets to put the brakes on Ulbricht by
            showing the Russians that their own interests would be better served that way.</p>
                    <p>Under Secretary Rostow said that trade countermeasures could be costly and might
            interrupt the processes of trying to bring the two parts of Germany closer together. He
            wondered whether it would be easier to face this early, when a matter of principle is
            involved, or later when it becomes <pb n="695" xml:id="pg_695" facs="0725"/>a matter of
            the amount of money the “<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>” is trying to extort from
            its hold on access.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BA13">Boeker</persName> replied that there is not much in the way
            of countermeasures which offer much promise of effectiveness. It is necessary to say
            something to the Russians to show them that their own interests are involved.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PA7">Puhan</persName> said that in considering the use of
            countermeasures it is necessary to weigh their possible effect on public opinion. What
            will the effect of the situation be on the next elections in Germany, on the political
            parties, on the German public's view of the Allies. The U.S. looks to the Federal
            Republic for answers to some of these questions.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary thought that a significant public gesture should be made by the
            Foreign Ministers in Reykjavik.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BA13">Boeker</persName> agreed. He thought that at Reykjavik it
            would be necessary to convince the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Allies that it
            is not merely a question of visas that is involved but the potential strangulation of
            Berlin. Mr. Sonnenfeldt said that we would all have to think about some ways to get the
            Soviets and the “<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>” to stop the process of escalation
            against Berlin, and even pull back somewhat on implementation of the new “<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>” regulations.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary said that in considering countermeasures we should not give undue
            weight to the economic difficulties that would be involved for Western countries.
            Psychologically it might impress the Russians more to see a willingness on the part of
            the West to undertake measures that hurt us somewhat.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PA7">Puhan</persName> said that it was important to point out
            to our German friends the falseness of various news stories that the U.S. is unwilling
            to support the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> in this problem because of our desire
            to improve relations with the Soviet Union. We have, in fact, supported the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and Berlin. The President's message is an example. Mr.
            Sonnenfeldt thought that we should be thinking of steps to be taken now to avoid a
            greater crisis three months from now.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary proposed that we all take a look at specifics on possible
            countermeasures that the Secretary and Brandt could look at in Reykjavik. We should also
            do some work on deciding on what kind of statements should be made there.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PA7">Puhan</persName> pointed out that we already have the
            draft text of a Tripartite legal protest to be delivered in Moscow.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BA13">Boeker</persName> said that in the recent talks with the
            Soviets on Berlin, the U.S. and U.K. referred to the breach of international agreements,
            whereas the French had only referred to a violation of established practices. He
            wondered whether the French are going along with the draft text of the Tripartite legal
            protest.</p>
                    <pb n="696" xml:id="pg_696" facs="0726"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JAC1">Johnpoll</persName> replied that the French Embassy in
            Bonn had gone along with it, but it had of course been referred to Paris for government
            decision, which we do not yet have.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BA13">Boeker</persName> agreed that we should all come up with a
            few specifics for examination in Reykjavik and that it would have to be made clear there
            to the other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Allies that steps should be taken in
            order to avoid a later, more serious, difficulty over Berlin.</p>

                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Summary</hi>. Chancellor Kiesinger during an hour's conversation
            with the Ambassador this afternoon emphasized in strong terms the seriousness with which
            the entire <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_CSU1">CSU</gloss>, the
            over-whelming majority of the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> and the Federal
            Government as a whole view the East German passport and visa requirement. He thought
            that if this step were not met firmly it would be followed by a more serious Communist
            escalation. The objective must be to bring the East Germans to revoke the requirement
            whether this would prove possible in the end or not. The Federal Government was prepared
            to take any steps within its power and while the Chancellor did not feel that <gloss target="#t_IZT1">IZT</gloss> constituted a very effective measure, he did not entirely
            rule it out. The United States for its part must talk directly to the Russians in a
            “most energetic” fashion. The German people must get the feeling that the Americans are
            “firm.” The United States must convince the Soviets of the seriousness with which we
            view the situation. The Chancellor expressed his great hope that the Secretary would
            visit Bonn after the Reykjavik meeting if his health permits. Such a visit alone would
            have a beneficial psychological effect for the West Germans and Berliners. <hi rend="italic">End summary</hi>.</p>
                    <p>1. The Ambassador met for an hour's discussion of the Berlin situation with Chancellor
            Kiesinger this afternoon at the latter's request. The <pb n="697" xml:id="pg_697" facs="0727"/>Chancellor at the beginning noted that he had just come from a meeting of
            the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> Steering Committee where yesterday's Bundestag
            debate had been discussed. He wished to express his views on the Berlin situation to the
            Ambassador before leaving Bonn for the weekend.</p>
                    <p>2. The Chancellor said that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>'s friends must know
            that we here—all of the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>, and overwhelming majority
            of the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> and the whole government—view the Berlin
            situation as “very serious.” The Chancellor was particularly pleased that the President
            in his message had expressed regret that Berlin “was again threatened.” The East German
            move is in reality a threat, the most serious since the Wall. This may, the Chancellor
            noted, seem overly dramatic to an outsider but not to those who are familiar with the
            past history. Access, including civilian access, has always been most closely linked
            with the continued freedom of West Berlin.</p>
                    <p>3. The Chancellor said that the passport and visa requirement has undoubtedly been
            under consideration in East Berlin for a decade. It is interesting that the East Germans
            chose this particular moment to implement it. They may have felt that the present
            combination of circumstances—the Presidential elections in the US, the political
            upheaval in France, and the economic problem in England was particularly opportune.
            Developments in Czechoslovakia may also have played a part. The Chancellor could not
            judge whether the initiative was taken by the Soviets or the East Germans. The important
            thing was that the decision was made to take this “dangerous step.” “It is my strong
            conviction,” the Chancellor said (switching into English), “that at present the German
            people feel what will happen next, and then and then?”</p>
                    <p>4. The Federal Government desired to avoid escalation. It was in any event too weak
            alone to take strong steps. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> is prepared however,
            to take any measures it can in East Berlin. The Chancellor knew that the three Allies
            had frequently mentioned <gloss target="#t_IZT1">IZT</gloss>. He was ready to do
            something in this field but he feared that it is not an effective measure as it had been
            in 1960. The <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> was no longer as vulnerable as then.
            The Chancellor emphasized that his government was ready to do everything “to strengthen
            the viability of Berlin.” As he had said in the Bundestag, something must be done to
            make the other side cancel the new requirement. “We must not put up with it. We must
            strongly demand that the requirement be rescinded.” Otherwise they will certainly
            escalate and the next step would mean that the confidence of the German people in
            Germany's partners, particularly the US, would be dangerously weakened. For this reason
            energetic and vigorous steps are required. The Chancellor noted in this connection that
            the extreme groups on the left and on the right in Germany are both endeavoring to
            exploit anything they can to encourage anti-Americanism.</p>
                    <pb n="698" xml:id="pg_698" facs="0728"/>
                    <p>5. The Chancellor then said that he had asked Brandt to urge the Secretary to come to
            Bonn after the Reykjavik meeting if possible. (At this point a news ticker was brought
            to the Chancellor indicating that the Secretary had announced he would decide on a visit
            to Bonn next Monday.) The Chancellor noted that the Secretary knows the whole Berlin
            problem so well and has always taken such a firm stand. The fact alone of the
            Secretary's visit would be of psychological benefit in West Germany and Berlin.</p>
                    <p>6. The Chancellor said that the great majority of the German people are convinced that
            the US and the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> must stand together. His own party in
            particular has fought bitter fights for German-American friendship against earlier calls
            in Germany for neutralism. He doesn't expect the impossible from the Allies but he hoped
            that most of all in Washington the situation was seen as seriously as in the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>7. The Ambassador replied that the United States Government certainly considered the
            new developments affecting Berlin most serious. Washington was not inclined to say that
            the German side must take countermeasures before we would do anything. In the
            Ambassador's view the key principle was to act “together.” He noted that some effective
            steps had already been decided upon and that the Bonn Group has proven a useful
            instrument. The Ambassador thought that the German proposal for an air shuttle service
            between Berlin and Hannover and perhaps other cities was a very good idea. Whether the
            East Germans will revoke the visa requirement, however would, in his view, depend on
            whether the Soviets are really backing them up. Effective countermeasures taken now
            might in any event deter further Communist encroachments. The Chancellor agreed that
            this was an important objective.</p>
                    <p>8. The Ambassador then asked the Chancellor just what he had in mind that the United
            States should do. He replied that the most important thing is for the US to talk
            directly to the Soviets. He was asking for a “most energetic US approach.” He had talked
            with the President and knew our problems—that we must carefully manage crises and not
            destroy such possibilities for understanding with the Sovs as may exist. We should not
            think that the Germans were the “last warriors” of the cold war. The German people,
            however, must get the feeling that the Americans are firm. If together we can reach a
            common “design” for action and the US warns the Soviets at the same time, this will
            help.</p>
                    <p>9. The Chancellor noted that he had made clear to Sov Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName> that the Federal Government is prepared to be
            realistic about Federal activities in the city. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>'s legal position must be preserved and he could not say that a political
            party or the Bundestag would never again meet in Berlin. On the other hand, small
            questions such as the Defense Committee or police trade union meetings were of no real
            interest, <pb n="699" xml:id="pg_699" facs="0729"/>and de facto solutions could be
            found. The Chancellor had the impression, however, that the Sovs were no longer
            interested in such solutions.</p>
                    <p>10. The Ambassador, referring to the Chancellor's request for a firm American approach
            to the Soviets said that for us to be firm there must be something concrete “in sharp
            focus” to be firm about. The Chancellor agreed that any US démarche must be credible.
            The Federal Republic, he said, is an orderly and healthy country. There were
            difficulties with the farmers and there would be further student unrest but there would
            be no political upheaval in the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> unless some new
            source of unrest is introduced. He did not wish a loss of confidence in Germany's Allies
            to constitute such an element.</p>
                    <p>11. The Ambassador, after expressing his admiration for the way in which the Federal
            Government had so far handled the East German threat stated that he would report the

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> told the Secretary he was
            leaving tomorrow for consultation in Moscow but did not know for what subject. He rather
              <pb n="700" xml:id="pg_700" facs="0730"/>doubted it was for a Central Committee
            Meeting, and in any event expected to be back within a few days. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then said he had been instructed to make the
            following comments in regard to the Berlin situation in response to the Secretary's
            observations to <persName corresp="#p_KVV2">Kuznetsov</persName> last week in New
              York.<note n="2" xml:id="d277fn2">See <ref target="#d270">Document 270</ref>.</note>
            He said he was to tell the Secretary that the Soviet Union, as was hoped was the case in
            the U.S., was not interested in creating a state of tension in regard to the Berlin
            situation. The actions by the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> were the result of an
            unrealistic and provocative policy followed by the West Germans. These actions however
            did not affect the rights for travel of the U.S., France or Great Britain, and were not
            inconsistent with any foreign power agreements. The <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
            had for some time exerted rights in regard to passports, visas and documentation at
            certain specific points in their territories and that there would seem to be no grounds
            for any allied concern.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary inquired what particular policy of the West German Government did the
            Soviet Government have in mind. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said it
            was using West Berlin as a meeting place for Bundestag committees and treating it as
            though it belonged to West Germany. There was also the emergency measures for the West
            Germans. The Secretary pointed out that the emergency measures specifically did not
            apply to West Berlin. He then pointed out the 1949 agreements in which the Four Powers
            reverted to the situation which existed prior to the blockade, namely on free transit of
            persons and goods.<note n="3" xml:id="d277fn3">For text, see <hi rend="italic">Documents
                on Germany</hi>, 1944–1985, p. 221.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Then ensued a discussion as to whether or not the East German actions were in violation
            of the 1949 agreement, with the Ambassador maintaining that they were not since nothing
            new was added, but the Secretary and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCE2">Bohlen</persName>
            maintained that the power to regulate could theoretically imply the power to limit or
            stop. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> did not agree with this
            interpretation. The Secretary pointed out in support of his argument that as he
            understood it a family of five West Germans would have to pay $17.50 to go into East
            Berlin, and he also pointed out that the taxes imposed on goods could theoretically be
            increased so as to constitute a real impediment to their movement.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary then inquired exactly what was it that Ulbricht feared. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he did not know that Ulbricht was afraid,
            to which the Secretary replied that he obviously was; he seemed to be concerned at the
            establishment of a peaceful, normal situation around Berlin, and it was not clear what
            he was afraid of—was it the situation in Czechoslovakia or was it simply that he was
            afraid of peaceful coexistence?<note n="4" xml:id="d277fn4">In telegram 13964 from Bonn,

                    </list>
                    <p>The Secretary said that Berlin had been much on our minds. He was very much interested
            in how the Foreign Minister saw the Berlin problem. He would welcome information
            regarding Brandt's visit with Abrasimov. The Secretary said he had three talks with
            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> and, as Brandt knew, one with
            the Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_KVV2">Kuznetsov</persName> on
            Berlin.</p>
                    <p>Brandt said he was anxious to give the Secretary full details on his meeting over and
            above those already given by <persName corresp="#p_RHH1">Ruete</persName> to the three
            DCMs in Bonn,<note n="2" xml:id="d278fn2">See <ref target="#d274">Document
              274</ref>.</note> and those which had been given to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> yesterday.<note n="3" xml:id="d278fn3">No record of
              this conversation was found.</note> However, his notes would not arrive until later
            and details would have to wait until then. He said Abrasimov had asked him to come and
            see him before the East Germans imposed their restrictions.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked whether Brandt thought <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> knew of East German intentions when he invited the Foreign
            Minister of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Brandt was not sure. <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> told him that he
            had been ordered to go to Moscow to report to the meeting of the Supreme Soviet later
            this month and to the meeting of the Central Committee in early July. <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> had told Brandt he had instructions to discuss
            all aspects of the <pb n="702" xml:id="pg_702" facs="0732"/>
                        <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>-Soviet relationship and to report to Brezhnev,
              <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>, and Podgorny with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> present. <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> invited Brandt to say something first.</p>
                    <p>Brandt said he told <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> that he sometimes
            felt a mood of resignation regarding the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Two
            topics were then discussed in detail: the renunciation of force and Berlin. Brandt said
            Brezhnev had called while he was talking to <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> asked what
            points he should make to Brezhnev. Brandt said that he told him to say to Brezhnev that
            on Berlin the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> must not go contrary to the spirit
            of détente. He told him to say that if the Soviets were not satisfied with the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>'s April 9 memorandum on renunciation of force,<note n="4" xml:id="d278fn4">For text, see <hi rend="italic">Documents on Germany</hi>, 1944–1985,
              pp. 997–1002.</note> Bonn was prepared to have further discussions. <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> told Brandt that an answer to the April
            memorandum was on its way. Brandt gave it as his view that the Soviet reply would be
            quite negative.</p>
                    <p>Brandt concluded that there were no modifications in Soviet policy. While the Soviet
            presentation was not aggressive, there was stubborn insistence on their point of view.
            The Secretary said we had had that experience for many years.</p>
                    <p>Brandt said the Soviets appeared to play with history at times. He had recalled to
              <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> that there were times in history
            where the Russians and Germans had been able to live in harmony. Brandt had cited in
            this connection the end of the 18th Century. <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> did not disagree.</p>
                    <p>Brandt said <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> had a paper with him on
            Berlin. Reading from this paper, <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName>
            attacked Brandt, stating that when he went from Berlin to Bonn and became Foreign
            Minister, the claims of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> on Berlin were stepped
            up. <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> said he did not understand why the
            West Germans were complaining about the recent East German measures. He told Brandt that
            the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> was fully aware of the treaty the Soviet Union
            had with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and that it was the view of the Soviet
            Union that it was within <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> competence to impose the
            measures it had recently enacted. Brandt told <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> that it was incongruous that the Yugoslavs and the West Germans
            should agree to dropping visas at the very moment the East Germans were imposing
            them.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary recalled that one Soviet official had called the East German measure
            anachronistic. Brandt said <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> recited
            figures of people traveling to West Berlin, demonstrating that more West Germans went to
            West Berlin after the imposition of the East German measures than before. He asked
            Brandt how that could be called damage. Brandt said <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> told him something which was apparently not in his paper, saying
            the Soviets wanted quiet (Ruhe), but warned Brandt that any manifestation of increased
            FRG presence in Berlin like the <pb n="703" xml:id="pg_703" facs="0733"/>planned <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> Party Convention or a meeting of the Bundestag would have
            very serious consequences. Brandt added that <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> said relations would be somewhat easier and certain things could
            be settled more easily after Schuetz, the Mayor of Berlin, was no longer President of
            the Bundestag. The Secretary noted that this was a point that bothered the Russians.</p>
                    <p>Brandt continued by saying that in Berlin itself, there was no feeling like that in
            1958 or at the time of the Wall, but there was a good deal of resignation. Brandt said
            he was much worried about a deterioration. He felt that we might be in danger of getting
            on very wide roads, leading nowhere if we continue to talk about and plan on the basis
            of countermeasures developed in the past. The East Germans had been given the green
            light by the Soviets because of the effect their action would have on Czechoslovakia and
            on strengthening Bloc solidarity. East Berlin took its recent action despite knowing
            that in a relatively short period of time it could have gotten a good deal of money out
            of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. He referred in this connection to the
            willingness of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> to pay oil subsidies and certain
            road fees. He said Finance Minister <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> had
            been agreeable. He concluded that East German officials dealing with trade matters had
            been pushed aside in favor of a political act. If this conclusion was correct, fees for
              <gloss target="#t_TTD1">TTD</gloss>'s, fees to be paid by East German ships, are all
            of questionable value as countermeasures.</p>
                    <p>Brandt assured the Secretary that he was aware of American criticism that the West
            Germans had reacted reluctantly to the East German measures. He said he was aware of our
            expectations that the Germans should do something more. But, Brandt said, if his theory
            was correct that the East German measures represented a political action, it would have
            to be dealt with by the three allies with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and,
            unfortunately, the United States would have to bear the largest part of this burden.
            Brandt said very emphatically that the Russians must not get the impression that there
            can be détente which excludes the problem of Berlin. He did not wish to leave the
            Secretary with the impression that the Germans were rigid on the point of other
            countermeasures. But in his view the political significance of the East German action
            was the dominant factor.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that he had hit the Soviets very hard on the Berlin situation. He
            referred again to his meeting with <persName corresp="#p_KVV2">Kuznetsov</persName> and
            his three talks with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>. The
            Secretary said he had some real concern about the total relations of Communism and the
            Free World. He saw a real problem in the Soviet-China relationship. He thought the
            developments in Czechoslovakia and Romania had disturbed the Soviets greatly. He
            recalled the feeling close to panic in Moscow after the Middle East crisis erupted. He
            thought the Soviet leaders faced real problems which made them very dangerous.</p>
                    <pb n="704" xml:id="pg_704" facs="0734"/>
                    <p>The Secretary said that he personally had been expecting difficulties in Berlin, in
            Korea, and in the Middle East. He had asked <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> what Ulbricht was afraid of. What dangers would Ulbricht see in
            the Czechoslovakia developments. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> had
            been unwilling to reply.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that we were in a very delicate total situation. He felt we would be
            very fortunate if we got through this fall without difficulties in Korea.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary agreed with the Foreign Minister that developments in Czechoslovakia had
            a bearing on the situation. So did the situation in France and the unsettled political
            situation in Italy. He felt that the surprises and tragedy in the U.S. electoral
            campaign had also affected Soviet thinking. At no time had solidarity among the Western
            powers been of greater importance.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said the Soviets had emphasized in talking to us their strong feeling
            about <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> efforts to incorporate West Berlin. The
            Secretary characterized the East German move as shrewd, since the Soviets were aware of
            differences between the constitutional view on Berlin held by the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and the three Western powers. The Secretary said the
            Soviets cited the recent German emergency legislation as a cause of East German
            retaliation. He said he had brushed this aside, and he was aware that Berlin Mayor
            Schuetz had denied the applicability of this legislation to West Berlin. The Soviets
            have told us, the Secretary continued, they had no desire for tension and did not wish
            to affect access to Berlin. They called the recent measures simply a change in form, a
            change in formalities. The Secretary said the Soviets knew that U.S. citizens traveling
            to unrecognized regimes like that of Communist China or of Cuba regularly get visas. The
            Soviets went to special pains to say they wanted quiet (Ruhe) in Berlin. The Secretary
            assured Brandt he didn't accept this Soviet explanation. He felt the Soviets must have
            known that the East German move would cause real problems. He told Brandt that we had
            protested the violation of Quadripartite Agreements reached after the end of the
            blockade of Berlin.</p>
                    <p>At this point, the Secretary expressed his appreciation for Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BA13">Boeker</persName>'s coming to the United States. He said he was
            looking forward to seeing Chancellor Kiesinger in Bonn.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary reminded Brandt that the <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName>
            administration had begun with a Berlin crisis. At that time we had taken a very strong
            lead. We increased our defense budget by millions. We moved troops but no one else added
            anything. The Secretary said we were all alone. The French made no contribution and
            indeed even the Foreign Minister's predecessors in the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> directed their suspicions at us rather than at the Soviets. The British
            were a pale echo. He said he wanted to be sure that we acted now with complete
            solidarity. He stressed the importance of establishing Four Power unity in the meeting
            tonight.</p>
                    <pb n="705" xml:id="pg_705" facs="0735"/>
                    <p>The Secretary said we were prepared to press the Soviets hard. He felt that it would be
            impossible for us to accept physical limitations on access to Berlin. This would affect
            Allied rights to Berlin. He reminded Brandt that the power to tax, as Chief Justice
            Marshall once said, was the power to destroy.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary agreed that countermeasures presented an extremely frustrating problem as
            long as physical access was not impaired. He mentioned the restrictions on <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> travel already taken by <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. He wondered if it was not possible that the financial arrangements
            affecting trade could not be a matter of discussion between the two Germanies. He asked
            whether there had been any real interference with access.</p>
                    <p>Brandt said there were very few cases of interference. He recalled the East German
            decree on travel through the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> by <gloss target="#t_NPD1">NPD</gloss> members and a later one relating to <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> officials. He felt that the East Germans were not
            enforcing the latter measure.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary interjected that the measure against <gloss target="#t_NPD1">NPD</gloss>
            members was obviously very clever because the Soviets knew we wouldn't fight a war over
              <gloss target="#t_NPD1">NPD</gloss> members going to Berlin.</p>
                    <p>Brandt said he had sought <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>'s judgment last
            week on the Soviets' intentions in Czechoslovakia. <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> said he was almost sure the Soviets could not turn the clock back in
            Czechoslovakia. He gave as reasons the Soviets' serious problems in other parts of the
            world, and the fact that Czechoslovakia had greater support in Eastern Europe,
            particularly in Hungary and Rumania, than the Soviets realized.</p>
                    <p>Brandt mentioned a recent incident where the East Germans stopped a truck carrying
            atlases which depicted the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> as East Germany. This
              <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> gesture was a possible indication of future
            incidents. Brandt said the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> could claim underwear
            manufactured in Berlin was produced for the West German Army. He thought that a most
            successful countermeasure would be to invite journalists to go to Berlin in an Allied
            car with Allied travel orders.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName> queried as to what the East Germans
            would do. There was no answer.</p>
                    <p>Brandt pointed out that in his view the imposition of fees was more important than the
            use of visas. Fees could be doubled; they could be used in a number of arbitrary ways.
            Brandt said he had told <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> that the West
            Germans had been willing to make practical arrangements for the use of services
            maintained by the East Germans, roads, waterways, etc. He thought it was better to make
            a lump sum payment to the East Germans for the use of such services than to have fees
            levied on individual users. He noted that something like this had been worked out within
              <gloss target="#t_IZT1">IZT</gloss> when he was Mayor in Berlin. He thought such
            proposals were of interest to East German planners, if they had any say in the matter,
              <pb n="706" xml:id="pg_706" facs="0736"/>since they would remove the uncertainty
            regarding receipts of West German payments.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary thought Brandt's efforts had been very constructive. He asked whether the
            time had come to suggest to the Soviets a Joint Commission to regulate such matters. It
            appeared to him, and he emphasized he was speaking only in an exploratory sense, that
            there were advantages in making such a proposal to the Soviets, even if it were
            rejected.</p>
                    <p>Brandt seemed receptive to the suggestion. He also mentioned the possibility of going
            back to the idea of establishing an access authority for Berlin though he wondered if
            the suggestion was not now passe. He said he would appreciate it if the Allied side
            would speak to the Russians about establishing some sort of a Commission. He thought the
            Germans could parallel this action by insisting that a pre-condition for it should be a
            guarantee of freedom of travel and traffic.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary thought we might get somewhere if we related travel and traffic to Berlin
            with general international practice. He wondered what India charged Pakistan for the
            transit of goods. He wondered if general international practice in this regard might not
            be studied and applied to Berlin. He saw a whole range of possibilities. Positive steps
            also were needed to strengthen Berlin. He asked if organizations now located elsewhere
            could be moved to Berlin.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName> said we had already suggested that the
            International Bank and the Fund hold their next meeting in Berlin.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary wondered whether we could find ways of buying more in Berlin. He thought
            the quadripartite Bonn Group might look into this. The Secretary said that if the East
            Germans intend to depress the economy of Berlin, we must demonstrate that we can lift
            it.</p>
                    <p>Brandt said he would appreciate the inclusion in any record of support for Berlin the
            fact that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> was willing to make its contribution.
            Brandt noted recent efforts by the Bundestag to give preferential economic and financial
            treatment to Berlin. He then noted that in a recent Cabinet discussion the question had
            been raised whether, after seven years, the time had not come to restate or reformulate
            Allied commitments to Berlin. He said his colleagues in the Foreign Office, and the
            Chancellor, also would not be unwilling to help reformulate the relations of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> to Berlin. Brandt said he would tell the French and
            British about it tonight if it made sense to the United States. Brandt said that
            differences in interpretation of the legal situation in Berlin had been exploited by the
            Russians. They might, however, be prepared to accept an interim arrangement until Berlin
            becomes a whole. He said this might be put in terms of West Berlin being “linked to the
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>” rather than described as a “Land of the Federal
            Republic.”</p>
                    <pb n="707" xml:id="pg_707" facs="0737"/>
                    <p>The Secretary said that this is a problem because it causes difficulties with the
            Russians and is divisive among the Four.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName> said the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> “link” to Berlin might be stated in terms of viability.</p>
                    <p>According to Brandt, <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> had voiced no
            objection to Berlin's cultural and economic relations with the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. He wondered if experts might not be able to devise a formula which could
            take advantage of this Soviet view to make it difficult for them to impede travel.</p>
                    <pb n="708" xml:id="pg_708" facs="0738"/>
                    <p>The Secretary recalled that in the crises of 1961 and 1962 it was of the greatest
            importance in dealing with the Soviets to stress that we—the Allies—were responsible for
            Berlin; that the United States was in Berlin. Our responsibilities for Berlin and our
            position in Berlin resulted from World War II. We are not indebted to the Soviets or
            anybody else for our presence in that city. The Secretary said the Soviets had had to
            accept this, and that is why we have been sensitive to any suggestion that our
            responsibility for Berlin be diluted. The Soviets have emphasized that they have no
            interest in interfering with allied rights to Berlin. He noted that deriving from this
            is an allied interest in the closest association of Berlin and the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary noted that we could exercise little pressure on the East Germans because
            our trade with them was very small. Moreover, few Americans travelled to the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Brandt agreed and noted that German interest was far greater since 600,000 people
            travelled between West Berlin and the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> during one
            month.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName> noted that as many as 10 million West
            Germans move to and from West Berlin annually.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister said the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Agreement on TTDs
            would affect very few people. Trade between East Germany and the West had declined.
              <gloss target="#t_IZT1">IZT</gloss> trade had declined last year by 11 percent, and by
            13 percent in the first quarter of this year. At the same time Brandt noted that <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> trade with the East was on the increase.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName> pointed out that if measures in the
            trade field were to be effective, they would have to be concerted and imposed by all
            members of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Brandt said he liked the British very much but he had great doubts about British
            willingness to go along with that suggestion.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary laughingly agreed and reminded Brandt that we remembered British trade
            with Cuba and China.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName> said that he simply wanted to
            emphasize that we could not think of countermeasures in the trade field in
            isolation.</p>
                    <p>Brandt said if the existing <gloss target="#t_IZT1">IZT</gloss> agreement were
            cancelled the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> could not get another one including
            Berlin.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary recalled that during an earlier Berlin crisis the British had insisted
            trade countermeasures were steps to be taken only just before nuclear weapons would be
            used.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>After welcoming his guests to the Quadripartite Dinner, Mr. Steward asked Mr. Brandt to
            give an account of how he saw the situation in Berlin. Mr. Brandt said that if time
            permitted, he would also like to discuss German views on European security and the
            renunciation of force.</p>
                    <p>On Berlin, he thought the measures taken by the East Germans were part of a political
            program. A risk existed that the Soviets would be encouraged by their current success
            and seek to implement further measures. <pb n="709" xml:id="pg_709" facs="0739"/>He
            thought the Alliance as a whole was called upon to do something about the East German
            restrictions. He indicated three areas in which action could be taken:</p>
                    <p>1. Manifest Western solidarity, to make clear that harassments would bring the Allies
            more closely together. FonMin Brandt expressed his appreciation for the statements of
            support from his colleagues and for <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>'s efforts in
            the field of temporary travel documents (<gloss target="#t_TTD1">TTD</gloss>'s). He said
            it was important that political statements were devised to influence the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>2. Strengthen the viability of Berlin. He said the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
            Government would be promulgating a law which provided for substantial economic aid to
            Berlin. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> would also assume the burden of the
            levies imposed on passengers and traffic to Berlin. He felt that, in connection with
            Berlin's viability, we must make it clear how important we regard the ties between the
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and Berlin. He assured his colleagues that they
            need fear no juridical arguments, but he wished to emphasize that the ties between the
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and Berlin were of vital importance. He asked for
            a clear reply by the Allies to the Soviets in support of <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> efforts. He suggested it might be useful if the legal advisers in the
            Bonn Group were to study how the Western sectors of Berlin could be “linked to” the
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> in the absence of reunification.</p>
                    <p>3. Demonstrate to East Berlin that measures like their recent ones do not pay. He said
            countermeasures had to hit them where their greatest concern lies, namely in their
            desire for recognition.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Brandt said the East Germans knew that they were giving up certain economic
            advantages when they took their most recent actions. The Western Germans had been
            prepared to grant them a petroleum subsidy, and to make payments for postal services
            rendered by the East Germans. They discounted these economic advantages and opted for
            political actions. Thus, Minister Brandt felt countermeasures in the economic sphere
            would not be very effective. He urged his colleagues not to fall victim to the view that
            the Germans were running away from using <gloss target="#t_IZT1">IZT</gloss> to counter
            the East German measures. He noted <gloss target="#t_IZT1">IZT</gloss> trade had
            decreased greatly in 1967, by more than 11%. There was another decline of 13% in the
            first 3 months of this year. The <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> was trading more
            with other Western countries as well as with the East of Europe. He asked what measures
            could be taken. He said it was important that the Three Powers in the Allied Travel
            Office make absolutely clear when they refuse <gloss target="#t_TTD1">TTD</gloss>'s to
            East Germans that their action is in response to East German travel restrictions which
            directly affect the Allies responsibility. He asked if the Three could look into the
            possibility of transporting some Germans who were refused admittance by the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> by Allied Military transport to and from Berlin. In other
            words, Minister Brandt said, we <pb n="710" xml:id="pg_710" facs="0740"/>would like to
            move not only into the air but by land. He recalled the use of travel orders issued by
            the Allies to Germans when he was in Berlin.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Brandt asked what would happen if countermeasures failed. Mr. Brandt said Berlin
            was an essential problem which could not be excluded from East-West discussions. He
            added that there could be no détente which excluded Berlin. Minister Brandt said
            Kiesinger felt that we all must insist upon a withdrawal of the East German measures.
            Mr. Brandt made a distinction between travel into the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> itself and transit travel from the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> to
            Berlin. He pointed up the additional burdens which the East German measures imposed on
            the little man in Germany. He said a family with 3 or 4 children, going on vacation from
            Berlin to the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, would have to add another 50 <gloss target="#t_DM1">DM</gloss>'s to their costs. He said this was not a theoretical but a
            very real problem.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Brandt recalled his conversation with Soviet Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName>. He said <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> had
            insisted that he was seeing Brandt as a member of the Central Committee of the Communist
            Party of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Ambassador's Counselor in picking up the German
            Foreign Minister in West Berlin for the meeting had demonstratively addressed him as
            “Mr. Party Chairman”. Mr. Brandt said he had made it very clear to <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> that the Germans regarded the situation created
            by East Berlin as very serious and that it could have very serious consequences for
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>-Sov relations. Mr. Brandt said <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> rejected these arguments. He regarded the East
            German action as normal and said it represented only a change in formalities. He cited
            figures to Brandt to show that travel to Berlin had increased since the East German
            measures had been put into effect. He assured Brandt that the Soviets wanted no trouble.
            He accused Bonn of creating all the noise. He warned Minister Brandt against any
            manifestation of <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> activity in Berlin, mentioning in
            this connection a planned <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> Party Convention and a
            meeting of the Bundestag, which Minister Brandt said incidentally had not been planned.
              <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName>, according to Mr. Brandt, told the
            Foreign Minister that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>'s claims to Berlin had
            increased since Brandt had come to Bonn.</p>
                    <p>Minister Brandt said on other subjects he could discover no change in the Soviet
            position with the possible exception of some Soviet interest in trading with West
            Germany, particularly in the field of natural gas.</p>
                    <p>Minister Brandt said <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> claimed the
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> aide-memoire of April 9 regarding the renunciation
            of force had been entirely negative, but in later discussions said he would not exclude
            following up on it. He indicated that Brandt's presentation of the case might influence
            the Soviet reply.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Brandt said the Soviets don't like the Grand Coalition in Bonn, in which respect
            they did not differ from some of his people. Brandt said he asked <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> if he thought that any future German government
              <pb n="711" xml:id="pg_711" facs="0741"/>would be more likely to bring about better
            relations between Germany and the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said we were very much concerned about the East German measures, both
            when looking towards the past and looking towards the future. Looking towards the past,
            they were a violation of Quadripartite Agreements. Looking towards the future, he said
            one could ask “What next?”. He reminded his colleagues that Chief Justice Marshall had
            said the power to tax is the power to destroy.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary told of his talks with the Soviets.<note n="2" xml:id="d279fn2">See <ref target="#d270">Document 270</ref> and <ref target="#d277">277</ref>.</note> They
            took essentially the same line with him that <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> had taken with Brandt. They expressed their intention not to
            increase tensions in Berlin, and said they did not mean to interrupt access to Berlin
            nor to interfere with the rights of the Allies. The Soviets said the East German
            restrictions were formalities. The Secretary continued that he did not get the
            impression the Soviets were contemplating or would contemplate the elimination of these
            measures. He gave it as his estimate that the East German action had been carefully
            considered in advance and was not the result of weekend deliberations. He felt the
            Soviets would be rather stubborn.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said his impression was that these moves were rather clever. The Soviets
            and East Germans could say that what was being done was in accord with normal
            international practice. The Soviets were emphasizing those aspects where differences
            between the Allies and the FRG exist on the status of Berlin. They judge these measures
            will not seem worth a crisis to the Allies. The fact that people and goods continue to
            move makes it difficult to work up a great deal of excitement. Thus, the Secretary
            concluded, the situation was not very satisfactory.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary suggested that we should examine the steps we can take to make it clear
            to East Berlin that action like that taken by the East Germans does not pay, but more
            specifically to make it absolutely clear that real interference with access is
            unacceptable.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary agreed with Brandt that the countermeasures thus far suggested were not
            too promising. He thought that conceivably it was one of Ulbricht's objectives to reduce
            contact between Berlin and the Federal Republic. It may be that Ulbricht was frightened
            of developments in Czechoslovakia. The Secretary thought these measures may be another
            kind of wall to prevent further contacts. He said the countermeasures which could be
            taken by the U.S. alone were not meaningful. There was little travel or trade between
            the United States and the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. Perhaps 50 East Germans
            came to the United States in the course of a year. He stated U.S. preparedness to
            examine with our allies what measures could be taken which would not hurt West
            Berlin.</p>
                    <pb n="712" xml:id="pg_712" facs="0742"/>
                    <p>The Secretary suggested further that we ought to examine new possibilities of
            reinforcing the viability of the City of Berlin. He thought the East German measures
            gave a special urgency to this task, to reassure West Berlin in a very tangible way. He
            thought the Bonn Group might wish to concentrate on this aspect. In this connection, the
            Secretary paid his respect to the attitude of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
            toward the viability of Berlin.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary suggested that the two administrations of the two Germanies might somehow
            deal with the problem of German access to Berlin. The arrangement proposed by Mr. Brandt
            earlier for a lump sum payment for services rendered by the East Germans might make it
            possible to link the question of access with other matters of interest to the East
            Germans. We would like to make them realize that consultation and agreement are
            necessary.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary speculated regrading Soviet approval of the East German action. He
            thought the timing was both curious and ominous. He referred to Minister Brandt's
            statement that the East Germans had discounted in advance the advantages of arrangements
            with the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> which would have been profitable to them.
            He said surely the Soviets must have known that the East German restrictions would make
            signing of the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> by the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> more difficult. The Secretary thought the explanation may be found in
            Eastern European developments. He felt that Ulbricht's concern with Czech developments
            had motivated the move. The Secretary denied that passage of the emergency legislation
            by the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> had anything to do with the Berlin situation.
            The Secretary concluded by saying that we take the situation very seriously and we want
            to make absolutely clear that we will not allow Berlin to suffer.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador Seydoux began his remarks by recounting the conversation between Alphand and
            Soviet Ambassador to France Zorin a few days ago. Zorin's reply, according to Seydoux,
            was not unlike that of Soviet officials elsewhere. Seydoux said his Government was much
            interested in Kiesinger's and Brandt's statements in the Bundestag on June 20.<note n="3" xml:id="d279fn3">For text of Kiesinger's statement, see <hi rend="italic">Documents on Germany, 1944–1985</hi>, pp. 1010–1012. For text of the Brandt
              statement, see Meissner, <hi rend="italic">Die deutsche Ostpolitik</hi>, pp.
              264–267.</note> He expressed his admiration for the way in which the German Government
            was dealing with the problem. He referred to the questions raised and measures indicated
            by his German colleague, i.e., “linking Berlin to the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>,” the transport of German civilians in military cars, etc. He stated that
            the French were, of course, ready to study these problems. He felt the best place for
            studying them was in Bonn but he cautioned that all would have to make sure that
            measures undertaken would not create graver problems than they solved.</p>
                    <p>Seydoux said he was also very much interested in the Secretary's remarks. He associated
            himself with the view that the situation was very <pb n="713" xml:id="pg_713" facs="0743"/>serious and repeated French readiness to examine all proposals but again,
            he cautioned, the measures must not create more problems than they solved.</p>
                    <p>British Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SM12">Stewart</persName> agreed with the
            assessment that the situation was very serious. He complained that there was no
            justification for these measures and that they were taken without consultation after the
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> had made determined efforts to improve relations
            with Eastern Europe. Perhaps it was this effort on the part of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> that caused the restrictions to be imposed. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM12">Stewart</persName> felt the U.S.S.R. was losing support in Eastern
            Europe. He suggested that some may be hoping the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
            would slacken off its policy of détente which would suit the Soviets very much.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Secretary said he found <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> very
            hard and unyielding during his last visit to Moscow.<note n="4" xml:id="d279fn4">
                            <persName corresp="#p_SM12">Stewart</persName> visited Moscow May 22–23.</note> He said
            that if the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> slackened its policy of détente, Moscow
            could say it never had been real.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Secretary thought that with regard to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>'s reference to the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>, the Soviets
            could always turn <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> hesitation to sign into propaganda
            against the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. He was certain the Soviets wished to
            maintain the thesis that Germany was always to be feared. It was his view that the
            Soviets would like to provoke the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> into a reversal of
            its current policies.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM12">Stewart</persName> said that all had agreed on
            countermeasures which were right, proportional and supportable. They should drive home
            the need of the Soviets to take seriously these measures.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM12">Stewart</persName> found Minister Brandt's suggestion of
            closer links between Berlin and the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> entirely
            suitable. He recommended that the proposal of the German Foreign Minister to have German
            civilians carried by military automobiles to Berlin ought to be considered. He felt
            further the Bonn Group should also study measures to help with the viability of Berlin.
            He thought we could not rule out further measures because of the seriousness of the
            situation. Like his French colleague, he cautioned prudence.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Secretary said the problem was to move with great care in order not to
            inflame the situation without however losing all in the end. The Foreign Secretary
            concluded by saying to Mr. Brandt that he wanted a manifestation of Western solidarity.
            He believed that the German Minister wanted a statement out of this meeting.</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister Brandt said he would like to make an addendum. He noted that it was
            not very difficult for a citizen of West Germany to sign a paper when travelling to
            Berlin, stating that he was a citizen of West Germany. He thought it was more
            destructive however for a Berliner <pb n="714" xml:id="pg_714" facs="0744"/>to have to
            state that he was a citizen of a “separate political entity”. He had no doubt that this
            in the long run would affect the morale of the people in Berlin.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary agreed that the use of the term “separate political entity of West
            Berlin” was contrary to Allied concepts and could cause problems. He felt this matter
            could best be examined by the Quadripartite Bonn Group.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Brandt made a reference to the Secretary's remarks regarding the recent German
            emergency legislation. He said the Soviets had overestimated the opposition to these
            laws on the part of West German labor leaders. The opposite effect had been achieved,
            even among students. He called this a serious miscalculation.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Brandt said he also wished to note that the Eastern European countries had reacted
            negatively to the East German measures, citing Czech and Yugoslav newspapers and press
            associations to prove his point. He noted further that Italian Communist papers will
            weigh in against the East German measures. He said Ulbricht had stopped tourist traffic
            to Czechoslovakia and has forbidden the sale of a Czech Communist German-language weekly
            paper in East Germany. As a result, the Czechs would make it a daily even though there
            were not too many Germans in Czechoslovakia.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Brandt turned to <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> eastern policy. He said both
            Chancellor Kiesinger and he would not allow themselves to be provoked by Ulbricht into a
            position not their own. He said <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> foreign policy had
            received very strong support from the Bundestag.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Brandt noted that the German Government had some problems with morale, both in
            Berlin and the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> itself. He asked his colleagues to
            avoid using the word “protest” since people had concluded that this was an empty
            gesture. He thought a further possibility to give Moscow some additional food for
            thought existed if the third world would support the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. He felt the third world would understand that the East German actions were
            contrary to the spirit of détente.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Brandt thanked his colleagues for their remarks regarding the viability of the City
            of Berlin. He thought any additional help that could be given in this regard would be
            most welcome. He assured his colleagues that when he spoke of linking the City of Berlin
            to the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, he did not intend to raise old legal
            controversies. He said he wished to state once more that if his colleagues believed
            there was any sense in going back to the idea of establishing an international authority
            on access to Berlin—a proposition for the two administrations to control traffic to
            Berlin under an allied umbrella—he would be willing to go along. However, he remained
            skeptical.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, the German Foreign Minister asked that a statement, which would emerge
            from this Quadripartite Meeting should be added <pb n="715" xml:id="pg_715" facs="0745"/>as an appendix to the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> communiqué with a
            paragraph early in the main communiqué referring to the appendix. He felt under no
            circumstances should a reference to Berlin by the Fifteen become point 12 or 13 of the
            communiqué. He said such slighting of the serious situation which had been created would
            disappoint the German public. He also asked for language less legal but more
              political.<note n="5" xml:id="d279fn5">For text of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> communiqué, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>,
              July 15, 1968, pp. 75–77.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>There followed a brief discussion regarding the line to be taken with the press after
            this meeting. It was generally agreed that the Four would point out that they had
            discussed solidarity of the Allies, the seriousness with which all of them regarded the
            situation and further measures to deal with it. The Secretary thought we should say that
            there had been a complete review of the situation. Full agreement had been reached that
            the East German measures were serious and contrary to international agreements and long
            standing practice. He suggested further that we would say that we would be discussing
            these matters with the other allies after which we will make our plans known.</p>
                    <p>The meeting adjourned at this point after designating four advisers to work on a draft
            of a statement.</p>
                    <p rend="center">DINNER</p>
                    <p>At the start of the Dinner following the Quadripartite Meeting, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM12">Stewart</persName> asked Mr. Brandt to say a few words about the
            European Security Conference problem which Brandt had mentioned earlier in his
            presentation.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Brandt said whenever the subject of a European Security Conference arises the
            question is how to deal with East Germany. He said the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> proposal is to create a kind of link so that when the time comes a new
            relationship would have been reached between the two parts of Germany.</p>
                    <p>Continuing, he said, however, that the security conference idea is blocked. He said he
            saw this on his recent trip to Yugoslavia and noted that not even all of the Group of
            Ten felt as strongly as the Dutch, the Belgians, and the Danes on the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> side.</p>
                    <p>He noted that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> had said in Aide-Memoires to the
              <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>

            non-use of force declarations. As far as East Germany is concerned he sees some formulas
            which would not recognize the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> as a state but which

                    <p>He said that we must make clear to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> that not
            regarding the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> as a sovereign state does not mean

            and that the validity would run from the declarations themselves and not from the manner

                    <p>He recalled that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> had said in 1954<note n="7" xml:id="d279fn7">For text, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>,

                    <p>The Secretary welcomed this idea and noted that the US finds itself in a situation
            where it is often necessary to reach agreement with regimes that we do not recognize,
            citing Hanoi and Peking.</p>

                    <p>Mr. President:</p>
                    <p>Walther Casper called me Saturday P.M., June 23, 1968, from Germany. He asked me to
            pass to you the following personal message from Chancellor Kiesinger, with whom he had
            just talked at length.</p>
                    <p>1. The Chancellor was “most grateful” for your message on Berlin.<note n="2" xml:id="d280fn2">See <ref target="#d272fn2">footnote 2, Document 272</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>2. The Chancellor was “not in the slightest worried” about basic U.S. support for
            Berlin. Unlike the situation in the past, there is “no nervousness” between the German
            Chancellor and the American President. There will be no requests for “new
            guarantees.”</p>
                    <p>3. In the light of some reports that U.S. circles regard the Bonn reaction to East
            German measures as “lukewarm,” he wishes you to know:</p>
                    <p>—The German government takes the measures against Berlin “most seriously.”</p>
                    <p>—The “moderate” German reaction and the avoidance of “spectacular” moves is the result
            of a considered policy arrived at in the light of <pb n="717" xml:id="pg_717" facs="0747"/>“the world situation.” Kiesinger does not want Germany to do things which
            would interfere with East-West détente, Vietnam negotiations, or any other constructive
            possibilities.</p>
                    <p>—Kiesinger does not feel he is acting from domestic political weakness. The German
            people and the citizens of West Berlin are “purposeful and steady.” They would support
            stronger measures. The recent student trouble in Berlin should not be taken as a measure
            of any basic weakening of fiber there.</p>
                    <p>4. Although the pressure on Berlin was instigated by <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>, it was clearly permitted and supported by Moscow. Moscow, as
            well as <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>, will be watching closely what
            Germany, the U.S., and Germany's other allies do—or fail to do. If our reaction and mood
            are weak, there will be further “turns of the screw” which could either change the
            status of Berlin or the status of the Eastern zone of Germany. Therefore, we must all
            stand up firmly at the beginning of the campaign of pressure. We must head this off
            before they decide “salami tactics” could yield them major results.</p>
                    <p>5. The Chancellor is pleased with steps taken by <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
            and hopeful that the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting will increase the
            sense of solidarity on this issue—sending a helpful signal to Moscow and <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>.</p>
                    <p>6.<note n="3" xml:id="d280fn3">President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>
              bracketed paragraph 6 of the memorandum and annotated: “OK if State agreed.” A second
              notation reads: “7/1/68 Mr. Rostow notified <persName>John Walsh</persName>.”</note>
            In addition—because of U.S. influence in Moscow—he hopes we will instruct our Embassies
            around the world that:</p>
                    <p>—The U.S. takes the pressure on Berlin most seriously.</p>
                    <p>—We shall resist further pressures.</p>
                    <p>—We are watching the situation closely.</p>
                    <p>—This attitude should “ooze out” into diplomatic circles so that word gets back to
            Moscow.</p>
                    <p>7. Our strategy should be to convince Moscow that it has more to lose than to gain by
            letting <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> go further down the road of
            pressure on access to Berlin.</p>
                    <p>8. With respect to the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>, Kiesinger does not wish to
            raise an explicit threat that Germany will not sign in the face of these pressures on
            Berlin. But he does think it wise for us to state what is the political fact in Germany;
            namely, the pressure on Berlin is creating an “atmosphere” in which the acceptance of
            the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> will be “more difficult.”</p>

                    <p>13837. For the Secretary. Subject: Report of conversation between Kiesinger and
              <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> at Bonn. Also present: Brandt and <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>.</p>
                    <p>1. Kiesinger began by extending the Secretary a hearty welcome. He was grateful that,
            although the Secretary had not been well and had to make a long trip from Iceland, he
            had nonetheless come. His visit had great value because it showed the German people they
            could count on American friendship.</p>
                    <p>2. The Secretary said he was glad to come because he wanted to bring back to President
              <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> Kiesinger's thinking.</p>
                    <p>3. Kiesinger expressed his gratitude to President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> for the message which he had sent concerning Berlin and said he
            wanted to thank the President once again. He did not want to repeat himself, but there
            was one thing he wanted to say very clearly which was that there was no desire unduly to
            dramatize the Berlin situation and there was at present no sign that a crisis would
            arise. But a crisis could occur soon if we did not join together to resist such
            measures. We are in a very evil situation in which their side tries to achieve their
            purposes by piecemeal processes which they could not expect to achieve all at once.</p>
                    <p>4. The gravest danger is that there would be a crisis of trust and confidence in the
            German Govt and in Germany's Allies. People therefore ask what will be the next step? If
            there is a next step, will there be only verbal protests?</p>
                    <p>5. There is a two-fold anti-Americanism in Germany: (A) On the extreme left are the
            students and the anti-Vietnam group. They are unimportant. It is not at all comparable
            to French student unrest. But they do poison the situation in Berlin and their continued
            unrest has changed the face of Berlin. (B) The other anti-Americanism is right-wing
            neo-Nazi. They were able to obtain almost 10 percent of the vote in Baden-Wuerttemberg.
            It is a small minority containing farmers, small business people, and foolish
            nationalists. Certain circumstances could make them dangerous too.</p>
                    <p>6. There is unrest everywhere in the world and the Allies must stand together. The
            Chancellor said he knew that the Secretary as an experienced statesman is under no
            illusions about Communism. We Germans, on our side, favor détente, but Moscow does not
            like the turn of <pb n="719" xml:id="pg_719" facs="0749"/>events whereby Germany is no
            longer attacked as she used to be in Romania, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Yugoslavia
            and Hungary. This govt must try everything to give people faith in the strength of the
            West. This should not be hard to do. People here are contented. With some exceptions,
            there is a high living standard. I can give you my word that what happened in France
            could not happen here. While everything can be improved and sincere complaints must be
            taken seriously, we have, by and large, 60 million stable people ready to carry their
            share of the load. It is therefore better to meet this crisis and the sooner we do it
            the more people will side with the US—whether in or out of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>7. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said that he could understand
            the anti-Americanism caused by the Vietnam war and other problems. But the other side of
            the coin was the growth of isolationism in America which, he said, his successor will
            have as his no. 1 problem. He will also have to face a big debate on a sharp reduction
            of forces in Europe.</p>
                    <p>8. He said he was not surprised that there was pressure on Berlin. He had expected it.
            When you consider what the Soviet Union was doing in the Middle East and what is
            happening to Vietnam, Laos and South Korea; when you know that the Soviet attitude is
            getting more and more ideological with more of cold war flavor and with increased
            opposition to bridge-building; when you take note of Soviet problems with Peking and
            Czechoslovakia, you must then recognize that it all adds up to a Soviet desire to put
            pressure on Berlin.</p>
                    <p>9. The harassment of access routes in Berlin is a very serious matter. If it should be
            accelerated it would become more so. Our primary effort must be with the Soviet Union as
            we have no leverage on East Germany. It is not easy to change the Soviet Union. The new
            group is different from <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>. The Secretary
            said we would follow up hard and that the Four Western Powers must have solidarity. If
            the Four can be united then there could be progress.</p>
                    <p>10. They must also help the economic livelihood of Berlin itself. We would, of course,
            be instantly involved in any physical violence there. It looked like a hard summer. The
            Soviet Union might be a little frightened (to which Kiesinger commented in the
            affirmative). The sight of Romania walking out of the Warsaw Pact, the events in
            Czechoslovakia and East Germany—these things must cause concern, but with full
            consultation and a common point of view, our side could be confident.</p>
                    <p>11. Kiesinger agreed that <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> showed his
            hand more than the present group and wondered whether the present group was actually
            stronger or whether they felt uncertain.</p>
                    <p>12. The Secretary referred to the inertia of committee operations. It is hard to take a
            forward step. Once it is taken, it is hard to take a backward one.</p>
                    <pb n="720" xml:id="pg_720" facs="0750"/>
                    <p>13. Kiesinger said he would meet <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> in
            September and saw merit in taking up Berlin with him before that time. Kiesinger quoted
              <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> as saying “We are more for German
            reunification than any other government. Reunification is vital to the interests of
            France.” Kiesinger said he had heard that the French attitude at Reykjavik had not been
            “too good.” He recalled that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> had said
            that the United States was the real danger and not the Soviet Union. Whiskey was more
            dangerous than vodka. The Soviet threat was only “military,” whereas the U.S., by its
            very nature, was constrained to dominate. Kiesinger said he thought <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> did not intend to leave <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>14. The Secretary said that solidarity among the Four was very important if we were to
            impress the Russians. In the 1961–62 crisis when we said “If you do this, it means war,”
              <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> had stood aside. The Secretary
            suggested that Kiesinger might find in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
              communiqué<note n="2" xml:id="d281fn2">For text, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, July 15, 1968, pp. 75–77.</note> a basis for sending
              <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> a message.</p>
                    <p>15. Kiesinger said that is a good idea, perhaps we can do it.</p>
                    <p>16. The Secretary said it would impress the Russians.</p>
                    <p>17. Brandt said it should be done soon.</p>
                    <p>18. Kiesinger asked whether the Secretary was expecting trouble in Korea.</p>
                    <p>19. The Secretary said we were watching Korea. There had been some increased
            infiltration by North Korea, but he saw no large infiltration by Korea. The U.S. had
            been very plain with Russia. It would not tolerate the invasion of South Korea. The next
            time it would not be a long war with 130,000 casualties, but a very violent short war.
            There is unrest all through Southeast Asia.</p>
                    <p>20. The Secretary said that in Paris even when the talks are behind the scenes,
            everything is known to the press. Private talks will come but not yet.</p>
                    <p>21. Kiesinger said the stronger you admonish the Russians, the more success we will
            have. Perhaps they won't take back the measures they have already taken but our warning
            would prevent them from going ahead.</p>
                    <p>22. East Germany, he said, wants international recognition as a sovereign state. They
            must be made to feel they have had a setback.</p>
                    <p>23. The Secretary said that governments look at the problem of sovereignty differently
            from the way in which public opinion looks at it. After all, we are talking to Hanoi and
            Peking and do not recognize either.</p>
                    <p>24. Kiesinger said he liked the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> communiqué as
            regards non-recognition.</p>

                        </item>
                        <item>Mr. Nitze </item>
                        <item>Mr. Warnke </item>
                    </list>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName> welcomed the German guests and said
            we would be happy to discuss any subject that they wished to raise. Initially, however,
            he expressed an interest in Dr. Schroeder's views on Czechoslovakia.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Schroeder said that he would be glad to comment on the <gloss target="#t_CSSR1">CSSR</gloss> and then would like to hear Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName>'s views on the situation in Vietnam. He noted that he had first
            been briefed on the Southeast Asia problems on a visit to the United States in 1953 and
            that he regretted that it still remains an American burden 15 years later.</p>
                    <p>In discussing Czechoslovakia, Dr. Schroeder said that he wanted to avoid any impression
            that his position is influenced by ethnic considerations, such as the Sudeten matter.
            The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> has no thought of intervention and believes that
            the situation is one within the Soviet Bloc, the members of which must be left to work
            out their own solutions. He finds the letter from the Central Committees of five Warsaw
            Pact nations<note n="2" xml:id="d282fn2">For text of the July 15 letter, see Robin
              Remington (ed.), <hi rend="italic">Winter in Prague</hi> (Cambridge, MA, MIT Press,
              1969), pp. 225–231.</note> particularly interesting. This letter maintains that the
            adoption of Socialism by a nation constitutes an “irreversible decision.” He commented
            further that the world has now lived through 50 years of Communism, and no one, of
            course, can tell what will happen during the next 50 years. What is certain, however, is
            that there will be changes both in the Communist world and in our own. The immediate
            question is whether the new developments in Czechoslovakia can survive. This question is
            affected by the fact that this is not 1956, but 1968. Overt intervention by the Soviet
              <pb n="722" xml:id="pg_722" facs="0752"/>Union would have repercussions both in
            Eastern Europe and in the West. The Soviet leaders, however, are probably more afraid of
            reactions in their own country. The Russian population does not want an armed conflict.
            The Russian leaders thus find themselves in a dilemma for which there is yet no panacea.
            This dilemma is how to keep allied countries with them, but without force. The <gloss target="#t_CSSR1">CSSR</gloss> has the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>'s good
            wishes, but it must remain clear that outsiders are not responsible either for the
            present situation or for its resolution.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName> then asked what effect the ferment
            in Czechoslovakia may have on other East Europeans, such as Hungary, Rumania, Poland,
            Bulgaria and even East Germany. Dr. Schroeder replied that the Central Committees of
            four of these countries signed the letter of rebuke to the Czechoslovakian Presidium.
            Rumania had not, but it was not there when the letter was drafted. We must assume that
            the Central Committees of these other countries meant what they said. Nonetheless, they
            are apt to be influenced by a trend toward independence.</p>
                    <p>The situation with respect to the rulers in East Germany—Pankow—is somewhat different.
            The ruling groups in the other Warsaw Pact countries think of themselves as nations.
            Pankow, in contrast, is very much aware that it rules over only part of a nation. Also,
            although it does not reflect credit on his countrymen, Dr. Schroeder believes that the
            Germans are apt to stick quite rigidly with spiritual goals or ideological principles
            once they are adopted. The rulers in Pankow regard themselves as “perfect Communists.”
            Dr. Schroeder sees differences, however, between those who have lived in Russia and
            those who have not.</p>
                    <p>[Here follows a 2–1/2 page discussion of Vietnam.]</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName> then suggested that Dr. Schroeder
            indicate the specific points he would like to discuss. Dr. Schroeder listed three: (1)
            Force reductions in Europe; (2) Consultation on nuclear matters; (3) Armaments.</p>
                    <p>On the first point, he asked whether we felt from the meeting at Reykjavik that the
            Foreign Ministers had the same view on force reductions as that expressed by the Defense
            Ministers in Brussels.<note n="3" xml:id="d282fn3">For text of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Foreign Ministers declaration, see Department of
              State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, July 15, 1968, p. 77. For text of the December
              1967 declaration, see ibid., January 8, 1968, pp. 49–52.</note> He observed that the
            German view has not changed. He continues to feel that such reductions as have been made
            by <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> members have elicited no response from the
            Soviet side. Both sides are subject to pressures created by popular aspirations and the
            heavy costs of defense. But these forces can be brought to bear with more vigor in the
            West. Although they may in time have some effect in the East, there is as yet no sign
            favorable for simultaneous force reductions. Dr. Schroeder queried whether the Soviets
            might be waiting for an end to the Vietnamese war before following any <pb n="723" xml:id="pg_723" facs="0753"/>reductions in force. He asked whether we held the same
            view on force reductions as in May.</p>
                    <p>At Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName>'s request, Mr. Nitze made an
            initial response. He said that we saw no sign of reductions by the Soviets. On the
            contrary, their defense budget has increased by about 20%. He also agreed that pressures
            for cuts in the defense budget are greater in the West, because the Communist countries
            have less sensitivity. In his opinion, the meetings at Brussels and at Reykjavik
            reflected no difference in views. Views in the US Senate, on the other hand, are
            influenced by Vietnam and other considerations. Although he does not believe Congress
            will pass the <persName corresp="#p_SWS2">Symington</persName> amendment—which would
            require reduction of American forces in Europe to a total of 50,000<note n="4" xml:id="d282fn4">Reference is to the announcement by Senator <persName corresp="#p_SWS2">Stuart Symington</persName> (D-Mo.) that he would introduce an
              amendment to the 1969 Department of Defense appropriations bill cutting off funding
              for all but 50,000 of the 337,000 U.S. troops in Europe. The Senator withheld the
              amendment during the bill's mark-up.</note>—a milder alternative might find
            acceptance.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName> said that we are taking the
              <persName corresp="#p_SWS2">Symington</persName> amendment seriously and that it poses
            some danger. The United States is faced with serious domestic problems of race and
            poverty. Costly programs of education, housing and welfare will be required to solve
            these problems. Some of our people say stop the war, cut defense costs and “get our own
            house in order.” Senator <persName corresp="#p_SWS2">Symington</persName> claims that
            the five leading newspapers in his State all favor his amendment. He is concerned about
            defense costs, the balance of payments problem and the over-all US economic and monetary
            posture.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName> cited the fact this position has
            considerable public appeal. Other Senators, including Senator <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName>, support it, although they don't go as far.
            Senator <persName corresp="#p_RRB1">Russell</persName>'s position gave some cause for
            concern, but he now appears to begin to recognize Senator <persName corresp="#p_SWS2">Symington</persName>'s approach is unwise. The issue will be presented after the
            Senate Appropriations Committee completes its hearings. Senator <persName corresp="#p_SWS2">Symington</persName> plans to present his amendment when the
            Appropriations Bill is on the Floor. As a parliamentary device, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName> regards it as improper, though legal. In any
            event, it will be hard to veto, since the entire Defense appropriation is involved.</p>
                    <p>In reply to Dr. Schroeder's question on timing, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName> said that the bill could have been voted on next week if he had
            testified this week. Now, however, he has arranged with Senator <persName corresp="#p_RRB1">Russell</persName> that his appearance will be deferred until next
            week or even later. This means that the bill will not come before the Senate before it
            recesses on August 3rd. We regard a delay as desirable. The developments in Eastern
            Europe have been helpful and show that we should not rock the boat at this time. He
            continued, <pb n="724" xml:id="pg_724" facs="0754"/>however, that an American political
            axiom asserts that you “can't beat something with nothing.” In declining order of
            preference, we would like (1) to defeat the <persName corresp="#p_SWS2">Symington</persName> amendment and have it thrown out entirely; (2) if this proves
            infeasible, to present the mildest alternative—a Congressional requirement that we
            report back in six months on what might be done; (3) if this is not enough, to accept a
            requirement for a reduction in Calendar Year 1969, for a five-year reduction plan or
            some variant of these. If we had our choice, we would elect to keep the situation as it
            is now but, as he noted in his remarks to the Ministers in Brussels, we cannot maintain
            our present force strength in Europe indefinitely. These troops have been there for the
            23 years since the end of World War II. Certainly this was never contemplated but, as
            justification for this, there has been no war in Europe for 23 years. Dr. Schroeder said
            that also this has allowed 23 years of Communist history to go by. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName> commented that the President fully supports our
            European force posture, but it is up to us to persuade the Congress that now is the
            wrong time for drastic cuts. He expressed the view that we can defeat the <persName corresp="#p_SWS2">Symington</persName> approach but we may have to find some kind of
            concession. The tree that bends a little with the wind can survive where the tree that
            stands too rigidly may fall.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Schroeder said that he appreciated this explanation and would like to say two
            things. First, the question of US forces in Europe cannot be considered without also
            considering Vietnam. He noted Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName>'s
            cautious expression of limited hopes for an agreement in Vietnam and said that he
            assumed that such an agreement would take away some of the pressure. Secondly, he agrees
            that developments in the Soviet Bloc should help show that now is a poor time to change
            the balance of forces in Europe. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName>'s
            comments to the Ministers in May were accepted without unrest. Dr. Schroeder also called
            attention to the pragmatic view shown by the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> in the
            trilateral discussions on redeployment and rotation. The impact of withdrawing forces
            depends on the way it is done and surrounding circumstances. In this connection, he
            asked for comments on US strategic mobility, remarking that, without it, the concept of
            reinforcing would remain “vague and in the air.”</p>
                    <p>Mr. Nitze observed that we have worked very hard on strategic mobility for the last
            five years. Three factors are significant: (1) Pre-positioning of equipment, so that
            only men have to be moved; (2) air mobility resources—the development of the C–5s
            provides this capability at a cost of about 1.4 cents per ton mile; (3) Fast Deployment
            Logistics Ships. On the last of these, authority for construction has been sought for
            three years. Politically, we have tried to bite off a great deal. The FDL concept
            involved a new and modern shipyard and series production, as in the case of the C–5. The
            shipyard has now been built in Pascagoula, Mississippi and a highly satisfactory ship
            design has been obtained. We are <pb n="725" xml:id="pg_725" facs="0755"/>now trying for
            four FDLs and may get two. Their production would take two or three years. 30 FDLs and
            the C–5s would enable us to reinforce with two divisions in 30 days. These facts have
            clear implications for our readiness. Our air squadrons obviously are clearly
            deployable. From the military standpoint, the same forces in Europe should be maintained
            and this increased strategic mobility be used to reinforce and not as a substitute. We
            have already achieved a ten-fold improvement in mobility since 1961. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName> noted that many of the supporters of the FDL
            would, however, expect that its development would yield some cuts in our forces in
            Europe.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Nitze explained that a further argument presented by Senator <persName corresp="#p_SWS2">Symington</persName> and others is the disproportionate share of the
            European defense burden borne by the United States. Such critics maintain that the
            defense of Europe is not taken as seriously by the Europeans as it is by us. This kind
            of argument was easier to answer in the days of the offset agreement. The present
            efforts at neutralization are welcome, but they represent just a postponement of the
            problem.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Nitze observed that developments in the past several years have made <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> much more capable, whereas previously it could present
            only a nuclear response. Maintenance of this flexible response capability requires a
            certain level of force. Our common goal should be to find ways to make it continuously
            possible to maintain these force levels.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Schroeder conceded that European efforts could be greater and should be greater. He
            noted, however, that European Parliaments are difficult to control. In his opinion, the
            Alliance needs more from the United States than a promise of help if it is to remain
            viable. The substantial US presence provides a tremendous power for cohesion,
            particularly for <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> in 1969. He voiced his
            recognition of the fact that we could come up with more convincing arguments for our
            Congress than he could. He is convinced, however, that the physical presence of the
            leading power in the Alliance remains essential. The maintenance of an adequate level of
            defense effort by the other allies needs study, although 1969 is an election year in the
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> as well. Although he recognizes that we must take
            the Southeast Asia situation into consideration, he is convinced that Europe remains of
            primary importance to the security of the United States as well as to its European
            allies.</p>
                    <p>Insofar as the balance of payments is concerned, Dr. Schroeder observed that the
            situation has been somewhat alleviated. Although he agrees that a long-range program on
            balance of payments is needed, he voiced the view that 1969 is a bad year for exerting
            pressure on this point since 1969 is the year that countries can withdraw from <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Nitze responded that the real issue is whether we have long-range hopes for
            equalizing the balance of payments. In this respect, we need a plan. Although we can
            appreciate the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>'s desires for its own air <pb n="726" xml:id="pg_726" facs="0756"/>industry and its interest in a consortium, the question
            of a follow-on airplane must also be examined from the standpoint of offset, economy and
            relative effectiveness.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Schroeder called attention to the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>'s latest
            procurement requests to Parliament. These involve 134 helicopters, at a cost of 1.4
            billion <gloss target="#t_DM1">DM</gloss>s; 88 F–4 Phantoms, at a cost of 2.5 billion
              <gloss target="#t_DM1">DM</gloss>s; production of additional F–104 Starfighters under
            US license. He asserted that this shows cooperation on the part of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. He also remarked that placing some part of the orders in
            the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> would make it easier politically for these
            programs to continue.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the follow-on aircraft, Dr. Schroeder explained that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> plans to replace its F–104s and G–91s by a single
            aircraft in the mid-70s. They have sought the support of other aircraft-producing
            countries, including the United Kingdom. The objective is not to build an independent
            industry but to facilitate European cooperation and cohesiveness. A similar arrangement
            exists with the United States on the Main Battle Tank 70. In its aircraft proposal, the
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> hopes to strengthen European development
            capability and to include the United Kingdom, although this is sometimes not easy. He
            repeated that the aim is not to build a costly aircraft industry.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Schroeder introduced the question of the supplemental agreement on Main Battle Tank
            70. This supplement provides for an increase in the funding for research and
            development. Mr. Nitze said that he believed that the supplemental funding agreement
            should be signed but that it should be recognized that no decision on actual production
            has been made. Dr. Schroeder reported that he now has approval from his Finance Office
            to sign the agreement and feels that the development project should continue because of
            its political and symbolic value, whatever the eventual results may be. He recognized
            that signing the supplemental agreement would commit neither side to production or
            procurement. Dr. Schroeder and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName> then
            each signed two copies of the agreement in English and two copies in German.</p>
                    <p>There was brief discussion about what should be said to the press. Dr. Schroeder
            suggested that no communiqué would be necessary and that any comments to the press could
            be very general.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Schroeder also expressed the hope that Mr. and Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName> would take the occasion of the <gloss target="#t_NPG1">NPG</gloss> meeting in Bonn on October 10th and 11th to spend an additional day
            either before or after these meetings. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName> said that he was planning to come to the meeting with Mrs.
              <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName> and would hope that his schedule would
            permit him to come a day earlier.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Nitze said that he would like to raise two other things before the meeting
            adjourned. First, on the balance of payments, it would be helpful to exchange views in
            September on long-range solutions. Dr. Schroeder <pb n="727" xml:id="pg_727" facs="0757"/>expressed the opinion that the respective chairmen for such discussions should be
            provided by the foreign offices. He agreed tentatively to a date in September, but said
            that this should be confirmed through diplomatic channels. There was general agreement
            that these talks would take place in Bonn.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Nitze's second point was an elaboration on the subject of a follow-on aircraft for
            the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. This involves very important considerations,
            both from the standpoint of offset and the strategic questions of how best to handle the
            air-to-air and close air support missions. It is, in his view, essential to avoid any
            misunderstanding. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName> asked how far
            thinking on this subject has progressed in Dr. Schroeder's country. Dr. Schroeder said
            that their Parliament was providing 30 million <gloss target="#t_DM1">DM</gloss>s in
            support for the conceptual phase. The United Kingdom desires present a complicating
            factor. He proposed that the US and the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> could remain
            in close contact on this question and that our representative in Bonn should get in
            touch with the Defense Ministry after the next meeting of the consortium, probably in
            September. He reiterated his statement that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> is
            not seeking to develop either a separate or autonomous aircraft industry or a separate
            “European component.” At the present time, he does not even know who the final partners
            will be. He said that he would welcome US support, specifically in the form of
            competition in the engine field with <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> firms and
            competition in avionics.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Nitze emphasized that the strategic and balance of payments problems which are
            involved should have priority over the problem of production. He noted that the entire
            subject should be explored thoroughly at some time. Dr. Schroeder repeated his offer to
            provide more information after the next consortium meeting. Mr. Nitze said that this
            would be helpful, but that a full discussion would remain necessary.</p>
                    <p>At one point in the discussion, Captain Zimmerman was asked to join the group to report
            on the work of the Joint Task Force on the problem of consultation prior to selective
            release of nuclear weapons on or from German soil. He explained the report and the draft
            letters and said that two questions remain open. The first of these is whether the
            arrangements should be between governments or between the President of the United States
            and the Chancellor of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. The second relates to the
            form of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> response. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> has a standard response which quotes the letter received and notes
            concurrence. Captain Zimmerman said that, during the Task Force deliberations, the US
            representatives had complained that this form was tantamount to one party saying “I love
            you” and the other saying “I agree.”</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName> said that the arrangement for
            consultations between the President and the Chancellor appeared acceptable and Mr. Nitze
            noted that this was what would happen in an emergency anyway. Dr. Schroe-der expressed
            willingness to accept our form of response.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Rostow, in referring to the meeting Minister <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> had had with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName> earlier in the day,<note n="2" xml:id="d283fn2">A memorandum of
              their conversation is in Department of State, Central Files, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_GER1">GER</gloss> W–US.</note> said that, according to an old
            Chinese proverb, there were two sides to any crisis: danger and opportunity. Thus all of
            the recent financial crises had contributed to move the international monetary system
            forward on to a new basis. He emphasized the importance of holding on to the present
            two-tier gold system and making it work; and called attention to the need for
            U.S.-German collaboration in avoiding a devaluation of the franc. He endorsed the
            Minister's proposal for directly exporting German capital to the US. He recalled
              <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName>' argument, on the occasion of the
              <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> funeral, for U.K. entry into the Common
            Market and asked: What were the Minister's views on Europe now?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> replied he had had no reason so far
            to change his views of the past. Some of the past arguments for European unity, however,
            were not considered as credible by many as they used to be. For instance, the argument
            that Europe would have to stand united because of the threat from the Soviet Union. This
            was drowning in the détente euphoria.</p>
                    <p>He had discovered that people were more inclined to accept an argument as convincing if
            they saw the maintenance of their living stand-ard endangered. Saying, “You will suffer
            the fate of Spain or Portugal if you do not unite,” was at present much more
            effective.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rostow inquired if the Minister was in agreement with the views of
            Servan-Schreiber.</p>
                    <pb n="729" xml:id="pg_729" facs="0759"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> stated that in principle he was in
            agreement and he had even written the foreword to the German translation of “The
            American Challenge.” He said, in order to help Europe wake up, it might be a good idea
            if the US confronted Europe with the prospect of a substantial withdrawal of US troops
            from Europe in the foreseeable future. However, a credible presence should remain.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rostow asked what Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> considered to
            be a credible presence.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> replied that two divisions with the
            necessary support troops and air support might be considered a credible presence. A US
            contingent of that magnitude would considerably facilitate the working out of a
            permanent financial offset agreement. The financial aspect, however, was not his main
            concern. Europe was in danger of degenerating and getting weak. The mentality prevailed
            to enjoy the current prosperity to the fullest, to cultivate one's garden in the quiet
            corner of world politics, and let the US worry about the rest. This did not just
            over-burden the US militarily and financially but was also beginning to fray the nerves
            of the American people, while the moral fibre of the Europeans was beginning to
            weaken.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rostow remarked that, once France had been brought back to a policy of European
            integration, one should try to shape a policy that would put the US somewhere halfway
            between total responsibility and isolation. President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> was trying in many parts of the world to pursue a policy of
            building “regionalism.” He cited examples in Latin America, Southeast Asia, and
            Africa.</p>
                    <p>The President was anxious to leave to his successor a strong <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. But it was necessary, in order to ensure continued presence of the US
            in Europe in the face of strong Congressional opposition and the Southeast Asia
            conflict, to work out a reasonable financial formula for the long run. Once the big
            planes would become available, it may be appropriate to think of a different pattern of
            US troop deployment. Meanwhile it was necessary to neutralize fully the US balance of
            payments cost of keeping those troops in Europe and thus to buy time for a rational
            solution.</p>
                    <p>In the face of the developments in the East, it was of paramount importance for the
            West to present to the East a picture of maximum poise, power, and unity rather than the
            picture of a disintegrating West.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> declared himself in full agreement
            with those views.</p>
                    <p>He said that Chancellor Kiesinger was ready to try a new approach to General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>, in order to move him in the direction of
            integration.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rostow remarked it would be a grand thing for <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName> to say now, after the recovery of the Pound and the stabilization of
            sterling balances, that Britain could be considered fit to enter the Common Market.</p>
                    <pb n="730" xml:id="pg_730" facs="0760"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> said there were mainly two
            obstacles: the first, because of its currency problems, Britain would not be in a
            position to abandon all tariffs.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FER1">Fried</persName> interjected that he believed Britain
            was capable of doing so.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> said Britain may not be prepared to
            enter into full competition. France certainly would not.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FER1">Fried</persName> remarked Britain should prove fully
            the equal of France in a battle of competition.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> continued: the second, more
            difficult problem was in the field of agriculture. In addition to having to drop
            preferential arrangements with Canada, etc., Britain would have to pay substantial sums
            into the Brussels fund as an agricultural importer. Germany, being in a similar
            position, was paying one billion Deutschmark more into the fund annually than it was
            getting back, while France was pocketing a profit of about the same amount.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rostow asked the Minister's opinion on the Czech situation and on Mr. <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>'s intentions.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> replied he considered the Czech
            development very exciting. Most indicators were pointing against a Soviet intervention
            by force. He and Defense Minister Schroeder, by the way, were being accused by the
            Soviets of having come to the US to hatch a plot for Czechoslovakia.</p>
                    <p>On the occasion of <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>'s 75th birthday,
            comments in East and West German newspapers had upgraded <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> considerably. However, <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> seemed to realize instinctively that a Czech-type development was
            in store for him, or at least for his successor. He could brake it down somewhat but not
            bring it to a full stop.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rostow asked how things were looking in German relations with Rumania and
            Yugoslavia.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> described the relations as good. One
            problem was the scarcity of goods that these countries were able to sell to the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. The German Ambassador to Rumania had come up with the
            interesting proposal to finance a chain of tourist hotels throughout Rumania as a means
            of letting Rumania earn some foreign exchange. A “silent infiltration” of the country
            with Western and Yugoslav tourists could be a powerful instrument and dangerous to the
            Soviet position.</p>
                    <p>It had been interesting to note that during a dinner speech in Italy the Rumanian Prime
            Minister had stated that he did not share the view that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> presented a military threat to the Eastern countries. Even Radio Prague,
            in the past notorious for strong anti-German propaganda, had now refrained from such
            attacks and was instead criticizing East Germany. It was also interesting to note that
            the Organisation Gehlen <pb n="731" xml:id="pg_731" facs="0761"/>had filed reports of
            anti-Russian feelings and predicted explosive developments a year ago. It had sounded
            like an incredible fairy tale by an agent at that time. Things must have been cooking
            for quite a while.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rostow remarked that a turning point seemed to have been reached in Eastern Europe
            following the Cuban missile crisis. Between Sputnik and Cuba there had been a trend to
            turn towards the Soviet Union. After Cuba there had been a gradual, slow reorientation
            to the West.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> stated the Germans would have to
            learn to be patient. One of their cardinal mistakes had always been to look for
            short-term solutions. Matters like the reunification of the country demanded a
            long-range perspective. It could only come at the end of a long process of change.</p>

                    <p>(The President, Defense Minister Schroeder, Amb. <persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName>, Ed Fried,
            Freddy Schneider (<gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> Interpreter))</p>
                    <p>The President welcomed Schroeder, said he was delighted to see him again and asked
            about his health and recovery from his heart attack.</p>
                    <p>The President then told Schroeder he had gone over and approved the exchange of letters
            on nuclear consultations. He complimented the drafters on the clarity of the language.
            Schroeder said he was happy to hear of the President's approval because this was an
            issue of importance to the German Government.</p>
                    <p>On Czechoslovakia, Schroeder said no one could be confident of predictions. The
            Russians were operating under a number of restraints: the <pb n="732" xml:id="pg_732" facs="0762"/>effect of their action internally, in Eastern Europe, and in the West.
            The world's memory of Hungary in 1956 also served as a restraint on them now. In answer
            to the President's question, he said that, on balance, he believed the Russians would
            try very hard to de-escalate the crisis and reach a settlement.</p>
                    <p>On the issue of withdrawal of U.S. troops from Europe, the President recalled that we
            faced similar problems a year ago. Some 12 to 13 members of the Democratic Policy
            Committee were for pulling troops out. We said we would study the problem, and with
            Senator Dirksen's help as a responsible opposition leader, we managed to get by. The
            problem is even more serious this year. Senator <persName corresp="#p_SWS2">Symington</persName> is pushing hard on his amendment to the Defense Appropriation
            Bill to cut the number of our troops in Europe to 50,000. This would be disastrous. The
            prospect now is that action on the Appropriation Bill will be put off until after the
            recess.</p>
                    <p>The President said it was essential to keep steady on this issue. We will face a wave
            of isolationism in the United States if we are not careful. The Administration will
            stand firm and do what it can to bring the Congress around. We expect trouble but we are
            not prepared to liquidate our agreements.</p>
                    <p>Wherever possible, we should get rid of fat but we must not cut into any muscle. The
            danger we face in common is a constant danger. There should be no reason for the German
            people to doubt our commitment to facing it with them.</p>
                    <p>Schroeder said he recognized that the balance of payments issue was making the troop
            problem more difficult for us. The interim solution we arrived at this year, and perhaps
            for another year, should dampen it down. But all are agreed that a longer-term solution
            is essential.</p>
                    <p>The President asked Schroeder about progress on <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>.
            Schroeder said they still had problems to thrash out. The President jokingly expressed
            surprise since he understood the Germans had practically written the Treaty as it stands
            now. Schroeder said they would have to wait for the discussion of the non-nuclear powers
            at the end of August and the beginning of September. He personally believed that after
            that meeting the Cabinet would be able to consider the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> favorably. (Amb. <persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName>
            interjected that the Russians were making this very difficult.)</p>
                    <p>The President asked about the Chancellor, expressed gratification for his relations
            with him, and asked Schroeder to give the Chancellor his regards. Schroeder replied that
            the Chancellor was doing well but faced the difficulties inherent in a big majority.</p>
                    <p>Schroeder commented that the developments in France had come as a big surprise. In the
            end <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> had won his majority, but he did so
            by campaigning on the threat of communism—almost an about face from his position before
            the crisis.</p>
                    <pb n="733" xml:id="pg_733" facs="0763"/>
                    <p>More generally, Schroeder remarked that some people, both in and outside of Germany,
            believed that the Germans should be following a bolder policy. What did the President
            think? The President replied that the Germans had been doing well on their present
            course. He could only hope that other countries would do as well.</p>
                    <p>The President expressed his hope that Schroeder would have a good visit in Canada and
            in Alaska.</p>

                    <p>16455. Subject: Ambassador's talk with Chancellor on Czechoslovakia.</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Summary</hi>: The Chancellor made the following principal points:
            the Soviet decision to invade Czechoslovakia is not an isolated matter but represents a
            basic change in Soviet policy toward all of Eastern Europe. “Wise and firm” US
            leadership is essential in the new situation. The US can stop Soviet action against
            Yugoslavia, and hopefully, Romania. The heightened Soviet emphasis on all Eastern
            European states being their private preserve puts the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> in a special and vulnerable position because “half our country is one of
            the states in the Soviet preserve.” Hence <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> efforts
            toward German unity will be sharply attacked. A <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
            summit would be the best means of demonstrating the strength and unity of the West, and
            there are signs that other countries are coming to this view. A meeting between the
            President and <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> is, of course, the
            President's own decision, but if such a meeting takes place it must take on a new and
            different cast, with the President making clear to <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> the gravity and consequences of the new situation created by
            Czechoslovakia. The Chancellor is not optimistic over his chances of <pb n="734" xml:id="pg_734" facs="0764"/>persuading <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName> of the need to stand with the West on Czechoslovakia. The Chancellor
            is sending <persName corresp="#p_BK6">Birrenbach</persName> to the US on September 7 as
            his “special envoy” to represent German views and to learn US view on the response to
            Czechoslovakia. <hi rend="italic">End summary</hi>.</p>
                    <p>2. The conversation took place in a relaxed atmosphere during the evening of September
            4 at the Chancellor's bungalow. Present were the Chancellor, <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_GKTF1">Guttenberg</persName> and
              <persName corresp="#p_OH3">Osterheld</persName>, as well as the Ambassador and the
              <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss>. The Chancellor began by saying he attached
            importance to the conversation with the American Amb on the eve of his trip to the Near
            East. He had debated some as to whether he should go in view of the Czech situation but
            decided that he should do so. Comment: It was clear that the Chancellor attached public
            political importance to this talk before going on his trip. He also clearly felt he
            ought to speak to the American Ambassador after his interview with Tsarapkin.</p>
                    <p>3. The Chancellor said that there are signs that Soviet policy has undergone a basic
            change. The threat to Romania remains very real and Yugoslavia is also menaced.
              <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> is deeply worried and feels “anything is
            possible” from the Soviets now. <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> also is
            disappointed in the Western reaction to date, including the US reaction and, on a quite
            different scale, the <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> reaction. The
            Chancellor said he had always been deeply impressed by a remark which Secretary once
            made to him to the effect that European Communism, because it does not meet the
            realities of the world today, simply will not be able to hold out under “co-existence”
            and that only in China is Communism likely to survive in the longer term. What surprised
            the Chancellor was that the Soviets struck out so soon and so sharply in an effort to
            stop this inevitable internal erosion of European Communism. It was in reality an act of
            desperation and weakness. The Chancellor said he had done everything possible to avoid
            any provocation for Soviet action in the Czech case, including efforts to keep important
            official Germans from even going to Czechoslovakia.</p>
                    <p>4. Throughout the conversation, the Chancellor kept returning to the theme that wise
            and firm US leadership is essential in meeting the situation. The US as the leading
            power in the West must assume the lead. The Chancellor said he recognized our
            difficulties on the eve of an election, but there was really no alternative. He felt
            that by taking a firm line and rallying Western unity, it would be possible for the US
            to deter the Soviet Union perhaps from moving against Romania and especially against
            Yugoslavia. A Soviet move against Yugoslavia would be a most grave event for all our
            security interests.</p>
                    <p>5. Although it is not necessarily a new policy, the categorical emphasis which the
            Soviets now put on all of the “socialist” states being their private preserve poses a
            very special problem for Germany because one part of Germany, the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, is regarded by the Soviets as a part of the Soviet bloc.
            This would seem to mean that all efforts by the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> to
            bring <pb n="735" xml:id="pg_735" facs="0765"/>[about] the German reunification or even
            contacts with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> will be regarded by the Soviet
            Union as a hostile act. With their new emphasis on <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
            Articles 53 and 107,<note n="2" xml:id="d285fn2">For text of the U.N. Charter, signed at
              San Francisco on June 26, 1945, see 59 Stat. 1031.</note> the Soviets are likely to
            use this as a pretext for intervening more directly against the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. Not only in the propaganda sense but also politically, the Soviets are
            likely to be aggressive against the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>6. This may well, among other things, take the form of moves against Berlin. The
            Chancellor said that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> was determined to meet this
            expected, new aggressiveness from the Soviets with calmness but also with firmness. He
            expected also greatly heightened propaganda attacks against the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. (We took this occasion to tell the Chancellor of the helpful
            instructions regarding US willingness to assist in countering Soviet propaganda attacks
            against the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> around the world.)</p>
                    <p>7. The Chancellor said that he stuck by his proposal on the value of a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> summit meeting as an effective means for demonstrating
            the unity of the West. He mentioned that he was encouraged by signs that some countries,
            like the Netherlands and Luxembourg, were showing signs of being favorable to the idea.
            He mentioned also <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> sponsorship. He said that there
            is now a great opportunity for <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and the West.</p>
                    <p>8. The Chancellor referred to rumors of a meeting between the President and <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>. The Chancellor said he would not of course
            presume to advise for or against such a meeting; it was up to the President to decide if
            such a meeting is held. Its main purpose however, must be to bring home to the Soviets
            fully the gravity and consequences of their action in Czechoslovakia and to deter them
            from similar action against other countries. The Chancellor said he realized this would
            change the character of a President-<persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>
            meeting but he felt obligated to say that the Czech invasion created an entirely new
            situation.</p>
                    <p>9. On <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>, the Chancellor said he will be
            meeting him at the end of the month and will of course encourage him to stand more
            closely with the West in reacting to Czechoslovakia. The Chancellor said he did not know
            how <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> would respond, although he feared
            he would probably still hope to play an independent arbiter role between East and
            West.</p>
                    <p>10. The Chancellor said he felt it was essential that the German Government have close
            contact now with the US because Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName> is unfortunately ill and Minister <persName corresp="#p_LG3">Lilienfeld</persName> has recently left. He is sending <persName corresp="#p_BK6">Birrenbach</persName> as one whom he fully trusts as his personal envoy<note n="3" xml:id="d285fn3">
                            <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> reported on his discussions with
                <persName corresp="#p_BK6">Birrenbach</persName> in telegram 16454 from Bonn,
              September 5. (Department of State, Central Files, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss>
              7 <gloss target="#t_GER1">GER</gloss> W)</note> to talk with key people in the US. The
            Chancellor said that he understood <pb n="736" xml:id="pg_736" facs="0766"/>important
            decisions were being made in Washington at this moment and that he would very much
            appreciate being informed on them.</p>
                    <p>11. In the course of the conversation, the Ambassador made number of points. He said
            that he fully agreed on the great gravity of the situation and knew that it weighed very
            heavily on the President's mind. He also said that he felt it was an hour of real
            opportunity for <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> which had not existed before. The
            Amb also said that the Soviets are paying dearly for their action in Czechoslovakia.
            Their efforts forcibly to put down the spirit of freedom and the desire to share in the
            benefits of modern technology might erode the foundation of Communism in the long run.
            But military success had a certain devastating effectiveness all its own. The Ambassador
            promised to keep in closest contact with the Chancellor on the latest US thinking
            regarding steps to be taken.</p>

                    <p>Dear Mr. Chancellor:</p>
                    <p>This letter is to confirm our understanding concerning consultation between our two
            governments on the use of nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the general release of nuclear weapons, the United States believes that
            in the interest of maintaining the full effectiveness of the nuclear deterrent, no
            special arrangements going beyond the provisions of the Athens Guidelines on
              consultation<note n="2" xml:id="d286fn2">For text of the May 6, 1962, <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> communiqué, released at Athens, see <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current Documents</hi>, 1962, pp. 541–543.</note> are
            desirable.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the selective release of nuclear weapons by the US for use in Germany
            or by forces of the Federal Republic, I can confirm to you the following
            undertakings:</p>
                    <p>1. In order to enable the Government of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> to make
            its views known to the US Government before selective release of nuclear weapons <pb n="737" xml:id="pg_737" facs="0767"/>for use from or on the territory of the Federal
            Republic of Germany and the Soviet Occupied Zone of Germany, the President of the United
            States and the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany will consult directly with
            each other prior to such release.</p>
                    <p>2. The President of the United States will not make selective release of nuclear
            weapons for use by German armed forces if the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of
            Germany objects to such release.</p>
                    <p>The United States Government regards the above undertakings as being in amplification
            and support of the Athens Guidelines on consultation.</p>
                    <p>It is my understanding that to avoid any possible impairment of the nuclear deterrent,
            knowledge of these undertakings will be limited to our two governments and that they
            will not be made public. Should any public statements regarding the subject matter of
            this letter be necessary, such statements will be the subject of prior agreement between
            our governments.<note n="3" xml:id="d286fn3">In his September 17 reply, Chancellor
              Kiesinger stated that the German Government was in accord with the understanding

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BK6">Birrenbach</persName> said he was here at Kiesinger's
            request to explain the German viewpoint on developments in Czechoslovakia. Before coming
            here <persName corresp="#p_BK6">Birrenbach</persName> had long talks with the
            Chancellor, Minister of Defense Schroeder, and Foreign Minister Brandt. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> thinks that the strategic situation in Europe has been
            altered: there are now 15 Soviet divisions in Western Czechoslovakia; 40 Soviet
            divisions west of the Vistula; they have 30 divisions in a high state of readiness; the
            Soviets have proved that they can move much faster than we had realized.</p>
                    <p>Soviet policy had changed after the Bratislava and Karlovy-Vary meetings into one of
            repression of any signs of independence among the bloc countries. The change in Soviet
            policy is based on a wrong appreciation of the Dubcek experiment. Within the bloc,
            Poland is stagnating; the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, Bulgaria and Hungary are
            under complete control. The Soviets simply cannot understand Western reactions. They are
            misjudging the situation in the West on the basis of the French reaction, United States
            involvement in Southeast Asia, reductions and rotations in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> forces, the force ceiling of about 460,000 men on the German
            contribution to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, etc.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_BK6">Birrenbach</persName> continued that the Soviets are taking
            advantage of what they think are these signs of Western weakness to try to isolate the
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> is
            accused of being solely responsible for European tensions because of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>'s refusal to accept the five conditions laid down by the
            Karlovy-Vary meeting (recognition of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>,
            Oder-Neisse Line, division of Germany, special status of Berlin, and total nuclear
            renunciation). The Soviets referred in their Notes of November 21, 1967 and July 5,
              1968,<note n="2" xml:id="d287fn2">For texts, see <hi rend="italic">Documents on
                Germany</hi>, 1944–1985, pp. 971 and 1017–1022.</note> to Articles 53 and 107 to
            suggest that these gave the Soviets right to intervene in Germany. Tsarapkin in his
            recent talks with Kiesinger had raised this issue in a brutal way. Tsarapkin had charged
            the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> with fomenting unrest in Czechoslovakia; he had
            called the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> détente policy “interference” in the
            internal affairs of a socialist country. He had threatened severe consequences to the
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> if the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
            persisted in its policies. He had identified <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> policy
            with the program of the <gloss target="#t_NPD1">NPD</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_BK6">Birrenbach</persName> said that there was now fear in the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> that these Tsarapkin complaints could lead to further East German
            pressures on Berlin accesses.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BK6">Birrenbach</persName> said that as a result of the Czech
            developments and the Tsarapkin communication, <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
            Ostpolitik is completely blocked; movement toward détente and the policy of working
            toward disarmament are <pb n="739" xml:id="pg_739" facs="0769"/>under serious question;
            there is unrest among the European neutral countries as well as Romania and Yugoslavia;
            and popular morale in Berlin has suffered. Germany's Eastern, European and Atlantic
            policies are all in difficulties. The first two may have consequences in the next
            election by improving the prospects of the <gloss target="#t_NPD1">NPD</gloss>. Some
              <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> concepts, on the strategic situation, require
            force levels, and political warning time need examination.<note n="3" xml:id="d287fn3">See page 6. [Footnote in the source text. Reference is to the last paragraph of the
              memorandum.]</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that with respect to <persName corresp="#p_BK6">Birrenbach</persName>'s political analysis we can agree with most of it. The Soviet
            intervention in Czechoslovakia was a rude shock to those affected with the euphoria of
            détente. We have been concerned about excessive détente euphoria for some time. For the
            present, most <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries have adopted the view that
            there should be a reduction in the number of friendly exchanges, particularly the more
            visible ones. For the longer run, consultation in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
            is necessary.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary added that he had to take exception to the statement about our
            concentration on Southeast Asia, with the implication that this meant we were neglecting
            European problems and that this had encouraged the Soviets in Czechoslovakia.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary compared the Soviet defamation of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
            with the defamation of Israel in the Arab world. The defamation of Israel among the Arab
            countries is the only thing they can agree on, and therefore it is important to them.
            Similarly, the Soviets hope to build up East European unity by concentrating on the
            Federal Republic.</p>
                    <p>We are trying to help counter this Soviet defamation; we have informed the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, for example, that we are prepared to send appropriate
            instructions to all our Embassies. As for Articles 53 and 107 of the United Nations
            Charter, we ought to get that problem out of the way promptly. The Articles actually are
            empty. They don't have the slightest effect on <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
            commitments. The Soviets know that if they try anything in Germany it means war. It is
            as simple as that.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BK6">Birrenbach</persName> said that this should be made quite
            clear to the Russians.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that broadly speaking we see things the same way. For the short
            term, the outlook in Eastern Europe is negative. For the longer run, however, trends in
            Eastern Europe toward greater independence and liberalization are irreversible. They are
            practical necessities.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BK6">Birrenbach</persName> asked whether this was also true for
            the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he thought this was the case.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary said that the Soviet intervention in Czechoslovakia was really not
            surprising. The fact that the Soviets felt compelled to <pb n="740" xml:id="pg_740" facs="0770"/>do it was a tribute to the success of Western policy in Eastern Europe.
            What we need is a strong alliance and a collective policy toward Eastern Europe.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that East-West relations have, of course, been complicated by the
            Czech developments. The fact that the Soviets were willing to accept all the
            disadvantages of intervention—involving risks to their bilateral relations with the
            Western countries, Soviet relations with the other communist states and parties, and
            many other risks—is not a good omen. But this doesn't make the other pressing problems
            disappear. The problems of nuclear missiles, Viet-Nam, the Middle East—all require
            solutions. We've all got to give some thought to the problem of getting somewhere in
            these matters despite Czech events.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BK6">Birrenbach</persName> asked whether there was still some
            possibility of a meeting between the President and <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary replied that there is no plan for such a meeting now. He called <persName corresp="#p_BK6">Birrenbach</persName>'s attention to the President's press statement
            to this effect.<note n="4" xml:id="d287fn4">For text, see <hi rend="italic">Public
                Papers of the Presidents of the United States: <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B.

                            </hi>, 1968, Book II, p. 928.</note> He pointed out that in a matter of this kind,
            nothing is final.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary pointed out that in dealing with weapons of the new kind, such as
              <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>'s, governments reach a point of decision from
            which they can't turn back. This has a bearing on the problem.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that on warning time <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> had had
            good advance knowledge of the movement and the order of battle of the Soviet forces.
            What we did not have was a warning about their decision to march. Of course, the time
            and forces required for a move against the West is an entirely different thing than that
            required to move against Czechoslovakia. It may be that the amount of political warning
            time has now been cut somewhat. We have to look carefully at this. But the concept of
            political warning time has not been eliminated.</p>

                    <p>238769. Subject: Brandt Letter to Secretary.</p>
                    <p>1. The following is text of English translation letter from <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> Brandt, delivered to Secretary September 10:</p>
                    <p>“Dear <persName>Dean</persName>,</p>
                    <p>“I thank you sincerely for your letters of 2 and 6 September 1968.<note n="2" xml:id="d288fn2">Not found.</note> On the same day that I received your letter of
            September 6, I asked Ambassador Cabot Lodge to inform you that I felt that a meeting of
            foreign ministers before 10 October would be most useful. Our other thoughts in this
            connection have been discussed by the ambassador and State Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DGF3">Duckwitz</persName>.</p>
                    <p>“In reply to your letter of 2 September, I wish to confirm that the events in
            Czechoslovakia and the resultant change in the strategic situation in Central Europe
            have been a source of great concern in the government and public in the Federal Republic
            of Germany. The government, parliament and the public are convinced that, as a
            consequence of the Soviet aggression, the Atlantic and European structures urgently need
            strengthening so that the long-term peace policy we all desire can be continued.</p>
                    <p>“For this reason I was pleased to comply with your suggestion that talks might be held
            with the French Government on the basis of the Franco-German Treaty of January 22, 1963
            on the question of French cooperation in Western defense. On September 7, Foreign
            Minister <persName corresp="#p_DM4">Debre</persName> and I had one of the consultations
            at ministerial level provided for in that treaty.</p>
                    <p>“According to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DM4">Debre</persName>, the French government
            are of the opinion that a return to the cold war will have to be prevented. On the other
            hand, they feel there can be no question of continuing the policy of détente as long as
            Soviet troops remain in Czechoslovakia, and that whilst economic relations between East
            and West should be developed further the Soviet Union should again and again be given
            the responsibility of restoring the conditions essential to the continuation of the
            policy of détente.</p>
                    <p>“With regard to military security, I suggested to <persName corresp="#p_DM4">Debre</persName> that the present Franco-German study group for problems of European
            security in <pb n="742" xml:id="pg_742" facs="0772"/>the seventies should make a
            concrete assessment of the military situation in view of the changes caused by the
            events in Czechoslovakia. <persName corresp="#p_DM4">Debre</persName> agreed with this
            proposal.</p>
                    <p>“I am not sure whether the proposed security talks will eventually bring France closer
            to joint defense efforts of the alliance. Nevertheless, I think they will provide a
            favorable opportunity to gain a better idea of French views and intentions and to
            explain to the French the conclusions that force themselves upon us on account of the
            events in Czechoslovakia.</p>
                    <p>“As regards the question of a meeting of foreign ministers of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries, the French recommend that the regular
            December ministerial conference should be brought forward a few weeks. In their opinion,
            a meeting of foreign ministers at the present time would be too spectacular and would
            not be in a position to make decisions now. I told <persName corresp="#p_DM4">Debre</persName> that I had agreed to a meeting of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> foreign ministers in the first half of October but would prefer it to be
            held in Washington.</p>
                    <p>“As soon as the planned Franco-German talks on security questions have produced some
            results I shall not fail to inform you about them.</p>
                    <p>“With kind regard, (signed) <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Willy Brandt</persName>”</p>
                    <p>2. Secretary's response will be sent by septel.<note n="3" xml:id="d288fn3">Telegram

                    </p>
                    <p>1. Summary: The Ambassador presented the instructions in the reftel, supplemented by
            State 238789<note n="3" xml:id="d289fn3">Telegram 238789 to Bonn, September 15, reported
              on <persName corresp="#p_BK6">Birrenbach</persName>'s visit to Washington. (Ibid.,
                <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 7 <gloss target="#t_GER1">GER</gloss> W)</note>
            on the <persName corresp="#p_BK6">Birrenbach</persName> visit, to Chancellor Kiesinger.
            The most significant points in the Chancellor's reply were (A) satisfaction with the
              <persName corresp="#p_BK6">Birrenbach</persName> visit, (B) willingness to consider
            later increases in the German defense budget if based on a careful <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> appraisal of the new security situation, (C)
            willingness also, hedged with expressions of real concern to consider at least the
            possibility of defense budget increases to assist us on our military balance of payments
            problem, (D) pessimism regarding the prospects of getting increased collaboration from
              <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>, coupled with no apparent willingness
            by the Chancellor to press him very hard. End summary.</p>
                    <p>2. The conversation, which lasted more than an hour and a half, took place in a
            relaxed, frank atmosphere. <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Carstens</persName> and the <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss> were also present.</p>
                    <p>3. The Chancellor began by saying that he had had only a brief conversation with
              <persName corresp="#p_BK6">Birrenbach</persName>, who was tired after his trip, but
            that he was pleased to learn that the US analysis in all its essentials was the same as
            that of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. The central problem, the Chancellor
            said, is that we are confronted with a serious new military situation, involving a
            forward position of many additional Soviet divisions in Eastern Europe. It was essential
            that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> draw the right conclusions from this
            situation.</p>
                    <p>4. Responding to this, the Ambassador then made the following presentation, based on
            the reftel: the Soviets have done something hazardous in Czechoslovakia which presents
            new dangers for the Western Alliance. We believe there is a strong German and Alliance
            view that a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> response is required in the present
            situation. Without being provocative, such a response should involve specific actions to
            improve the Allied defense position in Europe. It should also be prompt if it is to be
              <pb n="744" xml:id="pg_744" facs="0774"/>effective. A <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Ministerial meeting in the near future would be useful—provided
            substantive results can be achieved. Following our consultations with Germany and other
            members of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, we intend to propose a special meeting
            of the North Atlantic Council at the Permanent Representative level to be held in
            Brussels in late September or early October to determine what governments are willing
            and able to do. The Secretary also plans a dinner October 8 of those <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Foreign Ministers who are in New York. This meeting
            could appraise whether progress on real substance justified a special, early Ministers'
            meeting in Brussels. To sum up the general <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
            situation, the key question is the willingness of Allied governments to take firm
            decisions regarding their contributions to the common defense effort.</p>
                    <p>5. The Ambassador continued that this is a highly important juncture in the development
            of postwar Europe. There is a necessity for real action. To take it can set us ahead and
            start somewhat of a an upward spiral; failure to take it will have serious effects on
            the future of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and of Europe. <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> can be compared to a boat in front of a boathouse on a
            lake; it either goes forwards or backwards; it does not stay still. All <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries—in common indeed with countries
            everywhere—confront complex domestic and international difficulties. This may perhaps be
            truer for the US at present than for others because of our elections. Certainly what is
            done between now and the end of this year in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> will
            have a very strong effect on the new American government, whoever heads the government.
            Germany is the country most directly affected by the Soviet move in Czechoslovakia. If
            Germany shows within <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> that it thinks the situation
            is sufficiently serious for them to take concrete steps, then we are confident that this
            will lead to positive action by others. This means decisions on the military budget,
            both in the sense of money spent for Germany's own forces and for balance of payments
            purposes arising from the presence of US forces. A statesmanlike German decision on this
            latter subject could be politically very important in determining the position of the
            new American government. The Chancellor has heard the talk of a decline in the American
            public interest in Europe in recent years. The Czechoslovak events present an
            opportunity to reverse this trend if positive action is taken to energize <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and resume progress toward European integration. They
            also present a risk of its intensification if action is not taken.</p>
                    <p>6. The Chancellor replied that he wanted to make the German position clear on increased
            military effort. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> felt that it made no sense, as
            an immediate reflex reaction to the Soviet invasion, to increase indiscriminately the
            German defense budget. Any decisions on the defense budget must be based on a careful
            German and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> study of the new situation. Defense
            Minister Schroeder must first make considered proposals to the Cabinet. He will soon
            have an opportunity to do this in the <pb n="745" xml:id="pg_745" facs="0775"/>form of
            the annual white paper on defense which must be submitted to the Bundestag.</p>
                    <p>7. More specifically, on neutralization of US military expenditures, the Chancellor
            said that he understood the US position. He added that, however, any solutions involving
            an increase in the German defense budget presented very serious problems. It could
            involve a kind of double burden coming on top of any general increase required to
            strengthen the Bundeswehr itself. He pointed to the very great difficulties recently in
            hammering out the budget decisions in the medium term financial plan. Nevertheless, the
            Chancellor said, the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> was prepared to “look very
            carefully into this.”</p>
                    <p>8. Regarding <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>, Chancellor said that he
            will hear from him September 27 how he sees the new situation created by Czechoslovakia,
            but that he does not expect any great change in <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName>'s willingness to cooperate. It is likely that the only positive
            thing which can be expected from <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> is a
            commitment that he will not withdraw from <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> at this
            time. The Chancellor said that the Germans will look into whether it is possible to work
            out more collaboration between <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> forces and French
            forces, but that he was not at all certain that something could be worked out.</p>
                    <p>9. Regarding the situation in general, the Chancellor said that the Germans had no new
            reports of an imminent military threat to Romania or Yugoslavia. The Ambassador pointed
            out that we also had no new information pointing in this direction. The Chancellor said
            that it is now very difficult to predict how the Soviet leadership will react in a given
            situation. The German appraisal is that the Kremlin is a disunited, leaderless team,
            which makes it potentially more dangerous. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>, although he embarked on some very dangerous ventures indeed,
            was sufficiently in charge to back down again when the situation required (e.g. Cuba).
            The difficulty with the present disunited Kremlin team is that it is much harder for it
            to decide to pull back when it has made an obvious mistake. The Chancellor said that,
            although he, like others, could hardly say he predicted the Soviet invasion of
            Czechoslovakia, looking back on it now he realizes that there was a certain
            inevitability to it. There were certain things, both from the point of view of their
            ideology and their strategic views, which the Soviets “simply could not let happen.”
            What their brutal invasion can only mean is that they lost their heads in the Kremlin.
            The Chancellor also felt that Czechoslovakia really went too far; perhaps Dubcek
            realized this, but lost control of the situation. He stressed again, as he had in the
            previous conversation, how the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> had really bent over
            backwards to avoid giving the Soviets any pretext whatever to charge German involvement
            in the liberalization process in Czechoslovakia. He even felt at one point that a
            Western leader <pb n="746" xml:id="pg_746" facs="0776"/>should have warned Dubcek to
            “take it easy” in his contacts with the West.</p>
                    <p>10. On the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> reaction to Czechoslovakia, the
            Chancellor said that he has been concerned with the slow erosion of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> over the past few years. He agreed that the events in
            Czechoslovakia provide a new opportunity for revitalization. He also agreed fully that
            whatever <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> does should not be dramatic, but measured
            and considered. The Chancellor felt a stronger and united <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> does have an effect in Eastern Europe and on the Soviet Union. The
            Soviets will negotiate differently and more responsibly if <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> is stronger and more united. The other Eastern European countries will
            also be heartened. The Chancellor also mentioned, although quite briefly, the need for
            the US to exercise at least full co-leadership in the process of developing a proper
              <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> reaction. The Chancellor concluded by saying
            that “we will do all that it is possible for us to do to bring about a proper <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> response.”</p>
                    <p>11. The Chancellor's comments on his trip to Turkey, Iran and Afghanistan will be
            reported in subsequent message.<note n="4" xml:id="d289fn4">Telegram 17078 from Bonn,

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> had asked to see the
            Secretary either today or on Monday. The Secretary agreed to see him at 12:30 p.m.
            today.</p>
                    <pb n="747" xml:id="pg_747" facs="0777"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> began by referring to the question of
            technical talks on <gloss target="#t_PNED1">PNED</gloss>s (Peaceful Nuclear Explosive
            Devices). He said that the idea of the US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
            meeting on this subject had been at the US initiative, that the US thought it would be
            useful with the non-nuclear conference in Geneva and that the Soviets were now prepared
            to go ahead with the talks on October 7, as suggested by the US. The Secretary asked
            whether this subject had been discussed with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> when he and <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> met the
            other day. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> replied that they had just
            discussed the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> and that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName> did not wish to discuss the <gloss target="#t_PNED1">PNED</gloss>s talks.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that he would have to discuss this question with the President and
            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName>, and that he would let
              <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> know later. He observed that there
            were complications.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that the Executive Branch, as the Ambassador knew, was attempting to
            move the non-proliferation treaty through the Senate. In response to the Ambassador's
            question, he said he thought the matter would not come to a vote before the Fortas
            nomination had been settled,<note n="2" xml:id="d290fn2">Reference is to the nomination
              of Associate Justice Abe Fortas as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.</note> probably
            not until the end of the month.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary then opened up the question of the recent intense Soviet propaganda
            campaign against Germany and Berlin. He said that he wanted to discuss this question
            with real seriousness. There had been a buildup of propaganda, threats and agitation by
            the Soviets against West Germany and Berlin. We have observed an unusual series of
            attacks, charges, use of strong language, including the latest attack of today, by
            Izvestya and Pravda against Germany and Berlin. We had observed the strange
            interpretation by the Soviets of Articles 53 and 107 of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter as a justification for Soviet intervention, as well as the
            astonishing Soviet démarche to the Dutch Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_DJP1">de
              Jong</persName> attempting to dissuade him from making his prospective visit to
            Berlin. He said that the US cannot accept pressures against contacts between Berlin and
            the outside world. We and the other protective powers have a responsibility for Berlin,
            including its economic viability. He said that the Soviet campaign was developing in a
            serious way and asked for Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s
            comments. He asked, “What's behind this?”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said in effect that all of this had been
            precipitated by the Federal Republic and the State Department acting together. As proof
            he observed that the US and allied statements on Articles 53 and 107 had just been
            issued now whereas the Soviet position on these Articles was stated to the Germans as
            long ago as July 1967.<note n="3" xml:id="d290fn3">For text of U.S. statement, see
              Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, October 7, 1968, p. 365. Similar
              statements were made by the United Kingdom and France.</note>
                    </p>
                    <pb n="748" xml:id="pg_748" facs="0778"/>
                    <p>The Secretary said that he hoped there would be no confusion in the Soviet Government
            over the fact that any rights under the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Articles in
            question and the Potsdam Agreement must be multilateral as amongst the four powers (US,
              <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, France and Soviet Union) and cannot be unilaterally
            applied by the Soviets or arrogated to the Warsaw Pact.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then said that while he had nothing
            particular to say on the basis of instructions from Moscow, he would make certain
            personal observations: The Secretary had suggested that there might be the possibility
            of a military attack. He derided this possibility. He suggested that the US was simply
            playing the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> game. He said, “Do you really think we
            would attack? Why are you making such a fuss?”</p>
                    <p>The Secretary then quoted the following excerpt from <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi>,
            dated September 18:</p>
                    <p>“As a participant in the Potsdam agreement, the Soviet Union will continue to stand
            ready, together with other peace-loving states, to take the necessary effective
            measures, if the need arises, to stop the dangerous activities of neo-nazism and
            militarism.”</p>
                    <p>He asked what was the meaning of the phrase “together with other peace loving states”?
            If this meant the US, the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and France, that would be
            one thing; but historically the Soviet Union had never used this phrase to describe the
            countries of the West. This suggested that perhaps the Soviet Union may have meant to
            imply that the Warsaw Pact countries as “peace loving states” were entitled to take this
            action. The Soviet Union and the US had had somewhat different ideas of “militarism” and
            “neo-nazism” in West Germany; but it had, after all, been the East Germans who had moved
            into Czechoslovakia. In July, in August, and now in the middle of September there had
            been a series of menacing statements regarding Germany and Berlin. We are listening to
            these and must listen; we will have to reply and expect to do so; but we want to know
            what is behind this campaign.</p>
                    <p>There was further inconclusive discussion about Articles 53 and 107 of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter, the position of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> under Article 51 of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter and
            the question of the relative priorities between the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
            and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> suggesting that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter was
            superior to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and the Secretary pointing out that
            the two were wholly consistent.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked whether the Secretary was really
            concerned over the possibility of the use of force by the Soviets and its Warsaw Pact
            countries against Germany and Berlin. The Secretary said he was certainly “concerned”,
            but not nervous or afraid; the US would do its duty together with its allies; but we
            want to know what is behind the Soviet campaign. He again reverted to the Soviet attempt
            to dissuade the Dutch Prime Minister from visiting Berlin, describing it as “unheard
            of”. He said that the Soviets had stated that such a visit would lead to “undesirable
            consequences.” He could not recall any such language having been <pb n="749" xml:id="pg_749" facs="0779"/>used under these circumstances during his period of
            office. He asked <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> to explain to the
            Soviet Government the seriousness of the view which we take over the propaganda assault
            and attempts at intimidation being conducted by the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then referred to his earlier message to
            the Secretary of August 31 regarding Berlin.<note n="4" xml:id="d290fn4">For text, see
                <ref target="frus1964-68v17#d90">
                                <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1964–1968, vol. XVII, Document
              90</ref>.</note> In that message the Soviet Union had recognized the state interests
            of the US in Berlin and had stated that any reports about action against Berlin were
            “completely without foundation.” He reaffirmed this message. He added that speaking
            personally he thought that the US was playing a German game and referred to the recent
            visits to Washington of <persName corresp="#p_BK6">Kurt Birrenbach</persName> and Helmut
            Schmidt.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary then pointed out that several Soviet divisions had moved to the West and
            to the South. There were several hundred thousand Warsaw Pact troops in Czechoslovakia
            and substantial additional Soviet forces along the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
            border (Bavaria). This inevitably brings up a problem for <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> interjected to ask, “Do you really
            believe now that this could be a military threat to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>?” (His implicit denial at this point of any military threat to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> ties in with his later remark below to the effect that
            the prime consideration for the Soviet Union is the preservation of the Warsaw Pact
            countries.)</p>
                    <p>The Secretary thought there was the question of Soviet intentions and the question of
            the redeployment of the Warsaw Pact forces which needed looking at both together and
            separately.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> interjected to say that there were the
            same number of Soviet divisions but in a different place.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary, resuming, said that, with respect to Soviet intentions, we do not
            believe at the moment that the Soviets intend a military assault on <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, but there was uncertainty. He said, frankly, we do not
            entirely understand why you did what you did in Czechoslovakia despite the obvious costs
            in your political relations with the US, with Europe and around the world. Therefore, we
            wonder whether there may be elements in the thinking of the Soviet leaders which we do
            not fully understand. He said that it would have been easier for him six months ago to
            make a prediction of what the Soviet Government might do than it would be today.
            Therefore, we and our partners in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> have to take
            note of the redeployment of Soviet forces and have to question again our judgments about
            Soviet intentions and have to consider the two together.</p>
                    <p>At the close of a general discussion about peaceful co-existence, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> made two major points which were clearly not <pb n="750" xml:id="pg_750" facs="0780"/>just his own personal observation, but were in
            line with Moscow instructions:</p>
                    <p>1. The Soviet Union continued to pursue a policy of peaceful co- existence, including
            the promotion of East-West contacts, discussion of important subjects such as <gloss target="#t_PNED1">PNED</gloss>s, etc.</p>
                    <p>2. The Soviet Union would tolerate no weakening in any way of the solidarity or basic
            socialist structure of the Warsaw powers. He was emphatic on this point and said in
            effect “the Warsaw Pact structure must be preserved intact, and that's all.”</p>
                    <p>The impression drawn from this conversation is that <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> sought to reassure the Secretary regarding any intention of the
            Soviet Union to use military force against <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>,

                    <p>17480. For the President and the Secretary from <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>.</p>
                    <p>1. This message concerns American policy toward Germany in the light of the invasion of
            Czechoslovakia.</p>
                    <p>2. This event—deeply shocking to virtually all Germans—has resulted in increased
            readiness to provide more money for defense and to move further on European integration,
            including British entry into the <pb n="751" xml:id="pg_751" facs="0781"/>Common Market.
            Although movement in this direction is hesitant and as yet inconclusive, it is more
            positive than any heretofore under the present government and clearly marks a waning of
              <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>'s influence here.</p>
                    <p>3. I welcome this evolution and believe it is in the interests of the US. Conversely, I
            believe that if the Germans do not act now, the opportunity to strengthen <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> in the light of the Czechoslovak crisis will have been
            missed. This will make the invasion of Czechoslovakia an even greater short term Soviet
            success than it is already and will sharply reduce the possibility of converting it into
            a long term Soviet failure.</p>
                    <p>4. If the crisis does not lead to strengthening <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>,
            I believe the result in Germany will be a mood of pessimism and of accommodation towards
            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. The result in the US will be disappointment
            over the lack of European response and continuing pressures to withdraw more American
            troops from Europe. The outcome either way may be a historic turning point. If it is
            negative, it will give impetus to a downward spiral in the US relationship with Europe,
            which, Germans tell me, must eventually result in Western Europe's becoming an enlarged
            Finland.</p>
                    <p>5. The German decision is not firm yet. It may not take final form for several weeks.
            Perhaps the major concern of German leaders with regard to it is that, if they finally
            decide on a go-ahead policy, they will be left in isolation by their Allies, and thus
            exposed to Soviet attack and to both European and German criticism as being hasty and
            foolish “hardliners.”</p>
                    <p>6. I hope I appreciate at least some of the difficulties of your present situation, but
            I believe it most desirable in view of the importance of the German decision to give
            them some encouragement by positive moves of our own in response to some positive prior
            European moves. One such move would be a statement from you that you will recommend to
            the incoming administration that the US should commit itself to continued adherence to
            the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Treaty beyond the 1969 deadline. Another would
            be a similar recommendation to retain at least the present level of troops in Europe in
            the face of the new situation caused by the Soviet intervention in Czechoslovakia, and
            preferably, to return to Europe permanently the two withdrawn brigades of the 24th
            Division.</p>
                    <p>7. The reports about strategic arms talks with the Soviets are a real worry here—at
            whatever level talks might be held. Although I know little of current plans, I accept
            the proposition that a workable arrangement on this subject would be in the interest of
            Europe as well as the US and that the matter should be pursued with the Soviets in the
            future.</p>
                    <p>8. Nonetheless, given the present atmosphere in Germany, a decision apparently to
            reward Soviet aggression by embarking on arms talks would, I fear, be incomprehensible
            here. How, it would be asked, can one <pb n="752" xml:id="pg_752" facs="0782"/>explain a
            willingness to trust the Soviet word when they have just broken it so flagrantly in
            Czechoslovakia?</p>
                    <p>9. Another effect of an expression of US willingness to start talks with the Soviets
            now would put in doubt the judgment and good sense of German leaders in pressing for
            increases in defense. Such a US decision might well eliminate the possibility of a
            positive German decision on our defense.</p>
                    <p>10. You may have a different perspective in Washington. But as I view it, the chance
            for strengthening <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, and the damage which would
            arise from not doing so, outweigh in terms of our national interest the potential gain
            from opening the talks with Soviets this time.</p>

                    <p rend="center">VII. Berlin Contingency Planning</p>
                    <p>US strategic thinking with regard to military contingencies in Berlin have been set out
            in National Security Action Memorandum No. 109 of October 23, 1961 (see Appendix)<note n="2" xml:id="d292fn2">Not printed. For text of <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss>

              521–523.</note> which still provides current US view of the governing sequences and
            graduated responses in a Berlin conflict.</p>
                    <p>Detailed contingency plans are available which have been devised to meet various
            categories of contingencies. By experience we know that rarely does a crisis situation
            exactly meet the developments as they occur. Nevertheless we believe that plans that we
            have are well adapted <pb n="753" xml:id="pg_753" facs="0783"/>and sufficiently flexible
            to meet real situations as they arise. The major kinds of contingencies that might well
            arise in the foreseeable future and the kinds of contingency plans designed to meet them
            are as follows:</p>
                    <p>A. Soviet/<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> action directed against <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> access to Berlin on the ground (road and rail). The
            Soviets may permit the East Germans to take action against <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> travellers instead of Allied traffic because (1) such a course is safer;
            (2) appeases <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>'s claim to sovereignty; (3)
            provides an indirect but very effective way of undercutting Berlin's viability; and (4)
            is a course of action that tends to exploit divisions between the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and its allies. The new passport, visa and tariff
            measures that were instituted in June provide an adequate basis for immediate and
            effective har-assment of <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> travellers.</p>
                    <p>There are three major ways in which <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> travellers to
            and from Berlin could be harassed by the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
            authorities:</p>
                    <p>1. Denial of Berlin access to German travellers on a broad scale, but short of blockade
            conditions. This action could easily be implemented by the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> simply by refusing to issue visas to travellers on trains, busses, and on
            the autobahn.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Allied Response:</p>
                    <p>Depending upon the scale of these actions the Allied Powers would protest in East
            Berlin, the Western capitals, and Moscow, in that order; the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> would certainly protest and warn the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
            through Interzonal Trade channels (<gloss target="#t_IZT1">IZT</gloss> agreement does
            not permit harassment of goods or passengers). There would be an immediate diversion of
            essential <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> travel to the air routes and the Allied
            carriers would add some flights. (Note: an air bus scheme run by Modern Air Transport,
            an American carrier, is well into the discussion stages with the Minister of
            Transport.)</p>
                    <p>2. Interruption of German Cargo Traffic on a significant scale (i.e., more than token
            harassment for 2–3 days) by charging exorbitant fees, applying unreasonable inspection
            standards, false quarantines, excessive delays, or outright denial of access rights.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Allied Response:</p>
                    <p>Protests through diplomatic and <gloss target="#t_IZT1">IZT</gloss> channels, followed
            by <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and Allied economic and political countermeasures
            (e.g. expansion of export control measures; refusal of <gloss target="#t_TTD1">TTD</gloss>'s). Some limited transport of special cargoes by Allied train or by air
            cargo might well be attempted at an early stage, but not on a large scale.</p>
                    <p>3. Complete and sustained blockage of <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> traffic,
            passenger and cargo, while less likely than harassment, provides the Allies with one of
            their most difficult contingency problems.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Allied Response:</p>
                    <p>Aside from attempting to blunt the immediate effects of blockade by shifting passengers
            and cargo to air transport (which can be har-assed <pb n="754" xml:id="pg_754" facs="0784"/>—“Harassment of Air Corridors,” below), no immediate relief is at hand.
            Complete blockage of German rail, road and barge traffic certainly would be followed by
            a period of intense diplomatic activity, expanding airlift implementation, breaking off
            of <gloss target="#t_IZT1">IZT</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>-wide
            implementation of more serious Allied economic political and even military
            countermeasures (e.g. augmentation of Berlin military forces, increase in Allied
            military traffic, publicized buildup of Berlin stockpiles). If the blockage persisted
            and a significant economic, physical and/or psychological threat is posed to Berlin, the
            Allies will consider taking civilian ground access under their auspices. If, as a result
            of the failure to end the blockade of civilian traffic, Allied travel also became
            blocked, Allied contingency planning would be applicable (see below). Since Allied
            access to Berlin for military travel is a matter of formal agreement and of Allied right
            (which the Soviets have formally recognized over the years), tampering with Allied
            access, in any form, is much riskier for the Soviets and poses a threat of general war.
            A number of contingency plans to determine exactly what Soviet intentions are in a given
            situation exist.</p>
                    <p>B. Interference with Allied access can come either by blockage of the Berlin/Helmstedt
            autobahn by the Soviets or East Germans, or by blockage of the Allied Military trains
            between Helmstedt and Berlin.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Allied Response:</p>
                    <p>The first aim of all contingency plans in this area is to determine Soviet/<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> intentions. For example, the tripartite armed train probe
            is designed solely as a test of Soviet/East German intent to use force to stop the daily
            Allied trains. One thrown switch or one removed section of track, if backed up by
              Soviet/<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> force to prevent the Allies from put-ting
            the track in order, would establish this point.</p>
                    <p>Similarly, a contingency plan for a company-level probe up the autobahn from Helmstedt
            is designed solely as a test of Soviet/East German intent to use force to keep the
            autobahns closed. This contingency is available for use following failure of diplomatic
            initiatives. We have also planned a second probe from the Helmstedt end of the autobahn,
            consisting of a reinforced battalion combat team which is designed to achieve one of two
            political objectives: (1) provide circumstances under which negotiations with the
            Soviets might prove fruitful, or, (2) compel the Soviets to face the imminence of
            general war. The purpose of the battalion probe is not to fight its way through to
            Berlin but to demonstrate Allied determination and to test the extent to which the
            Soviets may be willing to use force.</p>
                    <p>Finally, there is available a tripartite division-size force, again available for
            operations from the Helmstedt end of the autobahn. It is assembled under tripartite
            aegis upon the decision of governments, but to be implemented only under the command and
            control of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, since use of a force of that size
            through <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> territory obviously has implications <pb n="755" xml:id="pg_755" facs="0785"/>for all of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.
            (One of its missions would be to extricate the battalion combat team probe.)</p>
                    <p>C. Harassment in the Air Corridors to Berlin</p>
                    <p>Soviet aircraft could undertake a campaign of harassment of civil flights traveling in
            and out of Berlin through the three air corridors set up by the Western Allies and the
            Soviets in 1946. Air access is solely an Allied responsibility and only Allied civilian
            and military aircraft fly the Berlin routes. However, the Soviets may permit harassment
            of civil Allied flights because they are carrying—or are alleged to be
            carrying—categories of <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> passengers forbidden by the
              <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> to travel in and out of Berlin.</p>
                    <p>Soviet air harassment would probably take the form of large numbers of Soviet military
            flights in the corridors, some of which might buzz or otherwise worry our civil flights
            in the corridors. (This could follow an initial demand by the Soviets that the Allies
            permit <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials to screen <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> passengers at West Berlin airports, ostensibly to determine individuals
            forbidden to travel across East German territory.)</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Allied Response:</p>
                    <p>Initial Allied response to air harassment would take the form of protests through the
            Soviet controller in the Berlin Air Safety Center and Allied notes to the Soviet
            Ambassador in East Berlin. If civil air travel becomes clearly hazardous because of
            near-misses with Soviet flights or other dangerous moves by the Soviet aircraft, Allied
            plans call for unarmed military air transports, one from each Power, to provide an
            immediate response and a test of Soviet intentions. These flights are presently on six
            hours' stand-by. (In the event that air harassment is carried out by East German air
            units, the Allies would treat the Soviets as nonetheless responsible and continue to
            deal only with them.)</p>
                    <p>Contingency plans exist to cover the possibility of Soviet withdrawal from the Berlin
            Air Safety Center and include the situation of an attempted East German filling of the
            vacated Soviet position. These plans are currently under active review. In any case, the
            Allies will continue to hold the Soviets solely responsible and will attempt to pass on
            flight information to Soviet authorities in East Berlin as a flight safety measure.
            Rapid political advice to the Allied controllers in the Berlin Air Safety Center is of
            course essential.</p>
                    <p>In the event civil air carriers cease to operate, Allied plans provide for
            military-sponsored air service (<gloss target="#t_MSAS1">MSAS</gloss>), using civil
            aircraft either under government contract or with military crews. <gloss target="#t_MSAS1">MSAS</gloss>, which would operate initially without passengers,
            would keep Allied civil air access alive, help replenish Berlin stockpiles, and
            establish Soviet/<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> intentions. If Soviet/<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> action were to result in damage or loss of an Allied
            civil aircraft, tripartite plans call for possible fighter aircraft escort flights,
            subject to national approval at each stage of implementation.</p>
                    <pb n="756" xml:id="pg_756" facs="0786"/>
                    <p>D. Naval Countermeasures</p>
                    <p>A number of NAVCONS (Naval Contingencies) were approved by the WAG in 1967. While
            detailed planning is the responsibility of the appropriate national authority, a wide
            range of possible countermeasures affecting naval and maritime activities is now
            available which could be implemented in time of crisis. Prior to implementation a
            national decision would have to be made in each case, which probably would be
            coordinated through the WAG. As conceived, the naval countermeasures include a flexible
            and escalating series of moves including:</p>
                    <p>1. In-port harassment of <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>/Bloc shipping</p>
                    <p>2. In-port seizure of lend-lease ships</p>
                    <p>3. Delays and administrative harassment of shipping in Kiel and Panama canals</p>
                    <p>4. Intensified surveillance of submarines and surface vessels</p>

                    <p>E. Air Harassment of Berlin</p>
                    <p>Activity inside West Berlin proscribed by the Soviets or East Germans, such as <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> meetings, may be expected to stimulate Soviet/<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> air activity over the city. These have in the past taken
            the form of frequent sonic booms and low-level jet flights over West Berlin “targets”
            such as the Reichstag building, where Bundestag (Parliamentary) committees meet while in
            Berlin. Soviet helicopters may also intrude an unwelcome presence over the city. The
            effect of such harassment is mainly psychological, although there can be serious dangers
            to Allied civil and military flights using West Berlin's three airfields. Berliners have
            shown that they can take a heavy sonic pounding, at least for periods of several days at
            a time, without showing undue strain.</p>
                    <p>Allied Response is limited to protests to the Soviets through the Berlin Air Safety
            Center and through diplomatic channels.</p>
                    <p>F. Threats to the Continuation of Allied Control of the Western Sectors of Berlin</p>
                    <p>Extensive plans for the defense of Berlin in the event of attacks on the very existence
            of Free Berlin, whether from internal insurrection (coup de main) or military attack
            from outside the city, exist.</p>
                    <p>Efforts aimed at a “spontaneous” uprising by the <gloss target="#t_SED1">SED</gloss>
            directed against Berlin authority can be contained by the 15,000 Berlin police now in
            Berlin, supported by the 10,000 Allied troops in the city. If the East Germans make a
            determined effort at a take-over which might get out of <pb n="757" xml:id="pg_757" facs="0787"/>hand, augmentation of the Berlin military forces (from the nearby <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>) always remains a possibility.</p>
                    <p>The control of civil disturbances is primarily a Berlin policy responsibility, but
            Allied planning is based on the assumption that the only way to counter the enemy threat
            of surprise is for every military and police unit to have detailed orders to secure
            points vital to the defense of Berlin in the following order or priority: (a) countering
            a potential military threat, (b) maintaining law and order, (c) re-establishing Allied
            control within West Berlin. If hostile elements penetrate border defenses, defensive
            positions call for falling back on a series of shortened lines while protecting vital
            internal communications lines. Troop commanders will see that S- and U-Bahn lines are
            closed, will block canals, keep railway repair yards under surveillance, maintain ready
            reserves, pacify areas under their control and keep on the alert for a direct military
            attack in support of the initial civil disturbance or surprise attack.</p>
                    <p>In the event of a military attack, the Allies plan to secure strong points in the city
            and secure the most vital lines of communication. Plans are based on a prior alert time
            of twenty minutes.</p>

                    <p>I have gone over the Berlin situation with my people in light of the Kraemer paper I
            sent to you.<note n="2" xml:id="d293fn2">On October 3, Rostow presented President
                <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> with an untitled memorandum on the
              policy of the East German Government by Fritz Kraemer, “an extremely intelligent
              civilian who works in the Department of the Army.” (Ibid.)</note> This is the way we
            see it:</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Military Indications</p>
                    <p>There is no significant change since Czechoslovakia in the Soviet military threat
            against Berlin. Their increased forces in Czechoslovakia <pb n="758" xml:id="pg_758" facs="0788"/>cut down what they can mount immediately against Berlin. But the roads
            are good and they can change force dispositions in a day or two. Moreover, their alert
            status is improved.</p>
                    <p>The conclusion is that the current disposition of Soviet forces does not tell us much
            about their intentions toward Berlin.</p>

            Republic:</p>

                    <p>The Russians are no longer coming down so hard on the claim that they have the right to
            intervene in the Federal Republic. They base this claim on Articles 53 and 107 of the

            enemy powers.</p>
                    <p>They began pushing this line pretty hard at the beginning of July. The Germans became
            very nervous. To counter this we took the following actions:</p>
                    <p>—On August 31, when Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> warned
              <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> about Rumania, he specifically warned
            that Berlin was a “state interest” of the U.S.<note n="3" xml:id="d293fn3">See <ref target="frus1964-68v17#d90">

                    </p>
                    <p>—On September 17, the U.S., the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, and the French, in
            separate announcements,<note n="4" xml:id="d293fn4">See Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, October 7, 1968, p. 365.</note> said publicly that
            Articles 53 and 107 of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter did not give the
            Soviet Union the right to interfere in the affairs of the Federal Republic. We also said
            that such intervention would bring a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> response.</p>
                    <p>—On September 20, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> repeated this

                    </p>
                    <p>—On October 2, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> made the point
            again in his speech at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.<note n="6" xml:id="d293fn6">For text, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>,

              <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> did not assert Soviet intervention rights in the

            they seem to have backed off this line.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">The most serious threat lies in Communist moves to put pressure on
              Berlin by challenging Federal Republic rights and activities in the city. They could
              do this by:</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>—Putting more restrictions on the movement of people and goods between the Federal
            Republic and West Berlin. Last spring they got away with new visa and passport
            restrictions and travel taxes. They may well try to step up this kind of pressure—again
            without challenging Allied rights in the city.</p>
                    <p>—Intensifying their propaganda charges that Federal Republic meetings and other
            activities in Berlin are provocative acts. This could weaken Berlin morale and threaten
            the viability of the city.</p>
                    <p>The Russians have been building up this kind of propaganda campaign. On September 20
            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> we were concerned about the menacing Soviet tone on Berlin. He
            made it clear that any move against Berlin would be very dangerous and that we cannot
            accept pressures against Berlin or against Berlin contacts with the Federal
            Republic.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> took no notes at this meeting. We cannot
            be sure that the full weight of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>'s
            warning was brought home to the Kremlin.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, in his speech to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, repeated the Soviet position that the Federal Republic had
            no rights in Berlin—but, with velvet glove, issued a warning that any “aggravation of
            tensions” would be Bonn's fault:</p>
                    <p>“The Federal Republic of Germany has ceaselessly laid claims on West Berlin, which has
            a special status of an independent political entity. Our answer is clear: West Berlin
            has never belonged, nor does it belong or will it ever belong to the Federal Republic of
            Germany. If sometimes an aggravation of tensions may occur here, the responsibility for
            this lies squarely with the West German Government.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">A crisis could be associated with some important meetings the Federal
              Republic has scheduled in Berlin the end of October and early November. These
              are:</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>—October 27 to November 2: meetings in Berlin of about twenty committees of the
            Bundestag.</p>
                    <p>—November 3 to November 7: the National Party Congress of the Christian Democratic
            Union.</p>
                    <p>These are high visibility meetings. If the East Germans—with Russian support—increase
            travel restrictions and the Russians intensify their propaganda campaign against Berlin
            so as to interfere with these meetings, the impact on the city and throughout the
            Federal Republic could be great. We could have another Berlin crisis on our hands.</p>
                    <p>This would be a good time, therefore, to try to negotiate quickly an Allied Declaration
            on Berlin along the lines of the memo we sent you on September 17 (attached).<note n="8" xml:id="d293fn8">Not printed. (<persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> Library,

            The Declaration would be negotiated with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, the

                    <p>You have previously set this aside as too openly provocative. The question is: do you
            now regard it as appropriate to move forward so as not to leave <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s warning unanswered.</p>
                    <p>A fall-back position would be to agree that all three former Occupying Powers make a
            parallel démarche through diplomatic channels rather than in a public declaration. The
            experts believe this would not be as effective, but better than inaction—which could
            mislead <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> and Moscow.</p>

              requested <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName>'s evaluation of the likely
              impact of a draft text of an Allied declaration on Berlin. (Ibid.)</note> Subj: Allied
            declaration on Berlin.</p>
                    <p>1. In view of Soviet concern over Western reaction to Czechoslovak affair, I think
            there is a good possibility that West Germans can get away with the various governmental
            and party meetings scheduled to be held in Berlin without serious Soviet reaction. If in
            addition to holding these meetings the Allies issue the proposed declaration, the
            chances of strong <pb n="761" xml:id="pg_761" facs="0791"/>Soviet and East German action
            will be greatly enhanced. If declaration is to be made at all I think it would better be
            made in response to Soviet or East German statements in protest to the meetings.</p>
                    <p>2. As for proposed text, the statement that Allies will accept no interference with
            passage of Germans and commerce between Berlin and Federal Republic sounds rather hollow
            in view of fact that <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> has interfered with passage NDP
            members and others. Moreover, this passage speaks of Berlin and not West Berlin and we
            have certainly accepted in fact <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> control of West
            German access to East Berlin. If this paragraph applies only to West Berlin, statement
            that Three Powers' authority in Berlin (not Four Powers') implies that we are similarly
            prepared to accept Soviet decisions in East Berlin. Although we have not been able to do
            anything about Soviet actions there, I wonder if we should weaken our right to protest.
            Finally, I should think proposed declaration would weaken our ability to keep West
            German activities in West Berlin within bounds.</p>
                    <p>3. For these reasons I believe we should not make any declaration unless forced to do
            so by Soviets or East Germans.</p>

            importance of Berlin as a “vital state interest” of <pb n="762" xml:id="pg_762" facs="0792"/>the United States and that we expected everyone to recognize that fact. I
            accepted Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s subsequent message
            as a categorical statement that the Soviets would not move against Berlin. I said it was
            very important that there be no crisis on this matter because it would be a very grave
            matter indeed.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> stated clearly that the Soviet Union
            did not intend to move against Berlin and asked me whether I really thought they were
            planning to do so. I told him I accepted Soviet assurances on this point but did not
            wish to have a conversation with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
            without reiterating what I had said to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then said that
            the Soviet Union objects to the attempts of the Federal Republic of Germany to take over
            Berlin and indicated that they would continue to press on this point. I told him that it
            was important for West Berlin to have full contacts with the outside world and that it
            was perfectly natural for West Berlin to have close relations with the Federal Republic.
            I said I knew of nothing which the Federal Republic is doing in West Berlin which the
            East Germans are not doing to an even greater extent in East Berlin. I reaffirmed the
            tripartite responsibility for West Berlin. When I remonstrated with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> about their démarche to the Dutch about a visit
            of the Dutch Prime Minister into Berlin he said this was because “the West Germans had
            arranged it”. I scoffed at this reason.</p>
                    <p>Although the Russians have given us a flat commitment about moving militarily on West
            Berlin, this sort of commitment is worth only what it is worth and we can take no
            comfort from the continued pressure on West German activities in Berlin.</p>

                    <p>6954. Secto 68. Subj: Secretary's October 8 luncheon with Brandt. Following based on
            uncleared notes <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss> Noforn, and subject to revision.</p>
                    <p>Secretary gave luncheon for <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> Brandt attended
            by Amb <persName corresp="#p_KHK1">Knappstein</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BE5">Egon Bahr</persName>, <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
                        <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss>, and Alex Johnpoll, <gloss target="#t_GER1">GER</gloss>. Highlights of conversation were:</p>
                    <p>1. Sovs, <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and Berlin. Brandt told Secy that his
            speech at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and particularly the references to
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and Berlin had made a deep impression in Germany.
            He said Kiesinger had asked him to pass along the Chancellor's own thanks.</p>
                    <p>The Secy informed Brandt that he had repeated to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> what he had already told <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> about Berlin being a state interest of the US; and had also
            raised with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> the Sov propaganda attacks
            against the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had replied in two parts:</p>
                    <p>A. He stated quite categorically that the Sovs would not move against Berlin;</p>
                    <p>B. The Sovs object to what the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> is doing in
              Berlin.<note n="2" xml:id="d296fn2">See <ref target="#d295">Document 295</ref>.
              Another memorandum of their October 6 conversation is in Department of State,
              Conference Files: Lot 69 D 182, CF 321.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>The Secy had replied to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that what the
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> is doing in Berlin is our responsibility. There
            are no grounds for Sov objections, especially in view of what the East Germans are doing
            in Berlin.</p>
                    <p>The Secy told Brandt that we will simply have to watch the situation in Berlin and see
            how it develops. The President's position on Berlin is clear and firm, and the two major
            Presidential candidates are also people on whom the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
            and Berlin can rely.</p>
                    <p>Brandt thought it would be helpful if progress could be made on an Allied paper that
            would make clear the legitimacy of what the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> has been
            doing in Berlin over the years, but avoiding areas of juridical controversy between the
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and the Allies. Brandt said that there was some
            difficulty with the French over this, but <persName corresp="#p_DM4">Debre</persName>
            had told him the French would go along with an internal paper along these lines (from
            the three Occupying Powers to the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>) that would not be
            passed on to the Sovs. Brandt said that even such a paper would be better than
            nothing.</p>
                    <p>The Secy replied that this is a matter that requires thought. We have said a lot to the
            Sovs in recent weeks about Berlin and the firmness of our <pb n="764" xml:id="pg_764" facs="0794"/>resolve to defend it. Would it be a sign of weakness in Sov eyes if we
            keep making one statement after another about Berlin? This is something we have to give
            some thought to.</p>
                    <p>2. <gloss target="#t_NPD1">NPD</gloss>. The Secy told Brandt that the problem of the
              <gloss target="#t_NPD1">NPD</gloss> in Berlin was not entirely the same as the problem
            that party posed to the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. We have to take account of
            US public opinion and how it reacts to the program of the <gloss target="#t_NPD1">NPD</gloss> and its anti American posture in a city which is occupied by U.S. troops.
            We can do whatever is required to defend Berlin, but we cannot do that to defend the
              <gloss target="#t_NPD1">NPD</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Brandt said that some people in the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> have criticized
            Schuetz for asking the Allies to ban the <gloss target="#t_NPD1">NPD</gloss>; they say
            Schuetz should have waited for the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> to act. Brandt
            thought this was nonsense. Schuetz was right to bring the problem before the Allies. The
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> may decide to bring the <gloss target="#t_NPD1">NPD</gloss> to court, but in any event the courts would not hand down a decision
            before the 1969 Federal elections. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> Minister of
            Interior is conducting a study but it will probably not be ready for at least another
            two weeks. In the meantime, the <gloss target="#t_NPD1">NPD</gloss> in Berlin is
            infiltrated with many Communist agents from the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The Secy thought that the Allies would now have no alternative but to act against the
              <gloss target="#t_NPD1">NPD</gloss>, Schuetz having raised the matter. Brandt didn't
            think there would be any objection from the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>3. <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. The Secy reminded Brandt of the discussion at
            last night's dinner<note n="3" xml:id="d296fn3">See <ref target="frus1964-68v13#d332">
                                <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1964–1968, vol. XIII, Document
              332</ref>.</note> concerning an extension of the area of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> interests beyond the strict territorial limits of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries, particularly into the Mediterranean and
              <gloss target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss>. If Sov forces were to move toward the Adriatic
              <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> would be faced with a major problem. These
            questions are not taken as seriously by some of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> partners as they deserve to be. This is so important that consultations
            at high levels and through special channels should be established. The Secy asked Brandt
            whether he thought there was any chance that a European caucus might be established in
              <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. The US would not object if a European caucus
            were formed. The Secy pointed out that there have been occasions when we were ready to
            do what Europe wants, but were confronted by the fact that there is no Europe in that
            sense. Brandt replied that a European caucus based on a broad definition of Europe
            (including the Turks, Greeks, Portuguese, et al) would not work. There might be a chance
            for a narrower European caucus. The <gloss target="#t_WEU1">WEU</gloss> would provide a
            good foundation for this but that would require French cooperation. Brandt said that he
            did not want to see anything happen that would reduce US engagement in Europe. Bahr
            added that creation of an additional grouping in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
            would add to the problems caused by the existing groupings.</p>
                    <pb n="765" xml:id="pg_765" facs="0795"/>
                    <p>The Secy asked, in connection with <persName corresp="#p_SM12">Stewart</persName>'s
            suggestion on extending the duration of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, whether
            Brandt thought there was any chance of French cooperation. Brandt replied that he did
            not exclude such a possibility. He thought that the phrasing of such a suggestion would
            be very important. The language suggested by <persName corresp="#p_SM12">Stewart</persName> was too temporary, being limited to “present circumstances.”
            Brandt said that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and the Italians could accept a
            lengthy extension. On the other hand, other countries, like Denmark, would have
            problems.</p>
                    <p>The Secy pointed out that a decision that involved going to the Senate right now would
            cause some constitutional problems in the US.</p>
                    <p>Brandt asked whether the Greek regime was causing political problems for us. The Secy
            replied that we do have a political problem. Andreas Papandreou was very active. On top
            of that, the Greek regime does a lot of foolish things which create more difficulties.
            For example, they took away Miss Mercuri's citizenship and Mercuri is a popular actress
            here. It is not easy for anyone here to step forward and defend the regime. The Secy
            said that Pipinelis was a man who seemed to have good judgment and commanded a lot of
            respect. As a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> matter we may have to decide to
            increase our military assistance to Greece.</p>
                    <p>Brandt thought that it would be helpful all around if there were a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> agency through which military assistance from one
            member to another could be channeled. It would certainly make things easier for the
              <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>4. Offset. Brandt raised the subject. He said that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> had set up a task force, and had raised the level at which it was being
            handled in the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. He didn't know how close we could
            come to agreement in the next couple of months, but there was no doubt that we will have
            to get away from agreements that only cover a limited period.</p>
                    <p>The Secy pointed out that as a result of the Czech crisis things like the <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> Res had been put in the ice box for the moment.
            Undoubtedly efforts will be made to make them active again later. A satisfactory
            settlement of the offset issue will help us handle this.</p>
                    <p>Brandt said that it would also be helpful if a settlement of the offset problem could
            be worked out in the context of some broader <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
            agreements. It is a matter of optics. It would not present a good picture if the only
            consequence in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> of the Czech crisis were to settle
            this bilateral US–<gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> problem. Brandt also cautioned
            against any expectations that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> would take the
            lead in a military build-up among the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries.
            This would create problems within the Western community.</p>
                    <p>5. <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>-French relations. The Secy referred to <persName corresp="#p_DM4">Debre</persName>'s remarks at last night's dinner on <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> choosing between nuclear weapons and doing nothing at
            all in the military field. As a matter of fact, there is hardly anything that would help
              <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> more than a demonstration of French solidarity
            with <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                    <pb n="766" xml:id="pg_766" facs="0796"/>
                    <p>Brandt said that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> has become disillusioned by
            the French, and this is also true of Chancellor Kiesinger who is quite
            disillusioned.</p>
                    <p>Brandt said that the Germans nevertheless will go on talking with the French about
            friendship between the two nations in order to try to save the new relationship between
            the peoples. The Secy though that it was important to leave the way open for France to
            return at some future time to Europe and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. In reply
            to Brandt's question, the Secy said that our own relations with the French had improved
            in manner but not in substance.</p>
                    <p>6. Spanish bases.<note n="4" xml:id="d296fn4">
                            <hi rend="italic">Documentation on the negotiations is scheduled for publication in
                Foreign Relations</hi>, 1964–1968, volume XII.</note> The Secy reviewed for Brandt
            our negotiations with Spain over the base problem. He told Brandt that even if we had
            gone along with the Spanish financial demands, they would have come right back with a
            request for a bilateral security treaty—something that simply could not have gotten
            through the US Senate. The Secy asked Brandt whether he thought there was any chance
            that the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> partners would let Spain into the
            Alliance. Brandt said no. The Dutch, Norwegians, Danes, and the British would be opposed
            to it. But on the problem of Spanish bases, Brandt suggested to the Secy that he ask
            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> to discuss this with Chancellor
            Kiesinger who is going to Spain on a visit shortly.<note n="5" xml:id="d296fn5">
              Kiesinger visited Spain October 27–30.</note> The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
            might have some economic leverage that could be used, and Kiesinger might be able to
            accomplish something in Madrid.</p>
                    <p>The Secy thought it was an interesting suggestion and said he would be communicating
            with Amb <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> about it shortly.</p>

                    <p>Kiesinger said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName> was a most
            welcome guest. The German people, he said, attached great importance to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and to the United States alliance. They have an
            overwhelming conviction on that subject. He hoped that the nuclear planning meetings had
            been good.</p>
                    <p>We must, he said, jointly study what happened in Czechoslovakia—without nervousness and
            without being hectic. He did not believe that Germany should be looking for a “big
            brother”—nor was it. We Germans, he said, are aware that we must do our part to the
            utmost of our capacity.</p>
                    <p>In view of the existing military balance, notably as regards conventional forces,
            Germany's best protection are the U.S. troops on Germany's own soil. It is they who make
            the aggressor think twice.</p>
                    <p>Kiesinger said he had asked himself many times whether the Russian invasion of
            Czechoslovakia was undertaken solely because of events in Czechoslovakia or whether it
            was but one phase in a much larger scheme. The Soviets, he said, seem to be out-flanking
            us on both of our maritime flanks, using intimidation among other methods.</p>
                    <p>Kiesinger said he had had many talks with eminent men both here and in his travels and
            still he was not sure what their aim really is. He was sure that they were trying to
            weaken <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and that they have had some success.</p>
                    <p>On the whole, he thought the second explanation was the right one—that Czechoslovakia
            is part of a larger scheme. We are thus at a decision point in history and “I say this
            as one who does not favor reviving the cold war and who realizes that the US and the
            Soviet Union must be in touch with each other. Indeed, we must find a way of proceeding
            whereby both things are done: that is, the great powers are in touch with each other and
            are also in close consultation with their allies.”</p>
                    <pb n="768" xml:id="pg_768" facs="0798"/>
                    <p>Kiesinger quoted an unnamed European Prime Minister as having said recently: “If the
            Russians had waited two years, nothing would have been left of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.” Kiesinger realized that there was some weakening in both camps; the
            question was in which situation was the danger greater.</p>
                    <p>We must thus expect serious crises in the future. It is quite likely that the Russians
            will be reckless again. Yet even the use of force cannot eliminate the urge of
            nationalism. He could not help but be impressed by what had happened to Czechoslovakia
            and by the fact that the Western world seems all too willing to neglect necessary
            security measures. “I fear there will be a rude awakening.”</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName> said that he brought regards
            from President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> who wished to convey
            thoughts to Chancellor Kiesinger in two areas; (1) with regard to Czechoslovakia and (2)
            with regard to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>In Washington “we think,” said the Secretary, “that the Soviet incursion into
            Czechoslovakia is exceedingly serious.” It is not merely a question of the intervention
            alone. The manner in which the Soviet Government reached this decision should also give
            us pause. The military performance was very efficient. The planes were well handled in
            bad weather. From a political standpoint, of course, it could hardly have been worse.
            There was no proof whatever of outside aggression against Czechoslovakia. Soviet
            intervention was dangerous, awkward and impulsive politically, while being sophisticated
            militarily. It showed that the hardliners had taken over in the Politburo.</p>
                    <p>We don't know whether it is an isolated action or not. Does it threaten Romania? There
            are ten to fifteen divisions there which could be in preparation for a move into
            Yugoslavia. The Soviet may well feel that, having taken the first step, they might as
            well go ahead.</p>
                    <p>We too are aware of the situation in the Mediterranean. Our Sixth Fleet is there and we
            have strengthened it. The Soviets have progressed with their Navy. They have a
            helicopter carrier, marines and landing craft, and a submarine building program. This is
            not a comforting picture. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName>
            recalled <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s recent statement at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> that “as far as Socialism is concerned the Soviets know no
            national boundaries.” All these events have brought about a complete collapse of the
            hopes of the many persons who thought that a new era was at hand.</p>
                    <p>These events also show the transcendent importance of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. We reaffirm our obligation to it. If an ultimate Armageddon is to be
            prevented, it will be by <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. We recognize, of course,
            that each member is a sovereign power and must make its decisions for itself.</p>
                    <p>In the US Congress, the belief is held that the US has met its obligations to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and that there should be no need to keep forces there
            23 years after the end of World War II. Indeed this belief is growing. Senator <persName corresp="#p_SWS2">Symington</persName> has introduced legislation to cut the number of
            American <pb n="769" xml:id="pg_769" facs="0799"/>troops down to 50,000. Senator
              <persName corresp="#p_RRB1">Russell</persName>, the Chairman of the Armed Serv-ices
            Committee, is critical.</p>
                    <p>The Administration now in power believes these viewpoints to be in error. We maintain
            many troops, in many places.</p>
                    <p>But the pressure in the US to cut our contribution in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> goes on because some of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
            countries are not doing their share. Belgium and Canada are actually talking about
            reducing. The British talk about bringing troops back for service in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> but we see very little coming to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. We, in the Administration, must be able to tell
            Congress of what Europe is doing. There is real pressure from the people. This is our
            problem, said the Secretary, and “I am telling you about it.”</p>
                    <p>More must also be done in the balance of payments field. We have a $700 million
            deficit. The conferences on this subject at the lower levels are dragging badly. The
            problem will be there no matter who is in power.</p>
                    <p>We understand that our enlightened self-interest is involved in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. The deterrent to the Soviet Union today is that an
            invasion against Germany would be an invasion against the US. The Soviet Union is not
            persuaded by weakness.</p>
                    <p>Our expenses in the strategic nuclear field are growing.</p>
                    <p>In reply, Kiesinger asked <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName> to present
            his respectful compliments to President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>.
            He said he was quite aware of the situation which Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName> had described and wished to say two things: (1) Germans are
            reconsidering their contribution to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, notably as
            regards troops and (2) when the government passed the last defense budg-et it did so
            with the reservation that “we might have to increase it.” An increase of as much as 15%
            would be serious. In spite of prosperity, public revenues have not risen commensurately.
            Germany, he repeated, was not looking for a “big brother.” The German Defense Ministry
            was preparing a “white paper.” He personally believed Germany should increase, he
            said.</p>
                    <p>The question of offset was an old problem. It involves a very considerable amount of
            money. The government is about to review it. Our representatives, of course, were bound
            by their instructions. An inter-departmental committee has been created to take a new
            look.</p>
                    <p>Please tell the President, he said, that in both areas “we are doing new thinking.” A
            15% increase in the defense budget and a 3.4 billion for offset, make a total of 7
            billion <gloss target="#t_DM1">DM</gloss> out of 81 billion <gloss target="#t_DM1">DM</gloss> in the total budg-et. This means new taxes, as cuts in other parts of the
            budget are not possible. We need the backing of the whole population.</p>
                    <p>DeGaulle had said on his last visit to Bonn<note n="2" xml:id="d297fn2">September
              27–28.</note> that France has more forces in Germany than the United Kingdom. Will the
            French too ask <pb n="770" xml:id="pg_770" facs="0800"/>Germany for offset payments?
            Seven to eight hundred million Deutsche <persName corresp="#p_MLH1">Marks</persName> for
            the French added to amounts for other countries could amount to 8 or 9 billion <gloss target="#t_DM1">DM</gloss>s. He said he wished to expose the whole problem. “I want,”
            he said, “to meet United States interest and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. We
            will try.”</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName> said that yesterday at the
            meeting British Defense Minister Healey had said that the big deterrent to Soviet
            aggression was our tactical nuclear weapons. <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName> said it is not the tactical nuclear weapon; it is actually the
            presence of 300,000 soldiers. He had told Healey he was rendering great disservice to
              <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> by saying this. Should this idea ever get back
            to Congress there would be trouble. It is an invitation to disaster and it shows the
            difference of concepts on this problem.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName> said in conclusion that he could
            not suggest what the Germans should do. He said they must decide for themselves and do
            what is most important for their country.</p>
                    <p>Kiesinger said he saw the problem just as <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName> did but he was also aware that the German farmers “want
            billions.”</p>

              (Ibid.) Telegram 18302 from Bonn, October 19, recommended that the United States
              associate itself with the British letter. (Ibid.) Telegram 2519 from Berlin, October

              October 14, the Department of State authorized the Embassy to tell British officials

                        <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> in tripartite letters delivered last

                    </p>
                    <p>I do, however, have a problem with the proposed procedure for specifically associating
            the US with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> letter. As you know, the US is well
            out in front on the question of Berlin. We have recently made our position clear to the
            Soviets in the strongest possible terms through communications with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>. We have also visibly demonstrated our concern over Berlin
            through the appearances and statements in Berlin of yourself, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName> and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CWJ5">Cohen</persName>. Another specific démarche by us without any apparent reason would
            seem to me to fall clearly in the category of over-reaction on the part of the US.</p>
                    <p>The situation of the British and the French, who have not taken the same forceful steps
            as we have, is of course somewhat different. At the same time a letter limited to just
            the two and omitting the US would certainly raise questions in the minds of the Soviets
            and the East Germans.</p>
                    <p>I wonder whether we could not handle the matter in this way: Let the British send the
            letter to <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> as a purely unilateral
            document setting forth the points which Jackling would have raised orally with <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> if the scheduled meeting between the two had
            taken place; but amend the text of the letter slightly to show that the views set forth
            therein are in line with the tripartite views expressed to <persName corresp="#p_APA1">Abrasimov</persName> in the Nov. 8, 1967 letter. This would have the effect of
            showing that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> position is simply an elaboration of
            established tripartite policy, without the need for specifically associating the US and
            France with the sending of the letter.</p>
                    <p>I suggest that this might be accomplished by inserting the following sentence
            immediately after the first sentence of the 4th paragraph of the Jackling letter: “The
            same views were expressed by the Ambassadors of France and the US.” These two sentences
            would then read, “In this connection I should like to remind you that my predecessor
            wrote to you a year ago to put on the record my Government's views that the Federal
            Government has a legitimate concern for the welfare and viability of Berlin. The same
            views were expressed by the Ambassadors of France and the US.” The rest of the letter
            would then continue as presently drafted.</p>

                    <p>1. Acting Secretary called in <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> November
            13 to make following points re Berlin:</p>
                    <p>(A) <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has become aware of number of rumors to effect
            that action might be taken in near future that would add to difficulties surrounding
            German travel between <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and West Berlin.</p>
                    <p>(B) There was no need to repeat in detail what Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> had already told Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> and FonSec <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> in many
            conversations regarding importance we attach to West Berlin and the maintenance of that
            city's viability.</p>
                    <p>(C) While we did not know whether there was substance to rumors or not, it should be
            understood that any actions in this direction could not help but be taken seriously by
              <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> and affect progress on solutions to problems of
            interest to both <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> noted that foregoing comments were
            based on rumors. Nevertheless, he wished to repeat that Soviet Government was not going
            to be initiator of actions against Berlin. He also wished to make clear, however, that
            if <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> continued its provocations re West Berlin that
            the Soviet Government would reserve the right to take its own measures. He said points

                    <p>5773. Secto 9. Following is summary of Secretary's hour and a half bilateral with
              <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Willy Brandt</persName> November 13. Summary is
            uncleared, subject to revision. Talk covered the following areas:</p>
                    <p>1. German request on possible <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> harassment of Berlin
            access</p>

                    <p>1. German request on possible <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> harassment of Berlin
            access—The Secretary mentioned that Chancellor Kiesinger had spoken to Ambassador
              <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>,<note n="2" xml:id="d300fn2">
                            <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> reported this conversation in telegram

            British and French in Bonn, concerning the possiblity of a US warning to the Soviets
            against East German actions on access to Berlin. The Secretary said it would be helpful
            in the future if in such cases we could get the raw materials of such reports to make
            some evaluation of what was happening and whether the Soviets or the East Germans were
            behind it. We maintain a 24-hour watch on subjects like this and if we had German raw
            materials, we could feed them in for use with our own. The Secretary said we would in
            any case be seeing the Soviets on this subject in Washington on November 13.<note n="3" xml:id="d300fn3">See <ref target="#d299">Document 299</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>2. Interzonal trade and Berlin—The Secretary asked Brandt about the current situation
            of interzonal trade. Brandt replied interzonal meetings were continuing on a regular
            basis of once a week meetings alternately in East and West Berlin. The other side was
            not interested in an increase of trade, although he did note that some East German trade
            experts were interested in increase.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he was concerned about Berlin despite assurances Soviets have given
            on this subject. He was uneasy about the situation in Eastern Europe and of course
            Berlin is a vital point.</p>
                    <p>Brandt said in addition to over-all problems of Eastern Europe, he worried about the
            internal situation in Berlin. The economy was not bad, <pb n="774" xml:id="pg_774" facs="0804"/>but as years go by without upturn in outlook for city, we might reach
            point where worsening psychological situation resulted in real trouble. The <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> meeting was a case in point. This was not a decisive
            question in itself but had represented a German effort to bring in new activities not
            related to status. If the decision is negative, it will add to fears that Berlin is not
            the place to have even non-political meetings.</p>
                    <p>Brandt said the question of whether Bundesversammlung should meet in Berlin should be
            seen in same light. The French are not enthusiastic. The British have today advised the
            Germans against the meeting in Berlin. Perhaps none of these meetings are vital for
            Berlin, but the West has nothing to put against these elements to counteract the
            negative trend.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said we had thought it a good idea if the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> meeting could take place in Berlin. He has talked to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> along these lines. But apparently when matters
            got down to the point of decision, even some <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
            Allies are begging off and the prospects are not too good.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said advice on the Bundesversammlung was more a matter for his successor
            than for himself. In response to his inquiry, Brandt indicated there had been three
            previous meetings of the Bundesversammlung in Berlin and that the <gloss target="#t_NPD1">NPD</gloss> had not participated in these meetings although Von
            Thadden and his colleagues had been present as representatives of the Deutsche
            Reichspartei.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that since the last three meetings of the Bundesversammlung were
            held in Berlin, <pb n="775" xml:id="pg_775" facs="0805"/>not to have the next one there
            could create a problem. Brandt said Bundestag President Gerstenmaier had told him he
            intends to convene the Bundesversammlung in Berlin, but had not decided on a date, which
            will be some time between January and March. Gerstenmaier told Brandt the British had
            sent an Embassy officer to make same representation to him as it had to <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss>. Gerstenmaier had replied to him that if Allies are
            against the meeting, he would prefer to have a joint position from them rather than
            their individual nation views.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he gathered French attitudes on Berlin had been especially
            restrictive lately. Brandt said that the French had been somewhat more cooperative in
            the last 10 days or so. But this did not go very far. He had made a long list of things
            which had been blocked up to date in the Bonn Group, sometimes as much as a year,
            because of French uncooperativeness.</p>
                    <p>3. Current French attitudes—Brandt asked Secretary for his view of reports of general
            shifts in French attitudes. The Secretary said he heard these reports from other
            sources, but not the French.Their bearing has improved, but there is no sign of a change
            of substance or policy. Our problem with the French is the same as it was 10 years ago:
            whether or not to have a love affair with France at the expense of the rest of Europe.
            Had Eisenhower accepted <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>'s Directoire
            proposals in 1958 or <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> in 1961, we could
            have had a lovely relationship with the French, but what of the rest of Europe. The
            Secretary said some reports claim US disagreement with the French over nuclear
            questions. But we never have had any indication from <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
              Gaulle</persName>, the French Prime Minister, or from any other official speaking for
            the French Government of French interest in questions of nuclear cooperation between
            France and the United States.</p>
                    <p>Brandt said that pursuant to a suggestion by the Secretary the Germans had made efforts
            after Czechoslovakia to renew the Franco-German study group on military questions.
            Senior German military officers reported that their French colleagues had views quite
            similar to theirs on questions of European defense, but this had little political
            fallout. The Secretary said that we had found French officials more cooperative in some
            small things. It must be assumed in cases like French participation in the recent naval
            maneuvers in the Mediterranean that they take place with the knowledge and consent of
              <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>. If there is a little quiet
            improvement, we should let it develop.</p>
                    <p>4. Defense—Brandt said that the Germans would give specifics of their decisions in the
              <gloss target="#t_DPC1">DPC</gloss> meeting November 14. An increase of 740 million
              <gloss target="#t_DM1">DM</gloss> had already been approved for the 1969 budget prior
            to Czechoslovakia. But in a Cabinet meeting earlier the same morning the Germans had
            decided on steps which would bring a total increase between 2.3 and 2.5 billion <gloss target="#t_DM1">DM</gloss> for defense in the medium term financial plan. Most of the
            decisions involved qualitative improvements rather than increasing manpower, although
            decline in latter would be halted. The Cabinet had also explicitly endorsed the
            necessity to find a satisfactory offset solution: Brandt asked whether it would be
            helpful for the United States to have a statement on balance of payments in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> communiqué. The Secretary replied it would be helpful
            to have such a sentence included. Czechoslovakia had muffled the attack within the
            Senate on US troops in Europe. But Senator <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> and his colleagues would return to the attack. Two points are
            involved. One is what the Europeans are doing for their own defense. The German record
            here is good. The second problem is the balance of payments. If we were able to deal
            with these two problems, we could hold back this withdrawal viewpoint, which is linked
            with isolationism.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary noted that the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> motivated by purely
            military consideration had revised its ideas as to the desirability of rotation of the
            two withdrawn brigades of the 24th Division. The Secretary said he was not referring to
            the exercises of the brigades in Germany, which should take place at least once a year,
            but military experts believe that if the brigades should rotate their station each 6
            months as now agreed they would lose <pb n="776" xml:id="pg_776" facs="0806"/>a good
            deal of valuable training time in each move as they were readied to move from the US to
            Germany and return. The question was whether we could not leave one brigade on station
            in Germany and have the others join on exercises but not to rotate them. The Secretary
            said he raised this issue to maintain good faith because rotation had been a part of the
            trilateral agreement on this subject which had been worked out between Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> and the Chancellor. He asked Brandt to think it
            over. He noted that <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> had discussed it
            with de Maziere. Brandt replied he would discuss the matter with Schroeder.</p>
                    <p>5. European special trade arrangements—The Secretary said difficulties were building up
            on the question of proposals for a European special trade arrangement which could “blow
            us out of the water” as regards a liberal US trade policy. Brandt said that US had given
            the German <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> a rather strong memorandum on this
            subject Nov 11.<note n="4" xml:id="d300fn4">Not found.</note> He said <persName corresp="#p_DM4">Debre</persName> had made the point in the last meeting in Brussels
            that the trade arrangements were not a substitute for British membership in the Common
            Market but facilitated and prepared the way for membership. Secretary pointed out that
            the German paper established situation from which we would draw no political advantages
            and for which we have to pay high price in trade. In effect we would be paying a high
            price, “but would not get the horse.” In the scheme proposed, the participants would
            agree to pay high prices on agricultural products in return for concessions on
            industrial goods. The United States would lose on both counts. The Secretary said that
            the démarche which Brandt had received on this subject had been personally reviewed and
            signed by him. He described the dangers of a possible revival of protectionist
            sentiments in the US.</p>
                    <p>Brandt said French had been moving toward a more constructive position on trade
            arrangements and technical cooperation. If we take approach however that it has to be
            all or nothing, then it would be nothing, and situation would get worse. His purpose was
            to get the British to the table with the French and Germans and to see what practical
            progress could be made. Secretary replied this was all right in theory as long as it was
            not a table conspiring against the US.</p>
                    <p>6. Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia—The Secretary said that when the Soviets decided to
            invade Czechoslovakia, they knew that they would clearly incur very high costs,
            including the hatred of the Czech people, division in the Communist world and a very
            strained relationship with the West. The men who made this decision despite the cost
            must have had something serious in their minds. Was it fear for maintaining their
            position or reversion to a more primitive Stalinism? We did <pb n="777" xml:id="pg_777" facs="0807"/>not know the answer but must watch this situation very carefully. We must
            not permit Soviet leaders to feel they can move forward to take up elements of slack in
            the international situation. Secretary said that was why he would be hesitant to advise
            that the Bundesversammlung should not take place in Berlin. If this were to happen, the
            Soviets might draw the wrong conclusion.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said Soviet system was not stable in long-range terms. Communist and
            Eastern European countries cannot survive peaceful coexistence without change. Communist
            scientists were given some freedom and inevitably asked for more. Soviets gone to
            extreme lengths to emphasize their desire to continue normal relations with us after
            Czechoslovak intervention. Yesterday <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> had
            made the same points with <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>. Brandt
            commented that the Soviets had not moved very far in their relations with the Germans,
            but polemic attacks had decreased and they appeared ready to discuss specific issues
            like renunciation of force agreement. The Secretary noted the contradiction between
            Soviet action in Czechoslovakia and their line on business as usual. Shortly before the
            invasion they had taken a rather forthcoming position on missile talks. Their next move
            had been to inform us of the intervention. The Secretary said we had nothing going on
            with the Soviets behind the scenes except that we were keeping them informed of Vietnam
            talks in Paris; Czechoslovakia had cut off discussion of other topics.</p>
                    <p>8. Continuity of US policy—The Secretary said he had participated in a long talk on
            foreign policy between the President and Mr. Nixon.<note n="5" xml:id="d300fn5">
                            <persName>Richard Nixon</persName> was elected President on November 5.</note> The
            talk pointed up the fact that there was no major issue between the two administrations
            about <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> policy or German-American relations. There
            would be continuity in US policy.</p>
                    <p>In reply to a question from Secretary, Brandt said he thought German elections would
            take place Oct 12, 1969. In reply to a question from the Secretary Brandt said that
            April 11–12, 1969 would be acceptable date for him for <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> twentieth anniversary.</p>

            handed me by First Deputy Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_KVV2">Kuznetsov</persName> this afternoon.<note n="2" xml:id="d301fn2">In telegram 6932

                <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> disputed that holding the

              continue its “vicious propaganda” against the Federal Republic, when the Federal
              Republic was obviously trying to improve relations with the Soviet Union. After
              reiterating Soviet opposition to the Bundesversammlung, <persName corresp="#p_KVV2">Kuznetsov</persName> explained that “the Soviets were not closing the door to
              seeking a realistic basis for settlement of the German problem in the interest of
              securing peace in Europe. There was an opportunity now for the US and the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> to show that they wanted to stop using West Berlin for

                    <p>3. The West German authorities have announced their intention to hold a Federal
            assembly for the election of the new President of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> in West Berlin in March 1969. According to communications from Bonn there
            will also participate in the elections representatives of the pro-Hitlerite, neo-Nazi
            National Democratic Party, which is more and more expanding its activity in the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> directed against the interests of peace and security in
            Europe. In spite of warnings and in defiance of good sense certain circles of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> are in this manner embarking on a path of deliberate
            aggravation of the situation around (vokrug) West Berlin.</p>
                    <p>4. The new provocation, which is being prepared by the Government of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, can only have the effect of seriously burdening
            international relations. It is evident that in Bonn they are calculating precisely on
            this and assume that tension will favor their revanchist efforts to consolidate their
            hold on West Berlin.</p>
                    <p>5. There is not one Allied document which would permit the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> to turn that city into a source of hostile activity against the Soviet
            Union and the governments friendly to it or to misuse communications, including <pb n="779" xml:id="pg_779" facs="0809"/>air communications, for the transport there of
            the participants in unlawful political demonstrations and for the fusion of West Berlin
            with the Federal Republic. The Soviet Union at one time concluded with the Western
            Powers agreements concerning the presence of Occupation authorities in West Berlin, but
            it did not give its consent to any annexation of this city to the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>6. In Moscow, naturally, efforts to sanctify the provocative activity of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> with respect to West Berlin by means of decisions of the
            organs of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> military bloc have not gone
            unnoticed. But it ought to be clear to everyone that neither <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nor anyone else can give to the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
            rights in West Berlin which have not belonged to it, do not belong to it, and will not
            belong to it.</p>
                    <p>7. The Soviet Union and the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> have displayed a
            maximum of restraint in the face of the challenge made by the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> through its actions in West Berlin in October and November of this year.
            Possibly this was wrongly understood. If developments will proceed as they are now
            proceeding, and if the militaristic and neo-Nazi forces of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> continue to display in the center of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> their revanchist claims and their open disrespect for the interests and
            legal rights of the socialist countries, they must assume all responsibility for the
            consequences of this and will not have grounds for complaints concerning appropriate
            retaliatory measures to suppress such illegal activity.</p>
                    <p>8. It is desirable that nothing should be left unsaid (nedomolvok) between our
            governments in questions concerning West Berlin.</p>
                    <p>9. The Soviet Union has no claims on that city. The Government of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> has also more than once stated that it does not intend to
            encroach on West Berlin or to interfere in its internal affairs.</p>
                    <p>10. The three Western Powers in their turn, have repeatedly stated that West Berlin
            does not belong to the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and cannot be administered by
            its authorities. The Soviet Union proceeds precisely from this fact, since a different
            situation would exclude the possibility of mutual understanding between us on this
            question.</p>
                    <p>11. The entire complex of these questions has been repeatedly discussed between the
            Governments of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> and each side has underlined its desire to avoid an aggravation of the
            situation in and around West Berlin. Such an approach also corresponds to the broader
            interest of our states and to the interests of peace in Europe. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> must not be permitted to ignore these interests and to
            use West Berlin to create international complications whenever it chooses.</p>
                    <p>12. It would be best if the Government of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
            through sober reflection were to abandon efforts to remake European political geography
            in its own way since such a course promises no good, first of all, for West Germany
            itself. The Soviet Union would welcome such a change in the policy of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> as well as efforts by the <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> directed toward <pb n="780" xml:id="pg_780" facs="0810"/>restraining the
            West German authorities from the provocative and dangerous steps which are being planned
            by them.</p>
                    <p>13. However, if events require that the Soviet Union take certain steps in connection
            with the intrigues of revanchist and neo-Nazi circles of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> in West Berlin, it will of course not hesitate to do so.</p>
                    <p>14. The Soviet Government assumes that these considerations will be examined with full
            attention by the Government of the <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> and with a
            recognition of the obligations and responsibilities of our countries in international
            affairs and in the maintenance of peace. <hi rend="italic">End text</hi>.</p>
