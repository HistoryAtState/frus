                <head>About the Series</head>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents
                    the official documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and
                    significant diplomatic activity of the U.S. Government. The Historian of the
                    Department of State is charged with the responsibility for the preparation of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The staff of the Office of
                    the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, under the direction of the General
                    Editor of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series, plans,
                    researches, compiles, and edits the volumes in the series. Secretary of State
                    Frank B. Kellogg first promulgated official regulations codifying specific
                    standards for the selection and editing of documents for the series on March 26,
                    1925. These regulations, with minor modifications, guided the series through
                    1991.</p>
                <p>Public Law 102–138, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, established a new
                    statutory charter for the preparation of the series which was signed by
                    President George H.W. Bush on October 28, 1991. Section 198 of P.L. 102-138
                    added a new Title IV to the Department of State’s Basic Authorities Act of 1956
                    (22 U.S.C. 4351, et seq.).</p>
                <p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be
                    a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major U.S. foreign policy decisions
                    and significant U.S. diplomatic activity. The volumes of the series should
                    include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation of major
                    foreign policy decisions and actions of the U.S. Government. The statute also
                    confirms the editing principles established by Secretary Kellogg: the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series is guided by the principles of
                    historical objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered or deletions
                    made without indicating in the published text that a deletion has been made; the
                    published record should omit no facts that were of major importance in reaching
                    a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the purposes of concealing a
                    defect in policy. The statute also requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series be published not more than 30 years after the events
                    recorded. The editors are convinced that this volume meets all regulatory,
                    statutory, and scholarly standards of selection and editing.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Sources for the <hi rend="roman">Foreign Relations</hi>
                    Series</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute requires that the published
                    record in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series include all
                    records needed to provide comprehensive documentation of major U.S. foreign
                    policy decisions and significant U.S. diplomatic activity. It further requires
                    that government agencies, departments, and other entities of the U.S. Government
                        en<pb n="IV" facs="0005" xml:id="pg_IV"/>gaged in foreign policy
                    formulation, execution, or support cooperate with the Department of State
                    historians by providing full and complete access to records pertinent to foreign
                    policy decisions and actions and by providing copies of selected records. Most
                    of the sources consulted in the preparation of this volume have been
                    declassified and are available for review at the National Archives and Records
                    Administration (Archives II), in College Park, Maryland.</p>
                <p>The editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series have complete
                    access to all the retired records and papers of the Department of State: the
                    central files of the Department; the special decentralized files (“lot files”)
                    of the Department at the bureau, office, and division levels; the files of the
                    Department’s Executive Secretariat, which contain the records of international
                    conferences and high-level official visits, correspondence with foreign leaders
                    by the President and Secretary of State, and the memoranda of conversations
                    between the President and the Secretary of State and foreign officials; and the
                    files of overseas diplomatic posts. All of the Department’s central files for
                    1977-1981 are available in electronic or microfilm formats at Archives II, and
                    may be accessed using the Access to Archival Databases (AAD) tool. Almost all of
                    the Department’s decentralized office files covering this period, which the
                    National Archives deems worthy of permanent retention, have been transferred to
                    or are in the process of being transferred from the Department’s custody to
                    Archives II.</p>
                <p>Research for <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes is undertaken
                    through special access to restricted documents at the Jimmy Carter Presidential
                    Library and other agencies. While all the material printed in this volume has
                    been declassified, some of it is extracted from still-classified documents. The
                    staff of the Carter Library is processing and declassifying many of the
                    documents used in this volume, but they may not be available in their entirety
                    at the time of publication. Presidential papers maintained and preserved at the
                    Carter Library include some of the most significant foreign affairs related
                    documentation from White House offices, the Department of State, and other
                    federal agencies including the National Security Council, the Central
                    Intelligence Agency, the Department of Defense, and the Joint Chiefs of
                    Staff.</p>
                <p>Some of the research for volumes in this subseries was done in Carter Library
                    record collections scanned for the Remote Archive Capture (RAC) project. This
                    project, which is administered by the National Archives and Records
                    Administration’s Office of Presidential Libraries, was designed to coordinate
                    the declassification of still-classified records held in various Presidential
                    libraries. As a result of the way in which records were scanned for the RAC, the
                    editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series were not always
                    able to determine whether attachments to a given document were in fact attached
                    to the paper copy of the docu<pb n="V" facs="0006" xml:id="pg_V"/>ment in the
                    Carter Library file. In such cases, some editors of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Foreign Relations</hi> series have indicated this ambiguity by stating that
                    the attachments were “Not found attached.”</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Editorial Methodology</p>
                <p>The documents are presented chronologically according to time in Washington, DC.
                    Memoranda of conversation are placed according to the time and date of the
                    conversation, rather than the date the memorandum was drafted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by
                    guidance from the General Editor and the Chief of the Declassification and
                    Publishing Division. The original document is reproduced as exactly as possible,
                    including marginalia or other notations, which are described in the footnotes.
                    Texts are transcribed and printed according to accepted conventions for the
                    publication of historical documents within the limitations of modern typography.
                    A heading has been supplied by the editors for each document included in the
                    volume. Spelling, capitalization, and punctuation are retained as found in the
                    original text, except that obvious typographical errors are silently corrected.
                    Other mistakes and omissions in the documents are corrected by bracketed
                    insertions: a correction is set in italic type; an addition in roman type. Words
                    or phrases underlined in the original document are printed in italics.
                    Abbreviations and contractions are preserved as found in the original text, and
                    a list of abbreviations and terms is included in the front matter of each
                    volume. In telegrams, the telegram number (including special designators such as
                    Secto) is printed at the start of the text of the telegram.</p>
                <p>Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate omitted text that deals with an
                    unrelated subject (in roman type) or that remains classified after
                    declassification review (in italic type). The amount and, where possible, the
                    nature of the material not declassified has been noted by indicating the number
                    of lines or pages of text that were omitted. Entire documents withheld after
                    declassification review have been accounted for and are listed in their
                    chronological place with headings, source notes, and the number of pages not
                    declassified.</p>
                <p>All brackets that appear in the original document are so identified in the
                    footnotes. All ellipses are in the original documents.</p>
                <p>The first footnote to each document indicates the sources of the document and its
                    original classification, distribution, and drafting information. This note also
                    provides the background of important documents and policies and indicates
                    whether the President or his major policy advisers read the document.</p>
                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not
                    printed in the volume, indicate the location of additional <pb n="VI"
                        facs="0007" xml:id="pg_VI"/>documentary sources, provide references to
                    important related documents printed in other volumes, describe key events, and
                    provide summaries of and citations to public statements that supplement and
                    elucidate the printed documents. Information derived from memoirs and other
                    first-hand accounts has been used when appropriate to supplement or explicate
                    the official record.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic
                    Documentation</p>
                <p>The Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation, established under
                    the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute, monitors the overall
                    compilation and editorial process of the series and advises on all aspects of
                    the preparation of the series and declassification of records. The Advisory
                    Committee does not necessarily review the contents of individual volumes in the
                    series, but it makes recommendations on issues that come to its attention and
                    reviews volumes as it deems necessary to fulfill its advisory and statutory
                    obligations.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Declassification Review</p>
                <p>The Office of Information Programs and Services, Bureau of Administration,
                    conducted the declassification review for the Department of State of the
                    documents published in this volume. The review was conducted in accordance with
                    the standards set forth in Executive Order 13526 on Classified National Security
                    Information and applicable laws.</p>
                <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information,
                    subject only to the current requirements of national security as embodied in law
                    and regulation. Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the
                    appropriate geographic and functional bureaus in the Department of State, other
                    concerned agencies of the U.S. Government, and the appropriate foreign
                    governments regarding specific documents of those governments. The
                    declassification review of this volume, which began in 2014 and was completed in
                    2018, resulted in the decision to withhold 3 documents in full, excise a
                    paragraph or more in 4 documents, and make minor excisions of less than a
                    paragraph in 23 documents.</p>
                <p>The Office of the Historian is confident, on the basis of the research conducted
                    in preparing this volume and as a result of the declassification review process
                    described above, that the documentation and editorial notes presented here
                    provide a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of the <persName
                        corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> administration’s policy toward
                    Africa.</p>

                <p>This volume is part of a subseries of volumes of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series that documents the most important issues in the

                        Carter</persName>. This section on Sub-Saharan Africa is one of three parts
                    of Volume XVII on Africa. The other two parts address the administration’s
                    policy toward the Horn of Africa and toward North Africa. This compilation on
                    Sub-Saharan Africa traces the administration’s handling of events in East,
                    Central, and West Africa. For readers interested in U.S. policy toward southern
                    Africa, the transition toward majority rule, the South African occupation of
                    Namibia, and the role of Cuba in Angola, see <ref target="frus1977-80v16"><hi

                <p>The focus of this volume is on the <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>
                    administration’s approach to events in Sub-Saharan Africa in particular. First,
                    the volume addresses the debates within the administration on how to approach
                    the continent as a whole. Memoranda and interagency studies demonstrate that the
                    administration aimed to rethink the U.S. approach toward Africa, but
                    acknowledged its predecessor’s fear of Cuban and Soviet influence in the
                    continent. The volume also includes sections on regions in Sub-Saharan Africa.
                    The chapter on West Africa provides documents that concentrate on the role of
                    Nigeria as a powerful player in African economies and politics, the U.S.
                    response to a Liberian coup that overthrew a long-time U.S. ally, and U.S.
                    relations with the smaller countries in West Africa. The chapter on Central
                    Africa largely focuses on U.S. relations with Zaire, in particular the handling
                    of the two Shaba crises and the recovery of the Zairian economy, as well as on
                    aid and investment in Sudan and parts of the Sahel. Finally, the chapter on East
                    Africa traces the U.S. response to the threatening behavior of <persName
                        corresp="#p_AID_1">Idi Amin</persName> in Uganda and the subsequent
                    Tanzanian invasion to overthrow him. At the same time, the United States
                    strengthened its relations with Tanzania and Kenya, in order to further U.S.
                    goals in southern Africa.</p>
                <p>The <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> administration’s most
                    important goal in its Africa policy was the transition to majority rule in
                    southern Africa. Further documentation is printed in <ref

                    decisions and actions, the editors have identified key documents regarding major
                    covert actions and intelligence activities. The following note will provide
                    readers with some organizational context on how covert actions and special
                    intelligence operations in support of U.S. foreign policy were planned and
                    approved within the U.S. Government. It describes, on the basis of declassified
                    documents, the changing and developing procedures during the Truman, Eisenhower,
                    Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, and Carter Presidencies.</p>

                <p>The Truman administration’s concern over Soviet “psychological warfare” prompted
                    the new National Security Council to authorize, in <gloss target="#t_NSC_1"

                    operations. <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> 4–A made the Director of
                    Central Intelligence responsible for psychological warfare, establishing at the
                    same time the principle that covert action was an exclusively Executive Branch
                    function. The Central Intelligence Agency (<gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>)
                    certainly was a natural choice but it was assigned this function at least in
                    part because the Agency controlled unvouchered funds, by which operations could
                    be funded with minimal risk of exposure in Washington.<note n="1"

                <p>The <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>’s early use of its new covert action
                    mandate dissatisfied officials at the Departments of State and Defense. The
                    Department of State, believing this role too important to be left to the <gloss

                <p>
                    <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> 10/2 directed the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1"
                        >CIA</gloss> to conduct “covert” rather than merely “psychological”
                    operations, defining them as all activities “which are conducted or sponsored by
                    this Government against hostile foreign states or groups or in support of
                    friendly foreign states or groups but which are so planned and executed that any

                <p>During the Korean conflict the OPC grew quickly. Wartime commitments and other
                    missions soon made covert action the most expensive and bureaucratically

                    in early 1951 asked the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> for enhanced policy

                    initiatives. In April 1951 President Truman created the Psychological Strategy
                    Board (PSB) under the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> to coordinate
                    government-wide psychological warfare strategy. NSC 10/5, issued in October

                    Security Council directives, the responsibility of the Director of Central
                    Intelligence for the conduct of covert operations was further clarified.
                    President Eisenhower approved <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> 5412 on March

                <p>After the Bay of Pigs failure in April 1961, General Maxwell Taylor reviewed U.S.
                    paramilitary capabilities at President Kennedy’s request and submitted a report
                    in June that recommended strengthening high-level direction of covert
                    operations. As a result of the Taylor Report, the Special Group, chaired by the

                    Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Lyman Lemnitzer, assumed greater

                <p>From November 1961 to October 1962 a Special Group (Augmented), whose membership
                    was the same as the Special Group plus Attorney General Robert Kennedy and

                    judging the impact of U.S. initiatives on events. In October 1969 the new Nixon

                    the Committee had approved and automatic termination of any operation not

                <p>The 40 Committee met regularly early in the Nixon administration, but over time
                    the number of formal meetings declined and business came to be conducted via

                    annual status reports to the 40 Committee for each approved operation. According
                    to the 1976 Church Committee Final Report, the 40 Committee considered only

                    working group chaired by Aaron at the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>. This
                    group was referred to by several names during the late Carter administration,
                    including the Deputy’s (or Deputies) group, the Aaron group, the interagency
                    group, the Black Chamber, and the Black Room.</p>
                <p>The Carter administration made use of a new category of presidential findings for
                    “world-wide” or “general” (or “generic”) covert operations. This continued a
                    practice initiated late in the Ford administration in response to the
                    Hughes-Ryan requirement for presidential findings. The worldwide category
                    covered lower-risk operations that were directed at broad policy goals
                    implemented on a worldwide basis as assets allowed. These operations utilized
                    existing assets as well as existing liaison contacts with foreign intelligence
                    or security services, and in some cases also consisted of routine training or
                    procurement undertaken to assist foreign intelligence partners or other agencies
                    of the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>. A new type of document—known as
                    “Perspectives”—provided more specific tasking guidance for these general,
                    worldwide covert activities. Perspectives detailed the themes to be stressed in
                    furtherance of a particular policy goal. Riskier operations required their own
                    presidential finding or Memorandum of Notification (see below). Perspectives
                    were drafted by the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> and cleared by the
                    Department of State, so that the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> could vet
                    the operational feasibility and risks of the program while State could assess
                    the diplomatic risks and verify that the program was consistent with overall
                    foreign policy goals. At least initially, Perspectives did not require further
                    coordination with the OAG, <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss>, or the
                    President. Once an agreed-upon Perspectives document was finalized by <gloss
                        target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> and the Department of State, it was
                    transmitted to the field, and posts were required to make periodic reports on
                    any achievements under the Perspectives guidelines. Beginning in 1978, actions
                    in this worldwide category were authorized by the President as specific
                    line-item additions to a previously existing “world-wide” finding, though
                    Perspectives were still used to provide additional details.</p>
                <p>Another new document used during the Carter administration was the “Memorandum of
                    Notification” (MON). MONs were initially<pb n="XXXI" facs="0032"
                        xml:id="pg_XXXI"/> used to introduce higher-risk, significantly higher-cost,
                    or more geographically-specific operations under a previously-approved worldwide
                    or general objective outlined in a Perspectives document. Like Perspectives,
                    MON’s had to be coordinated between the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> and
                    the Department of State, but they also required broader interagency coordination
                    within the <gloss target="#t_SAWG_1">SAWG</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_SCC_1"
                        >SCC</gloss>. MON’s subsequently came to be used for significant changes to
                    any type of finding, not just worldwide ones. Entirely new covert actions
                    continued to require new presidential findings. The Hughes-Ryan amendment
                    stipulated that Congress be notified of new findings “in a timely fashion,” but
                    did not specify how much time that meant. During the Carter administration, the
                        <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> typically notified Congress of new
                    covert initiatives within 48 hours, including those outlined in Perspectives or
                    MONs.</p>
                <p>In October 1980, the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1981—also
                    known as the Intelligence Oversight Act of 1980—scaled back the Hughes-Ryan
                    amendment’s provisions for congressional oversight of covert action. While the
                    requirement to notify Congress about presidential findings remained in place,
                    the new Act limited the committees of Congress that had to be briefed to the two
                    intelligence committees, and also explicitly clarified that this requirement to
                    keep the committees “fully and currently informed” did not constitute a
                    requirement for congressional approval of covert action or other intelligence
                    activities. Moreover, the new Act stipulated that if the President determined it
                    was “essential to limit prior notice to meet extraordinary circumstances
                    affecting vital interests of the United States,” the President could limit prior
                    notice to the chairmen and ranking minority members of the two intelligence
                    committees, the Speaker and minority leader of the House, and the majority and
                    minority leaders of the Senate—a group that came to be known as the “Gang of
                    Eight.” If prior notice of a covert action was withheld, the President was
                    required to inform the two intelligence committees “in a timely fashion” and
                    provide a statement of the reasons for not giving prior notice.<note n="20"

                            11–10–76 on Soviet Military Policy in the Third World, dated October 21,
                            1976. See <ref target="frus1969-76ve06#d55">Document 55 in <hi
                                    rend="italic">Foreign Relations,</hi> 1969–1976, volume E–6,
                                Documents on Africa, 1973–1976</ref>. In the estimate, the IC noted
                            that the amount of Soviet aid to Africa in absolute terms was small, but
                            due to the size and equipment of the military forces of Sub-Saharan
                            Africa, even limited amounts of Soviet military aid could have a large
                            impact. Drawing on this assessment, on February 18, 1977, President
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Jimmy Carter</persName> signed

                            on Africa, which argued for ways in which to keep the Soviets
                            off-balance in the continent. See <ref target="frus1977-80v04"><hi

                            well and is economically strong enough to influence trade and market
                            development in the area. They need military assistance in view of the
                            uncertainties to their north. (I opposed arm sales to Kenya while in
                            Congress because I saw their influence being damaged by possible
                            instability following Kenyatta’s death. Kenyatta remains strong, and the
                            Kenyan civil servants and top political leadership seem strong enough to
                            carry on without him, though they may have a rather turbulent

                            There is a feeling that Kissinger led them into this, promising U.S.
                            support which has not materialized.</p>
                        <p>In spite of these difficulties the British must be kept in the driver’s
                            seat on Rhodesia, but they need a lot of help. Ivor Richard seems their
                            most able negotiator but Anthony Duff should be brought in to assist. An

                            support, especially in relation to South Africa.</p>

                        <p>1. Africa is the latest, the last, and will be, perhaps, the worst area
                            of instability and conflict resulting from the end of the European
                            colonial empires, a process which began immediately after World War II
                            and which has seen the withdrawal of the British, French, Dutch,
                            Belgians, and Portuguese from the Eastern Mediterranean (Greece and
                            Cyprus), the Middle East, South Asia, North Africa, and Southeast
                            Asia.</p>
                        <p>2. These withdrawals involved conflicts between the colonial power and
                            indigenous nationalist groups, between contending indigenous groups, and
                            between outside powers and forces attempting to fill the vacuum.
                            Although British, French, and Belgian colonial rule in Africa
                            substantially came to an end in the 1960s, the full consequences of that
                            termination are only now being felt, in part, because of the
                            comparatively low level of economic and political development of Africa
                            at the time of independence and in part because of the continued active
                            role of the European powers, particularly France, in many parts of the
                            Continent.</p>
                        <p>3. The end of the European presence creates vacuums which can be filled
                            in one or more of three ways:</p>
                        <p>(a) by indigenous nationalist forces (as in India under Nehru or Egypt
                            under Nasser);</p>
                        <p>(b) by U.S. influence (Greece in 1947, Iran in 1954);</p>
                        <p>(c) by Soviet influence or communist forces (Indochina; Indonesia in the
                            1960s).</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">II.</hi> The Bases of Soviet
                            Influence</p>
                        <p>1. Compared to the other ex-colonial regions, Africa presents many more
                            opportunities for Soviet influence because:</p>
                        <pb n="6" facs="0038" xml:id="pg_6"/>
                        <p>a. Traditional, pre-colonial political and social systems were at
                            comparatively low levels of development and do not provide a heritage
                            and experience which can be effectively drawn in the post-colonial
                            era.</p>
                        <p>b. The European colonial impact on Africa was, in most cases, relatively
                            short and consequently did not leave a residue of political institutions
                            which could (as in India) provide an initial framework for post-colonial
                            political stability.</p>
                        <p>c. At the time of independence, most African countries were at very low
                            levels of economic, social, and educational development.</p>
                        <p>d. As a result of these factors, indigenous political groups have been
                            comparatively weak in leadership organization, cohesion, and
                            effectiveness.</p>
                        <p>e. The presence of white settler regimes in Rhodesia and South Africa
                            creates a natural target for the Soviets and inhibitions for U.S.
                            policy.</p>
                        <p>f. Unlike the situation in other ex-colonial regions, the intense era of
                            post-colonial conflict and instability in Africa comes at a time of
                            Soviet-American strategic parity and after the development by the
                            Soviets of their capabilities to project overseas either their own or
                            satellite (Cuban) military forces.</p>
                        <p>g. This era of conflict and instability in Africa also comes at a time,
                            post-Watergate and post-Vietnam, when the confidence of the U.S. public
                            in governmental leadership and institutions, although rising, is still
                            low and when leaders of public opinion remain gun-shy about anything
                            resembling another Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>2. As a result of these and other factors, the Soviets have been able to
                            establish positions of influence in a number of countries scattered
                            about Africa, most notably Guinea, Libya, Somalia, Congo-Brazzaville,
                            Mozambique, Angola. The indications of their desire to extend their
                            influence more broadly are clear.</p>
                        <p>3. The influence of other outside powers in Africa, including the
                            residual influence of the colonial powers (Britain and France) and the
                            more recent influence of the Chinese, is declining.</p>
                        <p>4. The United States has not had major interests in Africa and has, at
                            present, few and rather questionable sources of support there: e.g.,
                            Kenya, Morocco, Liberia, Zaire, and not much else.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">III.</hi> Consequences of Soviet
                            Influence</p>
                        <p>1. All these considerations mean that Africa is probably the worst region
                            in the world for a confrontation between the United States and the
                            Soviet Union or Soviet-backed forces.</p>
                        <p>2. In the absence of major changes in African political development or
                            major U.S. economic, political, and military commitments to Africa, <pb
                                n="7" facs="0039" xml:id="pg_7"/>Soviet influence in Africa is thus
                            likely to grow significantly during the next decade.</p>
                        <p>3. This growth of Soviet influence may well result in a draining away of
                            Soviet resources with little permanent gain, with African governments
                            which have been dependent on the Soviets eventually detaching themselves
                            from the Soviet embrace in the manner of Egypt or Indonesia. On the
                            other hand, some African governments may become (because of their
                            economic, military, and political weakness) so dependent on Soviet
                            support that they are (on the Cuban model) unable or unwilling to break
                            that tie.</p>
                        <p>4. The growth of Soviet influence in Africa will be perceived in Africa
                            and in other countries as a victory for the Soviets and as a setback for
                            the United States. Depending upon the extent and nature of the growth of
                            that influence, it could produce a backlash in the U.S., particularly
                            among black groups, over the “loss” of Africa (analogous to the
                            1949–1954 backlash about the “loss” of China).</p>

                            Policy</p>
                        <p>Given all these factors, the U.S. should not become deeply involved in a
                            major effort to stop head-on the expansion of Soviet influence in
                            Africa. Instead, the U.S. should pursue a damage-limiting strategy
                            designed:</p>
                        <p>(1) to minimize the opportunities for Soviet influence in the Continent
                            by mediating—in so far as this is possible—peaceful solutions to
                            problems;</p>
                        <p>(2) to attempt to increase the risks to the Soviets by warning of the
                            seriousness with which we would view any additional direct Soviet
                            military involvement on the Continent and by linking Soviet expansion
                            there to other issues;</p>
                        <p>(3) to minimize the consequences of Soviet expansion by avoiding
                            identification with probable losers in intra-African confrontations. If
                            any situation should arise where U.S. commitments require U.S. support
                            for one party in an intra-African military conflict, our support should
                            be overwhelming, dramatic, decisive, and brief—leaving no doubt from the
                            start that the U.S. has committed its full power and “face” to the side
                            of its ally. We should not go into an African military conflict
                            incrementally as we did in Vietnam—and we should recognize that
                            bureaucratic and political reasons make it very difficult to cut-off the
                            process of American involvement once it begins. That process of slow
                            involvement usually produces too-little too-late to help our ally and
                            yet also results, at some point, a major commitment of American

                            but it clearly will not remain that unless it can make progress toward a
                            peaceful resolution of its racial problem. The second most powerful
                            country in sub-Saharan Africa is Nigeria. Nigeria has the people (in
                            numbers and education), oil, a tradition of reasonably effective
                            political authority, and a lingering British residue, which could make
                            it the Brazil of Africa in the coming decade. The factors that favor the
                            Soviets in Africa are generally weaker in Nigeria than elsewhere in the
                            continent. It should become a principal target of U.S. effort to develop

                            position in other regions surrounding Africa and thereby, in a broad
                            geo-political sense, contain Soviet influence there. U.S. relations with
                            Brazil, for instance, should not be allowed to deteriorate. The U.S.
                            position in the Middle East should be further developed, which would
                            clearly limit what the Soviets could do in Africa. And with Soviet
                            attention on Africa, the U.S. should attempt to improve significantly
                            its relations with India.</p>

                        <p>On July 1, 1977, Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_VC_1"
                                >Vance</persName> gave a speech before the annual convention of the

                                target="#t_NAACP_1">NAACP</gloss>) in St. Louis, Missouri, in which
                            he defined the <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>
                            administration’s Africa policy. On Cold War competition, he emphasized
                            that “a negative reactive American policy that seeks only to oppose
                            Soviet or Cuban involvement in Africa would be both dangerous and
                            futile.” He advocated encouraging African nationalism, using
                            developmental aid to build a “prosperous and strong Africa that is at
                            peace with itself,” and ensuring that U.S. Africa policy reflected
                            national values and a respect for human rights. In more specific terms,
                                <persName corresp="#p_VC_1">Vance</persName> explained that “this
                            Administration has decided to pursue actively solutions to all three
                            southern African problems—Rhodesia, Namibia, and the situation within
                            South Africa itself.” The full text of the speech is in the Department

                        <p>I recently had lunch with <persName corresp="#p_BGT_1">Goler
                                Butcher</persName> to talk about a closer coordination of <gloss
                                target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> policy in Africa with general US
                            policy objectives. We left it that I would get back to her with a
                                memo.<note n="2" xml:id="d5fn2">Not found.</note></p>
                        <p>Let me sketch a few thoughts. To the extent that the President has
                            rightly put substantial restraints on using American military forces and
                            providing military assistance to African governments, economic,
                            diplomatic, and ideological strategies rise in importance. Our <gloss
                                target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> program (with other economic
                            strategies) will emerge as a quite important instrument of American
                            foreign policy. This implies that the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1"
                                >NSC</gloss> must at least have a reasonably clear picture of the
                            objectives of <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> programs, the
                            response by host countries to those programs, <gloss target="#t_AID_1"
                                >AID</gloss> projections of future country needs, and the capacity
                            and desirability of the United States to meet them. This does <hi
                                rend="italic">not</hi> imply, however, that <gloss target="#t_AID_1"
                                >AID</gloss> should become a naked instrument of US policy
                            manipulation vis-a-vis any African government.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">General Aid Objectives in Africa</p>
                        <p>Our general aid objectives would include the following:</p>
                        <p>1. Maintain increasing aid levels to participate in meeting the needs of
                            African countries most important to us.</p>
                        <p>2. Maintain an effective <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> program in
                            the Sahel.</p>
                        <p>3. Maintain sufficient aid flexibility vis-a-vis Congress and
                            congressional appropriations to serve the most important policy
                            functions which we call upon the <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>
                            program to perform.</p>
                        <p>4. Maintain sufficient aid flexibility for our North-South
                            objectives—whether bilateral or multilateral—in Africa.</p>
                        <p>5. In line with our policy of dialog with African states, formulate
                                <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> objectives by even closer
                            consultation with host country governments, but be more open and honest
                            with them about defining US <pb n="10" facs="0042" xml:id="pg_10"
                            />interests, and operate more forthrightly with respect to <gloss
                                target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> programs on a benefit-sanctions basis
                            if American interests are not being met.</p>
                        <p>6. Formulate American objectives and American interests with a greater
                            appreciation of African realities and perceptions than heretofore.</p>
                        <p>These thoughts refer primarily to our bilateral <gloss target="#t_AID_1"
                                >AID</gloss> policy vis-a-vis each African government, and not as
                            much to our general North-South strategy, in which, of course, Africa
                            plays a large role.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"><gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> and African
                            Policy</p>
                        <p>In making such an inquiry, as we explore the utility of <gloss
                                target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> programs as an instrument of general
                            US African policy, we must be aware of the <hi rend="italic">limits</hi>
                            of that concept. These would seem to lie at the point where we might ask
                                <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> to take action which is <hi
                                rend="italic">not</hi> consistent with the <hi rend="italic"
                                >development</hi> of the country or countries concerned. <hi
                                rend="italic">That notion constitutes a limit because development of
                                African countries in se is a quite important interest of the United
                                States</hi>. I may go further and say that we are rapidly moving
                            beyond definitions of development based on purely economic statistical
                            criteria and incorporating into our policy perceptions and definitions
                            of development—especially in Africa—which have value concepts inherent
                            in them.</p>
                        <p>In Southern Africa, for example, there is a strong strain of thought
                            which says there is no development without victory of the liberation
                            movement. That is, development cannot exist in the context of racism and
                            white minority rule. Similarly, under our human rights policy, we are
                            beginning to say that there can be no development without a minimum
                            level of human rights in the host country, however we may define it. In
                            any case, it seems clear that “development” in each African state has
                            inherent in it certain value premises which <gloss target="#t_AID_1"
                                >AID</gloss> must increasingly respond to, and which we at <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> should increasingly be aware of.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">We should not, therefore, call upon <gloss
                                    target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> to take any action or formulate
                                any objective contrary to the development of a particular African
                                country</hi>. But, <hi rend="italic">within</hi> the notion of
                            development, there is room for dialog between the host government and
                            the US Government about the implementation of <hi rend="italic"
                                >some</hi> shared value-premises. This dialog is subject to the
                            overriding truth that the development of each African country must, in
                            the medium-to-long run, be accomplished by Africans.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Next Steps</p>
                        <p>Having proposed the above, it would seem that we need to know certain
                            things. <hi rend="italic">First</hi>, the general policy objectives of

                            with a recently expressed wish by the President to have individual
                            country objectives submitted by each Ambassador.<note n="3"

                            is curtailed by the necessities of budgetary planning, congressional

                            Nevertheless, the effort would seem worth making because of the

                        <p>You might already know most or all of this. Or, most or all of it might

                        <p>1. There are two and possibly only two principles on which Africa is
                            united. These are: A. Principle of territorial integrity, B.
                            Anti-colonialism and majority rule.</p>
                        <p>2. There are many other principles and attitudes in which there is
                            considerable African interest even majority concern but only on these
                            two is there unanimity.</p>
                        <p>3. The Russians have managed to be on the right side of these two issues
                            while we have been hesitant or equivocal in the light of other
                            interests.</p>
                        <p>4. The result is that we get considerable influence as a result of our
                            policies toward development, health, food and agriculture, investment
                            and technical assistance but jeopardize it all because of our
                            equivocation on the essential African issues.</p>

                            influence by not realizing the unanimity on the territorial integrity
                            issue while the Soviets moved quickly to support the federal governments
                            of Nigeria and Ethiopia.</p>
                        <p>6. In Southern Africa we have been slow to identify with the majority
                            aspirations of former Portuguese colonies and the liberation movements
                            of Southern Africa.</p>
                        <p>7. On every other issue we have an outstanding and credible record and
                            the Soviets are miserable.</p>
                        <p>8. So far, the <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>
                            administration has done very well on the colonialism-majority rule
                            issue. We were slow—myself included—in realizing the importance of the
                            territorial integrity issue. It really strains my values to support a
                            repressive regime as the one in Ethiopia, but Africa has seen repressive
                            regimes come and go. Repression and violence threaten only a few states
                            but every African nation has border <pb n="13" facs="0045"
                                xml:id="pg_13"/>problems and none can afford to support border
                            changes without threatening themselves.</p>
                        <p>9. Our insensitivity to African priorities has created a vacuum in which
                            Russian and Cuban forces gain an advantage. I know we deferred to the

                            aggressive act in the Horn, but in the absence of military options (and
                            I think the post Vietnam period has seriously limited all military
                            options unless the US herself is directly threatened), it is imperative
                            that we develop a creative, aggressive and sensitive diplomatic approach
                            to all questions.</p>
                        <p>10. This we have done very well in the Middle East, Panama, <gloss
                                target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> and up to now in Southern
                            Africa.</p>
                        <p>11. I am afraid that our present situation in Rhodesia has the potential
                            for jeopardizing the progress we have made. A wait and see attitude in
                            Rhodesia now is just like our attitude of ten months ago in the Horn. It
                            creates a vacuum which almost certainly will be filled by Soviet-Cuban
                            forces, and once again they will have the solid support of Africa.</p>
                        <p>12. Alternatively, action on our part has risks, but we would be
                            entertaining those risks with the support of African leadership and
                            could with a concerted effort win South African support as well.</p>
                        <p>13. Our enemy in Africa is chaos. We can negotiate with and ultimately
                            influence any educated African leadership. Their power depends on their
                            ability to meet the needs of their people once the fighting stops and
                            the Russians have never assisted much in that direction. Western
                            technology, capital, management and markets are the basis of the kind of
                            peaceful competition the President spelled out in his Notre Dame
                                speech.<note n="5" xml:id="d6fn5">A reference to <persName

                        <p>14. It will take considerable effort to explain the complexities of this
                            situation to our public and the Congress, but it is important that we
                            try. We must make it clear that the situation cannot be resolved in the
                            simplistic terms of Communist and terrorists versus moderates. I hope
                            you won’t mind my taking on this challenge.</p>
                        <p>15. I know it is difficult with such a crowded agenda to focus on
                            Rhodesia, but I hope that we can keep our policy moving forward. A
                            breakthrough in Africa could also be a very positive contribution to <pb

                                meeting with Sadat on the subject of African problems and his fear
                                of Soviet-instigated problems on the continent. Sadat asserted that
                                “the Soviet surrogate threat through Libya and Ethiopia to
                                Sub-Saharan Africa is very real.” In particular, he was worried that
                                “we will see trouble in the Sudan from both the East and the West.”
                                (National Archives, RG 59, Central Foreign Policy File,
                                D780112–0455)</note> It seems clear now that the long East-West
                            “truce” in Africa came to an end with the disappearance of the
                            Portuguese empire in 1975 and that the Soviet Union, whether prompted by
                            new opportunities or other motives, is ready to pick up again a policy
                            thread which it dropped after its misadventure in the Congo 15 years
                            ago. It seems clear also that the US has not yet found a coherent

                        <p>In my view a paper on this subject would examine relevant Soviet policy
                            but would take as given that the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                            will be ready to send arms, advisers, and Cubans to places where these
                            could help it build up its local influence. Local conflict, as in the
                            Horn, provides one kind of Soviet opportunity. Liberation conflicts in
                            Rhodesia and South Africa offer another sort, perhaps even more
                            promising because even more difficult for the West to deal with. There
                            are also regimes which will want Soviet arms and perhaps Soviet/Cuban
                            forces to help keep themselves in power vis-a-vis domestic or foreign
                            enemies or both. It will <pb n="15" facs="0047" xml:id="pg_15"/>be a
                            long time before the conditions disappear from Africa which provide
                            these opportunities to Soviet policy.</p>
                        <p>In one way or another, therefore, the Soviet Union and the United States
                            will be competing in Africa. There are several possible policy responses
                            to these various kinds of challenges which we should look at
                            systematically. Each has potential benefits and limits.</p>
                        <p>1) In our current policy, we try to remove the occasions for Soviet
                            intervention. A basic policy, of course, is to promote political
                            stability by means of economic and social progress. Our diplomatic
                            efforts toward majority rule in Rhodesia and Namibia and our support for
                            a negotiated resolution of the problems of the Horn are also examples of
                            this approach. In southern Africa, we are committed to a process of
                            change without associating ourselves with particular nationalist groups
                            seeking power in the successor regimes.</p>
                        <p>2) We support <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> and other efforts to
                            remove the causes of territorial conflicts among African states and to
                            limit their scope if they do occur. Although the Soviets may be cool to
                            the argument that African problems should be left to the Africans, this
                            position is consistent with the African nations’ own commitment to
                            mediate disputes and prevent major power intervention wherever possible.
                            Real and consistent US support for this principle should have increasing
                            effect with the African nations.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> track record to
                            date has not been impressive and it is not clear how effective Western
                            efforts to support and strengthen the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1"
                                >OAU</gloss> in mediating African disputes will be. But the effort
                            should be pursued.</p>
                        <p>3) In determining future policy, we might explore the possibility,
                            despite obvious inhibitions, of seeking closer economic and political
                            ties with countries where Soviet influence is strong, such as Angola,
                            Mozambique, and Ethiopia, rather than maintaining cool relations and
                            waiting for the Soviets to be thrown out because of their own blunders
                            or inadequacies. This could reduce Soviet influence and at the same time
                            indicate United States support for African non-alignment.</p>
                        <p>4) We could actively seek international agreements, including with the
                            Soviets, on arms restraint in Africa, or in specific sub-regions of the
                            continent, which would limit sudden buildups of military forces by one
                            country or another. Since both Soviet and United States military
                            assistance is concentrated in a few countries, usually rivals in the
                            same region, such restraint agreements would be necessary to avoid
                            escalating military assistance competition. We should urge the African
                            states to adopt regional and perhaps continent-wide agreements on
                            consumer restraint in arms transfers.</p>
                        <p>The diversity of African countries, their own suspicion of outside
                            efforts to restrain military sales in the area, and the probable Soviet
                                <pb n="16" facs="0048" xml:id="pg_16"/>reluctance to commit
                            themselves in advance to a policy of military non-supply for some
                            prospective “revolutionary” regime suggest serious practical
                            difficulties in following through on such a course. These difficulties
                            are compounded by the Soviet Union’s relative inability to compete with
                            the West in Africa in any area but arms transfers.</p>
                        <p>5) We could use a variety of diplomatic tools to seek to reduce Soviet
                            and Cuban intervention in Africa or increase the political costs of such
                            intervention. We could seek greater African and Latin American
                            disapproval of their intervention. We could link our economic and
                            diplomatic relations with the Soviets and Cubans to their actions in
                            Africa, and seek agreement by other countries to do the same. By making
                            even minor linkages we could demonstrate in a concrete way that Soviet
                            activities in Africa do have an impact on our relations—and perhaps
                            convince the Soviet Union to exercise sufficient restraint that <gloss
                                target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> itself will not be jeopardized. We
                            need to express publicly our disapproval of Soviet intervention in
                            Africa, but not build up the stakes in those cases when we are unable
                            militarily or otherwise to counter their activities.</p>
                        <p>Thus far, Latin American countries have shown little interest in Cuban
                            and Soviet activities in Africa. African concerns have been muted so far
                            by the Soviets’ choice of the “right” causes: southern African
                            liberation and territorial integrity. Cuba has already made clear that
                            its relations with us are lower priority than its activities in Africa.
                            Our own leverage with the Soviet Union is fundamentally related to the
                            importance we and they attach to detente and <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                                >SALT</gloss> and the degree to which we are willing to balance
                            these against US and Soviet interests in Africa, and the impact
                            Soviet/Cuban “success” has on the image of the US elsewhere, including
                            within the US itself, and on our ability to pursue otherwise mutually
                            advantageous relations with the Soviet Union. Our leverage on
                            Soviet/Cuban policy in Africa might grow over the years (e.g., if
                            economic relations become more important). In any case, we must always
                            make clear to the Soviets that what they do in Africa cannot but have a
                            significant impact on the atmosphere within which we conduct our overall
                            relations and on our ability to pursue relations in other spheres,
                            including arms control.</p>
                        <p>6) We could demonstrate support for African countries by providing (or
                            assisting others to provide) arms to countries threatened by build-ups
                            of Soviet military assistance and foreign troops on their borders—e.g.,
                            Sudan, Kenya, Somalia, Zaire, etc.</p>
                        <p>There are, of course, risks and difficulties in this. We would have
                            problems in providing arms to certain repressive regimes or to countries
                            which may have stimulated their neighbors’ involvement with the Soviets
                            by their own territorial claims or intervention in their neighbors’
                            internal affairs. We should look carefully before providing arms to sure
                                <pb n="17" facs="0049" xml:id="pg_17"/>losers, though there may be
                            occasions on which there will be political benefits in appearing to be
                            responsive even in such difficult cases. We should consider the costs of
                            an open-ended competitive buildup of rival countries and of expectations
                            and commitments we may not want to fulfill later. We also should avoid
                            seeming to dispense arms prodigally, at odds with our overall policy of
                            restraint. At the same time relatively small transfers could have a
                            significant effect in some cases, at least to the extent of reassuring
                            governments that look to us for help or signs of US interest. Such
                            transfers would have only a relatively small impact on our overall
                            transfer figures. Larger transfers, which <hi rend="italic">would</hi>
                            affect these figures more seriously, might, of course, be justified by a
                            given situation.</p>
                        <p>7) We should be cautious in committing ourselves to causes and countries
                            which are “wrong” in terms of their ability to command broad African
                            support: countries striving to expand their territory, to stir up unrest
                            in other countries, or groups and minorities seeking to divide or break
                            up African countries. We should not allow ourselves to automatically
                            support one side in an African dispute because the Soviets are
                            supporting the other. We have provided economic assistance to liberation
                            movements and the southern African Front Line States, even though they
                            are receiving military support from the Soviet Union. Should the
                            conflict in the region escalate, we may face more difficult decisions on
                            whether to also provide military assistance to vulnerable African states
                            such as Botswana.</p>
                        <p>There are, however, real limits to our ability to provide support for a
                            country or movement which is also receiving Soviet aid. It would be
                            particularly difficult to support Marxists, or groups determined to
                            resolve problems militarily and hostile to negotiations.</p>
                        <p>8) We could encourage the formation of, or provide weapons to, local
                            defensive alliances where the governments concerned are interested and
                            the potential longer-term risks seem manageable. We should, however,
                            carefully avoid building up paper <hi rend="italic">cordons
                                sanitaires</hi> which would tend to draw us into the difficulties of
                            our protegés beyond a point we might wish and would create illusions of
                            solidarity and strength which could not stand up to serious challenge.
                            Such a policy could aggravate the problem of regional military
                            assistance competition between the United States and the Soviet Union.
                            It could also serve to harden divisions on a continent where
                            reconciliation among rivals and shifts in regional “alliances” are
                            frequent.</p>
                        <p>9) We could more actively encourage other countries, including our
                            European allies, which are concerned about Soviet activities in Africa
                            to respond themselves, rather than relying on United States involvement.
                            This might include outside troops (e.g., Moroccans in Zaire, French in
                            Chad) as well as supply of weapons. This might make <pb n="18"
                                facs="0050" xml:id="pg_18"/>it possible for the defense needs of an
                            African state to be met, while minimizing major power confrontation by
                            avoiding United States involvement. It would, however, require the US to
                            provide more arms to such outside assisting states and to agree to their
                            use in third countries.</p>
                        <p>10) There is the option of direct United States military action—either
                            against Cuba or in an African country. After Vietnam, this is highly
                            unlikely.</p>
                        <p>11) We could limit involvement in military conflicts and give major
                            emphasis to our long-term advantages in relations with Africa: trade,
                            aid, and investment to solve the basic economic problems that persist
                            after military disputes have been resolved. The <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> has little else than weapons which,
                            important as they are in certain situations, are a questionable basis
                            for long-term influence, as the Soviets have learned more than once. We
                            could use this more to our advantage in our relations with the African
                            states and in seeking Soviet restraint—pointing out to the Africans the
                            lack of Soviet effort in the economic field and our belief that
                            constructive economic assistance is needed far more in Africa than
                            destructive military assistance, challenging the Soviets to cooperate or
                            compete with us more in the economic sphere.</p>
                        <p>All of these policies may not keep the Soviets in the near-term from
                            intervening in African affairs or allow us to defeat their interventions
                            promptly in every instance. This consideration leads us to what might be
                            the last topic in the paper: the problem of defining US interests in
                            Africa in such a way that we will be able to obtain Congressional and
                            public support for actions we might want to take but, at the same time,
                            will provide us the option of avoiding being forced into actions which
                            may be futile or dangerous. I believe this problem should be an
                            important part of any general discussion of our policy in Africa. It is
                            clear there will continue to be Soviet actions in Africa which will be
                            hard to deal with, either locally or by use of global leverage. Some of
                            our allies and Middle Eastern friends would wish us to defeat every
                            Soviet “challenge” at once. We will have to give thought to how we can
                            make clear to them that we will carefully adapt our response to the
                            specifics of each Soviet move and that patience is not to be confused
                            with weakness.</p>

                        <p>The following <gloss target="#t_NFAC_1">NFAC</gloss> analysis (dated 3
                            March 1978) points to various vulnerabilities of the Cuban government to
                            a better informed domestic public opinion on the issues of Cuba’s
                            involvement in Africa.<note n="4" xml:id="d8fn4">See <ref

                                    Document 18</ref>.</note> A better informed Cuban public could
                            represent a source of pressure on <persName corresp="#p_CF_1"
                                >Castro</persName> to modify those involvements.</p>
                        <p>The political, military, economic, and social costs to Cuba of its
                            expanding role in Africa are still well within manageable limits and are
                            not a significant constraint on Cuban policymakers. Only heavy Cuban
                            casualties would be likely to present the <persName corresp="#p_CF_1"
                                >Castro</persName> regime with difficult political problems.</p>
                        <p>Reaction to the country’s extensive involvement in Africa is mixed among
                            the Cuban people. Pro-regime activists openly support the African
                            commitments, but many people are convinced that the country’s current
                            austerity is caused by the involvement; in fact, it stems largely from
                            low world sugar prices. No organized opposition exists in Cuba, however,
                            and without planning, coordination, and leadership, those who oppose
                            Cuba’s role in Africa have little impact on regime leaders. <pb n="20"
                                facs="0052" xml:id="pg_20"/>So far, opposition is limited to
                            grumbling among friends and family of ordinary Cubans sent to do service
                            in Africa.</p>
                        <p>As is his custom during periods of flagging popular support, President
                                <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Fidel Castro</persName> has spent a good
                            deal of time since mid-1977 traveling through the country trying to
                            bolster morale. <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Castro</persName> is keenly
                            aware of—and exploits—the considerable capacity of the Cuban people to
                            endure hardships. His normal reaction is to manufacture both a reason to
                            suffer and a scapegoat to hate. A master of media manipulation, he has
                            little trouble refocusing public anger and generating renewed
                            revolutionary momentum.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Castro</persName> is probably not yet overly
                            concerned about public attitudes. The numerous speeches and heavy media
                            treatment in the last six months are, in effect, pre-emptive moves to
                            head off disaffection. <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Castro</persName>
                            doubtless knows that the current level of discontent is well within
                            tolerable limits and that by careful persuasion he can keep it far short
                            of the point where outright repression might be required.</p>
                        <p>The political and economic costs of Cuban involvement in Africa will
                            probably remain manageable for Havana, at least for the near term. A
                            deepening popular disaffection, stemming from an exaggerated perception
                            of the financial costs, could pose a constraint on Cuban policymakers,
                            however, should the number of casualties the Cubans suffer increase
                            rapidly.</p>

                        <p>This paper addresses the means by which Cuban public opinion and the

                            be adversely affected; they may in turn share their sentiments with
                            friends and family at home. Those at home then may be less quick to
                            support <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Castro</persName>’s adventures and

                                revolution and building his image as third world leader while acting
                                as surrogate for <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> in military
                                and para-military activities. This serves <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                                    >USSR</gloss>’s objective and supplements its own efforts to
                                extend its military capabilities and political influence in Africa.
                                Covert action efforts, in support of U.S. foreign policy, should
                                therefore focus on: exposing Cuban/Soviet motives; mobilizing
                                international criticism of Cuban/Soviet actions; and strengthening
                                resolve of those African states opposed to further Cuban/Soviet
                                intervention in Africa.</p>
                            <p>2. Following provides background on Cuban/Soviet activities and
                                underlying motives and goals:</p>
                            <pb n="23" facs="0055" xml:id="pg_23"/>
                            <p>a. Cuban involvement in Africa goes back to 1960’s when Cuban
                                advisers began training militia forces to support leftist liberation
                                governments/movements in Congo (Brazzaville), Guinea, Zanzibar,
                                Cameroon Republic and Guinea Bissau. At present Cuban personnel are
                                deployed in about ten countries, either in military capacity or as
                                civilian advisers or technicians. Estimated numbers range from as
                                high as 10,000 or more in Angola to only 20–25 in Guinea Bissau as
                                well as in Sierra Leone. Outside of Angola, Cuban personnel are
                                believed present in largest numbers (i.e., several hundred), in
                                Congo (Brazzaville) which was major staging area and rear base for
                                Cubans fighting in Angola. Cubans are also in Tanzania, Equatorial
                                Guinea, Republic of Guinea, Somalia, Zambia and the Spanish
                                Sahara.</p>
                            <p>b. Cuban intervention in Africa, paid for and logistically supported
                                by <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, is ideally suited to
                                    <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Castro</persName>’s goal of becoming
                                major link between communist and third world countries, thus opening
                                way for him to attain significant international attention. Cuban
                                success in Angola has reinforced his views that communist and third
                                world nations have gained advantage over Western powers in this
                                area. He appears determined to capitalize on this success, which
                                could possibly lead to an effort to obtain Soviet backing for Cuban
                                training of liberation groups opposed to white-minority regimes in
                                Southern Africa.</p>
                            <p>c. Soviets demonstrated considerable interest in Africa in early
                                1960’s, in wake of several African nations’ gaining independence.
                                Although they seemed to lose interest from middle 1960’s to 1971,
                                they have since become more active and more selective as to areas in
                                which they operate. In 1971 <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                                began gradually to increase arms shipments to Guinea, Somalia,
                                Tanzania and Uganda, and has since gained access to facilities for
                                military operations in Guinea and Somalia, including expansion of
                                military base in Berbera, Somalia.</p>
                            <p>d. In Angola <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> saw opportunity
                                to develop and expand its influence by exploiting crisis situations.
                                Its long-standing assistance to <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1"
                                    >MPLA</gloss> had remained at moderate levels until date for
                                independence became known, after which assistance escalated sharply
                                and Cuban intervention began in earnest. By arming <gloss
                                    target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> and using Cuban troops to
                                intervene in Angolan conflict, <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                                    >USSR</gloss> has accomplished objectives of attaining influence
                                in Angola and of gaining access to port facilities and airfields on
                                South Atlantic coast of Africa, supplementing facilities it had
                                already acquired on Coasts of Guinea and Somalia. Also, Angola’s
                                strategic location, on borders of both black-ruled and white-ruled
                                countries, gives Soviets opportunity to exert political and military
                                influence throughout wide area.</p>
                            <p>e. By using Cubans to help advance their objectives, Soviets are able
                                to maintain relatively low profile in crisis situations, thereby
                                concealing their intent and eliminating fears of Soviet
                                neo-colonialism on part of <pb n="24" facs="0056" xml:id="pg_24"
                                />Africans. Using Cubans also gives Soviets one of few benefits they
                                can hope to get in return for their huge investment in Cuba, which
                                is heavily mortgaged to <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> for
                                years to come.</p>
                            <p>f. Overall Soviet goals in Africa are to identify with and
                                demonstrate continuing commitment to cause of national liberation
                                and to diminish Chinese influence with liberation movements; to
                                reduce or contain western influence; and to obtain access to other
                                strategically located military facilities.</p>
                            <p>3. In addition to exploiting Cuban/Soviet motives and goals, [<hi
                                    rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] draw on
                                following state-approved guidelines for covert action purposes:</p>
                            <p>a. Emphasize vital need for settlements providing for majority rule
                                in Rhodesia and an acceptable self-determination process for
                                Namibia. Solution of these problems would remove two of most
                                important pretexts Soviets and Cubans have used to justify intrusion
                                into Africa.</p>
                            <p>b. Note inconsistency of those African countries that grant to <gloss
                                    target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> near-exclusive base rights and
                                free access to airports and harbors and yet profess to be
                                non-aligned.</p>
                            <p>c. Support territorial integrity of African states in order to
                                strengthen resolve of moderate countries which oppose Cuban/Soviet
                                incursions, or which fear territorial ambitions of their more
                                radical neighbors.</p>
                            <p>d. Exploit Chinese criticisms of intervention by Cuba and <gloss
                                    target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and their responses to this
                                criticism, including Cuba’s attack on <gloss target="#t_PRC_1"
                                    >PRC</gloss> for its support of “imperialists” and “white racist
                                regimes.” Exploit any statements from Maoist/Peking elements that
                                criticize Soviet/Cuban domination of Angolan Government.</p>
                            <p>e. Question <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Castro</persName>’s right to
                                request foreign aid from Western governments and wisdom of these
                                governments in extending aid, when he is spending fortunes (which
                                could well include aid funds) in deploying troops and equipment in
                                distant foreign wars.</p>
                            <p>f. Encourage consideration about more sober attitudes of governments
                                in Latin America toward Cuban adventures abroad, noting that number
                                of Latin American leaders see that <persName corresp="#p_CF_1"
                                    >Castro</persName> took initiative in Angola. These attitudes of
                                Latin American leaders indicate that Cuba cannot expect to renew its
                                credentials as “revolutionary leader” and at same time retain its
                                recently acquired respectability in Latin America.</p>
                            <p>g. Emphasize that southern Africa is far removed from Soviet and
                                Cuban homelands and well beyond reasonable limits of their
                                traditional security interests. Suggest that their continued
                                activity in this potentially explosive area could undermine what
                                policy of detente has achieved and could severely damage East/West
                                relationships.</p>

                            inducements and sanctions, will be appropriate in countering Soviet and

                        <p>—What are the dominant public and Congressional perceptions of Soviet and
                            Cuban activity in Africa?</p>
                        <p>—What public posture is most effective in terms of dealing with US
                            domestic concerns and with foreign opinion?</p>
                        <p>—What level of legislative restraint are we likely to encounter in our
                            overall programs of coping with Soviet and Cuban involvement?
                            (Constraints on specific actions should be included in the discussion of
                            these actions.)</p>

                        <p>—Care should be taken to differentiate between Soviet and Cuban goals,
                            policies, etc. in the course of the discussion.</p>
                        <p>—Analysis should take place at two levels throughout the study. While due
                            attention should be given to broad strategies (e.g. continent-wide aid
                            programs as a means of offsetting Soviet activities), the prime focus
                            should be on specific situations such as the Horn, Rhodesia and others
                            that turn out to be most acute in the course of analysis. In these
                            specific cases the study should provide a full range of options for
                            furthering US interests.</p>
                        <p>—This study should be as brief and direct as possible, assuming
                            substantial knowledge of the issue on the part of the Policy Review
                            Committee.</p>
                        <p>—The implementation of ongoing policy should not be delayed by this
                            study.</p>
                        <p>—No course of action should be automatically excluded from consideration
                            solely because it will present difficult political problems or <pb

                            evident, they should, of course, be noted.</p>

                        <p>2. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YA_1">Young</persName> met with Cuban
                            Vice President Carlos Rafael Rodriguez May 24 to discuss the Western
                            initiatives on Namibia and inform the Cubans the US hoped that they and
                            the Angolans would cooperate in advancing the Namibian negotiations
                            toward a peaceful <pb n="31" facs="0063" xml:id="pg_31"/>settlement.
                            Rodriguez was accompanied by Cuban <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                            PermRep Raul Roa Kouri and Teofilo Acosta, First Secretary, Cuban
                            Interest Section in Washington. Cooks and Blacken accompanied <persName
                                corresp="#p_YA_1">Young</persName>.</p>
                        <p>3. Rodriguez, after exchanging greetings, remarked that the Cuban
                            Government was confused, upset, and angry over reported statements by
                            United States leaders which had appeared in the press falsely accusing
                            Cuba of certain actions and distorting its intentions in Africa. He then
                            hurriedly added that this was not the purpose of this meeting.</p>
                        <p>4. Rodriguez mentioned that the Cubans were looking forward to a visit by
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YA_1">Young</persName> to Cuba;
                            however, he recognized that the political environment was not right yet.
                            The Cubans would like to improve the environment in which discussions
                            and relations with the United States are conducted. He said he
                            understood that our two countries have different approaches to problems
                            in Africa but there were a number of things in which we had parallel
                            interests. Recently the issues had become confused and the Cubans
                            thought we should work to clarify them.</p>
                        <p>5. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YA_1">Young</persName> commented that
                            the American people’s reaction to Cuba and Cuban policies in Africa was
                            complex, and difficult for foreigners to understand. Rodriguez responded
                            that he was concerned over statements made by United States official
                            spokesmen. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YA_1">Young</persName>
                            explained the adversary relationship existing between the press corps
                            and the Department spokesman tended to result in unbalanced and dramatic
                            press treatment of policy statements. <persName corresp="#p_YA_1"
                                >Young</persName> added that he thought the State Department’s
                            reaction to Cuba and to Cuban activities in Africa had been objective
                            and balanced. Rodriguez nodded agreement.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_YA_1">Young</persName> said that the events in
                            Zaire had been extremely upsetting. He was convinced that military
                            solutions were not possible in Africa. No country’s interest would be
                            served by violence. Any external power with resources could back a
                            dissident group in almost any African country and convert that group
                            into a destabilizing force for the government of that country. He
                            asserted that the United States was not engaged in destabilization in
                            Angola. Rodriguez interrupted saying “but you are preparing to do so”.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YA_1">Young</persName> said this was
                            not the case, but he could see how certain statements could be
                            interpreted in that fashion.</p>
                        <p>7. Rodriguez commented that it was extremely dangerous for all concerned
                            when a nation engaged in military attacks or destabilizing efforts.
                            During the past year the Cubans had perceived that American policy
                            toward Africa, especially as reflected in statements by Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_VC_1">Vance</persName> and Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_YA_1">Young</persName>, was realistic. Policy
                            had been conducted in a quiet and patient manner. But recently there had
                            been a tendency, reflected through the US press, toward exaggeration,
                                spread<pb n="32" facs="0064" xml:id="pg_32"/>ing falsehoods, and the
                            “creating of scandals” concerning Cuban policy and developments in
                            Africa. [Omission in the original] had not been reporting the truth
                            about Cuba. There were no Cuban troops in Eritrea. Yet this is the
                            impression that the press was falsely giving. Cuba is not engaged in
                            anything “dangerous” in Africa.</p>
                        <p>8. In response to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YA_1"
                            >Young</persName>’s comment that it was extremely difficult to tell what
                            was going on in Zaire, Rodriguez agreed, but added that he knew what was
                            not going on. Cuba was not involved in the Shaba invasion or with the
                            invaders. There was a danger in public statements by US officials which,
                            in effect called Fidel a liar.</p>
                        <p>9. Rodriguez talked at length explaining that Cuba’s policies and actions
                            had a moral basis. Rather than lie, <persName corresp="#p_CF_1"
                                >Castro</persName> would not discuss an issue, but when he speaks
                            out he speaks the truth. When a situation is extremely sensitive he will
                            refuse to have an interview rather than get placed in a position where
                            he would have to lie.</p>
                        <p>10. Rodriguez emphatically repeated “we are not involved in Zaire; we
                            have no relations with the Katangans. Two years ago we did provide some
                            training and arms, but there has been no provision of arms or training
                            for the present operation.” He said that the invasion of Shaba created
                            dangers for Angola and for Cuban interests in Africa. The Cubans were
                            convinced that <persName corresp="#p_NAA_1">Neto</persName> had nothing
                            to do with the situation in Shaba. Rodriguez added that he knows the
                            Soviet Union is also worried. They know there are some Soviet arms in
                            the hands of the rebels. Confusion exists concerning their (the Soviets)
                            motivation. Rodriguez repeated “they (Soviets) are seriously
                            worried”.</p>
                        <p>11. The conversation turned back to Namibia. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_YA_1">Young</persName> stated that the hope of the US
                            rested in the emergence of an independent and nationalist Namibia. Even
                            if it were not controlled by <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss>,
                            such a Namibia should give Angola a sense of security.</p>
                        <p>12. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YA_1">Young</persName> expressed
                            worry that the conflict in Shaba and its aftermath were creating
                            confusion and instability, not just in Zaire but also in surrounding
                            countries. The economic conditions in Zaire might stimulate a flow of
                            refugees into Zambia and elsewhere. The US hoped that Cuba and Angola
                            would cooperate in advancing the negotiations for a peaceful settlement
                            in Namibia. This could pave the way for US discussions on normalizing
                            relations with Angola. All parties interests would be served by peaceful
                            settlement.</p>
                        <p>13. Rodriguez asserted strongly that Cuba was not in Africa to oppose the
                            United States. Its policy has certain principles such as supporting
                            national liberation and economic development. Cuba saw a constructive
                            role for the United States to play which was not in conflict with Cuban
                            interest.</p>
                        <p>14. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YA_1">Young</persName> commented
                            that United States interests would be served by having strong
                            independent and truly non-aligned <pb n="33" facs="0065" xml:id="pg_33"
                            />states in Africa. We are not able financially to prop-up weak
                            governments and economies all over Africa. We could participate most
                            effectively through private enterprise not the US Government. Private
                            enterprise could be flexible in working out beneficial relationships in
                            the various nations in Africa. Rodriguez nodded assent and said that the
                            Cubans had advised <persName corresp="#p_NAA_1">Neto</persName> to keep
                            Gulf Oil in Cabinda. He said they made a distinction, however, between
                            “private means and US private investment” (it was not clear what he
                            meant).</p>
                        <p>15. Returning to the subject of Namibia, Rodriguez said he had talked
                            with Mr. Lane, the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> representative
                            in Havana, some time ago and that Mr. Lane had asked about withdrawal of
                            Angolan and Cuban troops from the Namibian border. Rodriguez said he had
                            told Lane that the Cubans would not tell <persName corresp="#p_NAA_1"
                                >Neto</persName> what to do. However, the Cubans are convinced that
                                <persName corresp="#p_NAA_1">Neto</persName> would withdraw if he
                            had guarantees that South Africa would not attack Angola.</p>
                        <p>16. Cuba’s position vis-a-vis the Zimbabwian and <gloss
                                target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss> leaders was that they (the Cubans)
                            would support whatever solution the nationalist leaders decided upon.
                            The Cubans were not influencing them to fight rather than negotiate.</p>
                        <p>17. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YA_1">Young</persName> explained the
                            Western position on Walvis Bay. Rodriguez responded that separation of
                            Walvis Bay from Namibia posed a problem of principle for the Namibians
                            and the Cubans agreed with their position. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_YA_1">Young</persName> continued with his explanation
                            saying that the Western powers simply could not get South Africa to give
                            up Walvis Bay at this time. He felt, however, this could be done in the
                            future, because South Africa, he believed, wants the kind of
                            relationship with Namibia that it has with Mozambique.</p>
                        <p>18. Rodriguez said he wanted to shift back to US-Cuba relations which
                            they had touched on at the beginning of the meeting. He then emphasized
                            that the US and Cuba should avoid annoyances in their relationship. He
                            requested that US leaders, in judging Cuban policies and actions, be
                            careful to base its judgements on facts and reality, not on rumors and
                            suspicions. He urged that the US examine carefully what is actually
                            happening in Africa and what the Cubans are doing.</p>
                        <p>19. Concerning the possibility of Cuba providing armed assistance to a
                            government or to the Zimbabwian nationalists, the US could not expect a
                            blanket commitment in advance that Cuba would not put troops into
                            Zimbabwe, but that does not mean that they intend to send troops. But to
                            make such a commitment publicly would only encourage <persName
                                corresp="#p_SRP_1">Smith</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1"
                                >Vorster</persName> to continue to hold out and refuse any
                            compromise. The reality was, however, that Cuba would not move its
                            troops from Angola to Zimbabwe.</p>
                        <p>20. Rodriguez emphasized that Cuba did not want to be treated with a
                            double standard by the United States. It was “incomprehensible” <pb
                                n="34" facs="0066" xml:id="pg_34"/>that the US should condone French
                            statements that France would remain permanently in Africa while
                            condemning Cuba’s presence.</p>
                        <p>21. Rodriguez said he feared US leaders were “creating a Frankenstein” in
                            US public opinion which would make impossible for some time
                            normalization of relations between the US and Cuba. He urged that we try
                            to improve the political and emotional climate surrounding US-Cuban
                            relations.</p>
                        <p>22. The subject of Soviet-Cuban relations came up and Rodriguez said that
                            the US should not believe that any US-Cuba agreements would break Cuba’s
                            close relationship with the Soviet Union. The meeting ended on that note
                            as Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YA_1">Young</persName> excused

                        <p>2446. For the President and Secretary of State from <persName
                                corresp="#p_YA_1">Andrew Young</persName>. Subject: US Africa
                            Policy: Shaba Soviet/Cuban Involvement.</p>
                        <p>1. It is important that we not allow the Africans to escape the lesson of
                            the Shaba.<note n="2" xml:id="d13fn2">See <ref target="#d99">Documents
                                    99</ref>–<ref target="#d111">111</ref>.</note> It is the
                            Africans who have by commission or omission permitted the Soviets and
                            Cubans to play an increasingly active military role in Africa, enough to
                            influence some very important African political developments. It is
                            important that the Africans understand that tolerance of a Soviet/Cuban
                            role inevitably will lead to Africa’s becoming an East-West cockpit in
                            which outside powers will contend. It is important that these
                            countries—so vulnerable to outside intervention—understand precisely
                            that Cuban intervention does legitimize intervention by others and
                            Africa’s long run interest lies in strengthening the political and
                            institutional obstacles to outside intervention.</p>
                        <p>2. I believe it essential therefore that we go on to challenge the
                            Africans and to show them how to meet that challenge. By that I mean we
                            should press the Africans to go beyond slogans and to act as <pb n="35"
                                facs="0067" xml:id="pg_35"/>Africans to solve African problems, and
                            to develop the kinds of African approaches required for this purpose.
                            This is a tall order, and at least initially will require a more
                            realistic assessment by Africans of the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1"
                                >OAU</gloss>, which has failed miserably to meet African
                            needs—witness Chad, Ethiopia/Somalia and the Shaba.<note n="3"

                            in finding ways, without direct U.S. involvement, to deal more
                            effectively with African problems. For example, we could encourage the
                            Africans to develop institutions and codes of conduct to deal with the
                            problem of ethnic minorities—the most explosive political problem in the
                            continent because of the irrationality of colonial borders. There are
                            some foundation stones on which to build. At the last General Assembly
                            the Nigerians proposed the creation of regional human rights commissions
                            in regions that now did not have them.<note n="4" xml:id="d13fn4">On
                                March 8, the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Commission on Human
                                Rights adopted Resolution 24 (XXXIV) which requested that the
                                Secretary-General consider arranging regional seminars to discuss
                                “the advisability of establishing regional commissions on human
                                rights where none existed.” (<hi rend="italic">Yearbook of the
                                    United Nations, 1978</hi>, p. 720)</note> We could push this
                            idea along with the thought that the first task of the African
                            commission should be to deal with the rights and responsibilities of
                            ethnic minorities in African states.</p>
                        <p>3. In the area of peacekeeping we should urge the Africans to have
                            recourse to the Security Council where their influence can command the
                            resources needed for effective peacekeeping in Africa. In the Council,
                            the Africans can most effectively control the rivalries of outside
                            powers. The <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> has the experience and
                            status to do the job.</p>
                        <p>4. We might also challenge other involved outside powers to agree to
                            establish certain limits on their actions. Thus, we could declare our
                            intention never to introduce nuclear weapons or new more dangerous forms
                            of conventional weapons into Africa and work to exact similar pledges
                            from others: We could offer never to support intervention in an African
                            state without seeking Security Council endorsement provided the Soviet
                            Union made the same commitment.</p>
                        <p>5. Specifically we might offer to work to stop all intervention in the
                            Zaire-Angola conflict and attempt to secure borders against all overt
                            and covert attack.</p>
                        <p>6. I recognize that there are complexities in such proposals. But I urge
                            that you commission an urgent study aimed at developing specific ideas,
                            such as the ones I suggested, on how Africans can more effectively act
                            to deal with their own problems. The study should consider political,
                            economic and military options. Ideally, we should develop <pb n="36"

                                Foreign Policy File, D780255–0554)</note> You will remember that
                            Andy suggested State initiate a study aimed at developing specific
                            ideas, considering political, economic and military options, on how the
                            Africans can more effectively deal with their own problems. He
                            recommended that the study be developed, in consultation with principal
                            African leaders, in advance of the Khartoum meeting of the <gloss
                                target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> heads of government, and that our
                            efforts be directed toward assuring that the focus of that meeting will
                            be a serious effort at African <pb n="37" facs="0069" xml:id="pg_37"
                            />problem-solving. Andy’s specific proposals included realistic
                            reassessment of the role of the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>,
                            encouraging recourse to the Security Council for peacekeeping support,
                            challenging outside powers to voluntarily limit their actions in Africa,
                            and emphasizing that tolerance of Cuban intervention legitimizes
                            intervention by others.</p>
                        <p>Most posts enthusiastically supported Andy’s initiative in general. They
                            are in agreement that the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> is
                            incapable of solving Africa’s problems, but doubt the acceptability
                            and/or advisability of an increased <gloss target="#t_UNSC_1"
                                >UNSC</gloss> role. Most wholeheartedly endorse expanded
                            consultations with African leaders, but many add that the U.S. must
                            retain a capability to respond rapidly to challenges such as the Shaba
                            crisis. Following are summaries of the more significant available

                            Limiting Soviet/Cuban Influence in Africa</p>
                        <p>It is in the interest of the U.S. (and of other Western nations): to have
                            a peaceful and stable Africa of independent nations where Soviet/Cuban
                            influence is not predominant and where the level of Soviet presence and
                            involvement does not alter the overall global balance between the U.S.
                            and the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>; to achieve the
                            modernization and material improvement which Africans desire by helping
                            them to help themselves; to help the Africans achieve their goals of
                            human dignity, social justice and majority rule; to preserve reasonable
                            and non-discriminatory access to Africa’s mineral, agricultural, and
                            marine resources; and to focus the inevitable US-Soviet competition into
                            peaceful economic, trade, cultural, informational, and diplomatic
                            channels.</p>
                        <p>Most African nations lack the expertise and resources to resolve their
                            problems and are compelled to seek external assistance. Africans would
                            therefore strongly resist any Western effort to brand all Soviet/Cuban
                            involvement in Africa as “unacceptable”. Indeed, Soviet and Cuban
                            efforts in economic development, health care, technical educa<pb n="40"
                                facs="0072" xml:id="pg_40"/>tion and food production are
                            “acceptable” to us as well as to the Africans. It is the use of
                            large-scale military efforts coupled with Soviet/Cuban political
                            spoiling tactics which are “unacceptable” to the U.S., particularly when
                            they encourage African leaders to seek military solutions to problems
                            which cannot be resolved militarily and make more difficult the
                            negotiated resolution of disputes.</p>
                        <p>The long-term impact of Soviet/Cuban involvement in Africa is the subject
                            of vigorous debate. At one end of the range of opinion is the view that
                            the Soviets and Cubans cannot be dislodged once they have acquired a
                            position of dominance. As a consequence, the division of position and
                            influence in Africa between East and West could be changed to our
                            disadvantage, and the global balance shifted in favor of the Soviets,
                            depending on the strategic importance of the African nation taken over.
                            Other observers, however, believe that the Soviets have demonstrated
                            they can maintain a position of dominance only where they are able to
                            station substantial military forces and have shown repeatedly that they
                            are unable to maintain a close relationship with an African nation, in
                            part because of their heavy-handed behavior, but more fundamentally
                            because as they attempt to utilize a position of influence to pursue
                            their own objectives, they erode and ultimately lose their position of
                            dominance. Most observers believe that the history of Africa since 1945
                            clearly demonstrates the strength of African nationalism, and the skill
                            and will of African leaders to prevent the Soviets from achieving a
                            dominant position.</p>
                        <p>While the experience of the past two decades suggests that African
                            nationalism has been strong enough to keep the Soviets in the role of
                            just another foreign power, there are several significant differences
                            between the present situation and the earlier period. First, the Soviets
                            have shown a willingness to involve themselves militarily in problem
                            situations in Africa. Second, Cuban combat forces represent a new
                            element which could enable the Soviets to acquire and maintain effective
                            control in Africa in a pattern paralleling Soviet domination of Eastern
                            Europe. Third, by providing nearly all the manpower needed, the less
                            heavy-handed Cubans enable the Soviets to keep in the background. In
                            view of these differences, the balance between Soviet pressures and
                            African nationalism which prevailed during the past two decades may have
                            been altered, and as a consequence, the pattern evolved between 1955 and
                            1978 may not hold for the next two decades.<note n="2" xml:id="d16fn2"

                        <p>This Review Memorandum assesses the problems posed by Soviet/Cuban

                            months to permit the identification of any significant changes and the
                            need for additional or different counter-measures.</p>
                        <p>European attitudes toward Soviet/Cuban involvement in Africa are
                            ambivalent and the implications for policy uncertain. Europeans see a
                            challenge to their own and Western interests; would like something to be
                            done about it; and fear the consequences for global balance of an
                            inadequate Western response. However, with the exception of France, the
                            Europeans feel there is little they can do themselves, and see at least
                            as much risk as benefit in deepening Western or US support for regimes
                            like that of Zaire. Many European governments have strong reservations
                            about an African intervention force. Others think that a Western-backed
                            African bloc would be of doubtful effectiveness and might drive African
                            states unwilling to line up with the West into the arms of the Soviets.
                            On the other hand, European governments agree that every effort should
                            be made to find peaceful solutions to the increasingly more critical
                            problems of southern Africa.</p>
                        <p>The moderate and conservative Arab governments and Iran would like to see
                            Soviet/Cuban activities in Africa countered by the U.S. Morocco, Egypt,
                            and Saudi Arabia have shown the greatest concern and have been the most
                            vocal in urging us to action.</p>
                        <p>Most Latin American states are mildly concerned over and disapproving of
                            Soviet/Cuban involvement in Africa. But they regard it as a distant
                            problem not directly affecting them, and are by and large unwilling to
                            do anything about it or able to agree even on publicly condemning
                            it.</p>
                        <p>The Chinese can be expected to continue their sharp propaganda attacks on
                            Soviet/Cuban involvement in Africa and to intensify their challenge of
                            Cuba’s Non-Aligned credentials. But Peking will attempt to avoid
                            over-identification with western moves.</p>
                        <p>While Africans universally agree the Soviets are seeking influence in
                            Africa, some see this as a normal “big power” effort to serve its
                            interests while others believe the Soviets seek political and
                            ideological hegemony. Governments which rely heavily on the Soviets see
                            them as supportive and reliable. Governments which face opposition from
                            groups which are recipients of Soviet aid ascribe a conspiratorial
                            design to Soviet/Cuban behavior. Those in the middle find Soviet and
                            Cuban activities peripheral to the development needs of Africa but
                            essential to the successful resolution of southern African problems.
                            Almost none are willing to condemn or forswear all outside military
                            intervention. At the July <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> Summit,
                            the Chiefs of State, while reaffirming <gloss target="#t_OAU_1"

                            <pb n="42" facs="0074" xml:id="pg_42"/>opposition to foreign
                            intervention in the internal affairs of African states, reiterated
                            traditional <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> approval of appeals by
                            sovereign states for outside help. Still, Nigerian President <persName
                                corresp="#p_OO_1">Obasanjo</persName>, apparently articulating the
                            evolving <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> consensus, cautioned the
                            Soviets and Cubans not to overstay their welcome in Africa. Africans are
                            divided on whether the Cubans are playing an independent role or are
                            surrogates for the Soviets. A number of countries see the Cubans as a
                            useful catalyst to frighten the West into exerting greater pressure on
                            the white regimes of southern Africa. Few Africans see any alternative
                            to having the Cubans and the Soviets help equip and train the fighting
                            forces of the Namibian and Zimbabwian nationalists. Nearly all are
                            prepared to accept Soviet support to achieve black majority rule in
                            southern Africa, a goal which Africans of all political persuasions are
                            determined to achieve.</p>
                        <p>African moderate states are divided on whether Soviet/Cuban involvement
                            constitutes a threat to their freedom. Many Africans do not think that
                            there is a Cuban problem or a Soviet problem; they note that the Soviets
                            left Somalia, Egypt, and Sudan when requested to do so, and seem
                            confident that the Cubans will depart when asked. Still others believe
                            that if Western countries object to a Soviet and Cuban presence in
                            Africa, they must prevent the rise of situations in which the African
                            participants believe that Soviet or Cuban help is necessary.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Part II—Soviet and Cuban Involvement, Present and
                            Potential</p>
                        <p>The Soviets and the Cubans have nearly 60,000 civilian and military
                            personnel scattered across the African Continent; they have mounted
                            massive military aid programs; they have planned, launched, and
                            sustained extensive combat operations in support of African governments
                            which have requested their help. Although the Soviets have personnel in
                            some 35 African countries and the Cubans in 13, the recent expansion of
                            Soviet and Cuban activity has been focused principally in three areas:
                            Angola, Ethiopia, and the nations neighboring Rhodesia. (The Soviet
                            presence in Algeria and Libya dates back to an earlier period.) Cuba is
                            the principal supplier of manpower. There are now some 42 to 47 thousand
                            Cubans in Africa, including the 20,000 combat troops in Angola, the
                            17,000 in Ethiopia, and the 500 military advisors in Mozambique. In
                            addition, there are 5,000 Cuban civilian advisors in Angola, with
                            another 5,000 expected to arrive before the end of 1978. (See Annex I
                            for a more detailed inventory of Soviet and Cuban activity.)<note n="4"

                        <p>Soviet and Cuban objectives in Africa are harmonious but not necessarily
                            synonomous. The Soviets and the Cubans have developed a symbiotic
                            relationship in their African adventure which furthers both their
                            particular and mutual interests.</p>
                        <p>Soviet motivations, objectives, and intentions represent a mixture of
                            geopolitical, strategic, and ideological/political elements which differ
                            area by area on the Continent.</p>
                        <p>In the Horn the Soviets appear to calculate that if they can establish a
                            strong, permanent presence in Ethiopia, they will be in a position to
                            strengthen their strategic impact on Middle Eastern events and affect
                            the flow of oil, to project their military power east into the Indian
                            Ocean, and extend their influence west and south into Africa. At the
                            same time, active involvement in Ethiopia permits the Soviets to
                            displace the West and specifically the U.S. from a long-held position of
                            influence, to enhance their status as a great power and expand their
                            world role, and to support the ideologically compatible <persName

                        <p>Angola’s location on the South Atlantic is strategically important and
                            its proximity to foci of weakness (Zaire, Namibia) is attractive, but
                            support for an ideologically compatible liberation
                            movement-cum-government to the detriment of Western interests is equally
                            attractive and important.</p>
                        <p>Soviet involvement in Algeria and Libya reflects a similar “mix” of
                            motivation: a strategic presence on <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss>’s southern flank and the support of ideologically
                            compatible regimes plus the attraction of hard currency earnings from
                            massive arms sales.</p>
                        <p>Soviet involvement in the Rhodesian conflict in the short term is heavily

                            enables the Soviets simultaneously to associate themselves with a
                            “progressive” political grouping, to support a liberation struggle, to
                            help the member states of the Organization of African Unity achieve one
                            of their primary goals, and to undermine the position, influence, and
                            interests of the West. In the longer term, their interests may be more
                            focused on strategic influence on the events in South Africa and
                            ultimately on the geopolitical importance and resources of southern
                            Africa.</p>
                        <p>While the connecting thread of Soviet involvement in Africa is
                            opportunism, there were different circumstances and different
                            attractions in each of the areas/situations the Soviets have entered.
                            More importantly, there are differing degrees of Soviet interest,
                            involvement and commitment.</p>

                        <p>In the near term, the Soviets will not abandon their present role in
                            African affairs, and are likely to seek to consolidate, if not to extend
                            it. Nevertheless, the costs to the Soviets in terms of Soviet-US and
                            Soviet-European relations could reach proportions which could be
                            meaningful in Soviet decision-making, and give rise to some second
                            thoughts about the pace and scope of Soviet involvement in Africa, if
                            not about the long-run objective of displacing Western presence,
                            position, and influence from Africa. (See also <gloss target="#t_NIE_1"

                        <p>Cuba is not involved in Africa solely or even primarily because of its
                            relationship with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. It is
                            deeply committed to the pursuit of its own ideological and pragmatic
                            political goals there: the advancement of “The Revolution” and the
                            support of “progressive” regimes, the expansion of its own political
                            influence in the Third World at the expense of the West (read U.S.), and
                            the establishment for itself of a major leadership role among developing
                            nations.</p>
                        <p>Cuba is not likely to abandon its objectives in Africa easily or soon.
                            There are probably only three sets of circumstances which would cause
                            the Cubans to consider a drastic reduction in their presence or early
                            withdrawal:</p>
                        <p>—An explicit request from the African governments directly involved for
                            the Cubans to depart and/or an unmistakable change of mind by other
                            African governments which to date have found Cuba’s presence and
                            activities acceptable;</p>
                        <p>—A Soviet threat to withdraw or severely reduce its economic assistance
                            to Cuba unless Havana withdraws from Africa. The termination or the
                            reduction of Soviet logistical support would force the Cubans to reduce
                            their African presence, but they would not withdraw even if they had to
                            go it alone in Africa;</p>
                        <p>—Direct US military measures or the threat of US military action.</p>
                        <p>Judging from the response of Soviet officials and spokesmen to our
                            diplomatic and public “warnings”, the Soviets may have initially
                            discounted the significance and strength of our disapproval of their
                            African adventurism. Publicly, the Soviets have insisted that they are
                            active in Africa only in response to the explicit invitation of the
                            African government involved, and countered Western criticism of the
                            Soviet/Cuban role in Shaba II with accusations of Western intervention
                            and Western responsibility. Our concerns, however, have clearly
                            registered <pb n="45" facs="0077" xml:id="pg_45"/>with the Soviet
                            leadership. On June 22, the Soviets issued an official statement
                            justifying at length Soviet African policy and criticizing US and
                            Western policies and actions there.<note n="7" xml:id="d16fn7">The

                        <p>US efforts to deal with Cuban adventurism in Africa have not produced
                            substantial results so far. Our diplomatic warnings that continued Cuban

                                >Castro</persName> to review one of the “givens” of his African
                            policy—that the U.S. would not become militarily involved in Africa. It
                            is not yet clear what, if any, shifts might occur in Cuban policy as a
                            result. It is unlikely that Cuba will draw back from areas where it is
                            already heavily committed, but recent Western action might result in
                            somewhat greater caution on the part of Cuba with respect to future
                            involvements.</p>
                        <p>Cuban losses, both killed and wounded in both Angola and Ethiopia are
                            probably not in excess of 3 to 4 thousand. The highest estimate of the
                            total number killed in action is 1,200. (In comparison, 606 Cubans were
                            killed and 8,708 were injured in traffic accidents last year.) The
                            psychological impact in Cuba has been minimal. Casualties would have to
                            be much higher to be sharply felt among a population of nine million.
                            Even if the numbers were larger, the effect would still be modest
                            because of the careful management of all news. There are no casualty
                            reports; the few references to losses are couched in terms of “fallen
                            heroes” and are accompanied by patriotic appeals which have an undoubted
                            effect.</p>
                        <p>Within the next six months to one year, we believe that the Soviets and
                            Cubans will remain occupied primarily with their existing commitments to
                            Angola, Ethiopia, and the Rhodesian nationalists, although it is
                            possible that the scale of these commitments will be increased. In
                            Angola, the continuing civil war will likely require the Soviets and the
                            Cubans to make even greater commitments to protect their current
                            position. In Ethiopia, the Cubans and the Soviets continue to resist <pb
                                n="46" facs="0078" xml:id="pg_46"/>participation in a costly and
                            perhaps unwinnable battle for Eritrea. But should the Ethiopian military
                            campaign continue, it is likely that the Soviets and the Cubans will
                            eventually be drawn into a costly involvement in that conflict.
                            Alternatively, if the Soviets promote a negotiated settlement with the
                            Eritrean rebels against <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1"
                            >Mengistu</persName>’s wishes, they will receive little Ethiopian
                            gratitude. If the renewed pressure of Somali liberation forces continues
                            and expands, the Soviets and the Cubans may find it necessary to resume
                            an active role in the Ogaden fighting. In any event, the Soviets will
                            have to continue to deal with an unstable Ethiopian regime facing major
                            economic and social difficulties. Should the political stalemate
                            continue in Rhodesia, the Soviets and Cubans are expected to increase
                            their military assistance to the Rhodesian guerrillas. Cuban military
                            personnel may begin accompanying guerrilla units into Rhodesia, but we
                            doubt that Cuba is presently contemplating a major offensive in Rhodesia
                            using Cuban military units.</p>
                        <p>Over the longer term, southern Africa has the greatest potential for
                            Soviet/Cuban involvement. Zaire probably presents the best opportunity
                            for exploiting indigenous opposition to a corrupt and chronically
                            unstable regime. A post-independence Namibia is another area of
                            potential opportunity for the Soviets and the Cubans should internal
                            stability, external pressures from South Africa, or spill-over from the
                                <gloss target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss>-Angolan Government conflict
                            lead Namibian leaders to seek outside military help. The Cubans and the
                            Soviets can be expected to take advantage of opportunities which arise
                            as the result of unpredictable events, for example, the departure from
                            the scene or the death of or overthrow of current leaders, and of
                            structural weaknesses endemic to post-colonial Africa. Uganda after
                                <persName corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName> will be vulnerable to
                            subversion. Ghana and Nigeria are both in a period of political unease
                            as military leaders embark on reversion to civilian rule. There are
                            obvious uncertainties in the post-Kenyatta scene in Kenya.</p>

                        <p>US actions to counter Soviet/Cuban involvement in Africa should be keyed
                            to the following long-term goals: a peaceful transition to majority rule
                            in southern Africa; the orderly social and economic development of the
                            nations of Africa; and a strengthened Organization of African Unity
                                (<gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>) and its member states to
                            resolve the underlying causes of inter-African conflict. Flowing from
                            these goals are shorter-term objectives: the removal of the immediate
                            occasions for outside intervention in African affairs; the removal of
                            Cuban combat troops from the Continent; and an increase in the costs to

                            approach to Africa. Careful diplomatic work in the Organization of

                            African disputes. Our Western European allies (particularly France)
                            might be persuasive with certain countries, such as the radical Arab
                            states who would discount or dismiss US approaches. If pressed by us, 3
                            or 4 Latin American states might raise US concern over Cuba’s military
                            involvement in Africa with Havana, but we cannot expect much in the way
                            of direct results. We could continue our efforts directly and through
                            our European, Arab, and African friends to convince selected members of

                        <p>By maintaining a continuing dialogue with Africans of all persuasions, we
                            can strengthen our credibility and influence in Africa. This influence
                            can help us in turn to frustrate Soviet/Cuban aspirations by enabling us
                            to contribute effectively to arranging negotiated settlements. Opening
                            or expanding existing relations with some countries which have been
                            close to the Soviets and the Cubans also provides those states with an
                            “option” to the West; it increases their flexibility of policy and
                            behavior, and encourages them to utilize it. While there is potentially
                            a risk that the aid we might provide could enable the recipient
                            government to utilize its own resources for military purposes and
                            continue its military relationship with the Soviets and the Cubans, we
                            should be able to avoid the types or amounts of assistance which <pb
                                n="48" facs="0080" xml:id="pg_48"/>would free resources for military
                            equipment or operations. On the other hand, a decision to limit US
                            interaction with African states which permit or encourage Soviet/Cuban
                            involvement could increase the economic cost to the Soviets of their
                            activities, sharpen African awareness of the inadequacy of Soviet
                            assistance, and deter other governments from support of Soviet/Cuban
                            actions. But such a US cut-off would heighten the East-West
                            confrontation in Africa and be sharply criticized by most African
                            states.</p>
                        <p>Ongoing arms control negotiations which have direct substantive linkages
                            to Soviet activities in Africa, e.g. the Indian Ocean talks, and the
                            Conventional Arms Transfer (<gloss target="#t_CAT_1">CAT</gloss>)
                            restraint talks might be utilized—to call the Soviets to task for their
                            military activities in Africa and to show them that an alternative
                            cooperative course for protecting their interests is open to them. There
                            is no evidence thus far, however, that the Soviets are prepared to limit
                            their political options in Africa by forswearing their only effective
                            resource tool: arms; or that the pace or content of the Indian Ocean
                            talks will influence Soviet African policy measurably. On those arms
                            control negotiations which do not have direct substantive linkage to
                            Africa, e.g. <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>, we can continue to
                            make clear to the Soviets that progress is made difficult when Soviet
                            activities are raising tensions and adversely affecting public and
                            Congressional attitudes.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Economic Assistance</hi>—Development assistance is
                            one of the strong cards that we and our Western partners hold in the
                            competition with Soviet/Cuban military aid diplomacy in Africa. A
                            vigorous development assistance effort permits us both to identify the
                            US and the West with the long-term aspirations of the peoples and
                            leaders of Africa and to counter Soviet ambitions in the short-term by
                            strengthening our presence on the ground. If our economic aid program in
                            Africa were substantially increased in size and scope—perhaps from $467
                            million proposed in FY 79 to some $950 million in FY 80 and to include
                            infrastructure for river basin development and relieving transportation
                            and communications bottlenecks, and to expand training, health and
                            energy programs—it could be more effective. At the same time, the very
                            substantial US and Western commitments to African development, together
                            with clear assurances of major increases to address problems which the
                            Africans consider critical, need to be made more visible. Africa’s most
                            basic problems are long term and require long term solutions. (See Annex
                            VIII, in particular VIII–B, for a more complete and detailed exposition
                            of the contribution development assistance can make to the achievement
                            of US objectives in Africa.)</p>
                        <p>The West also offers African nations the most lucrative markets for their
                            exports, access to capital, the highest quality goods and the most
                            advanced technology available in nearly every field.</p>
                        <pb n="49" facs="0081" xml:id="pg_49"/>
                        <p>But the impact of these Western economic assets is generally long-term.
                            We cannot counter Soviet/Cuban military assistance directly with long
                            term contributions to African development. We need flexibility to
                            devise, in coordination with other Western governments, an array of
                            short-term and long-term economic tools which will permit the fashioning
                            of integrated economic packages that are responsive to urgent needs.
                            Such packages should include not only development assistance, which
                            addresses both immediate and longer term requirements, plus incentives
                            for foreign investment and access to Western markets and technology, but
                            also short-term assistance, balance of payments and budget support, and
                            export financing. In this way, economic instruments could be used more
                            effectively, with other policy tools to help offset Soviet and Cuban
                            initiatives by demonstrating the economic advantages which association
                            with the West affords Africa.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Military Related Measures</hi>—Military measures
                            will not be successful in and of themselves in achieving US objectives
                            in Africa. But combined with diplomatic and economic initiatives,
                            security assistance—arms transfers, military training, military
                            construction activity—could reduce the incentive of countries to seek
                            Soviet assistance and could contribute to improved US–African relations.
                            US policy restraints together with practical limitations (e.g. a
                            country’s ability to absorb materiel or training) will continue to keep
                            US security assistance to Africa at a modest level. The U.S. might
                            support African peacekeeping efforts. The U.S. can encourage other
                            countries to shoulder some of the burden of checking the Soviet Union
                            and Cuba in Africa by providing funds, equipment and forces. While it is
                            not US policy at this time to send US combat forces to Africa, we can
                            demonstrate our capability to project our power in Africa by providing
                            logistics support to African, European or international organization
                            forces operating in Africa and by scheduling Navy port visits or
                            organizing joint training exercises with the military forces of selected
                            African nations. There are numerous military actions which could be
                            taken against Cuba or the Soviet Union and their military
                            forces—increasing the surveillance of Soviet <gloss target="#t_ELINT_1"
                                >ELINT</gloss> ships, aerial reconnaissance flights over Cuba,
                            increased air and sea surveillance of Cuban aircraft and ships, etc. The
                            U.S. could also encourage nations whose airspace is being used by
                            Soviet/Cuban aircraft on route to Africa to deny them overflight
                            clearance and to challenge the overflying aircraft. However, such
                            actions would not stop Soviet/Cuban activities in Africa, and the wisdom
                            of turning to such measures to communicate our concern over Soviet/Cuban
                            involvement in Africa is subject to vigorous debate.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Enlisting the Support of Allies and Friends</hi>—The
                            political pressures which our allies and other friends can bring to bear

                            of potential <pb n="50" facs="0082" xml:id="pg_50"/>effectiveness. They
                            could provide economic support and development assistance to vulnerable
                            African nations who wish to resist. France, Morocco and a small number
                            of other nations have already provided military support in the form of
                            equipment, training, logistics help, and combat troops.</p>
                        <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Economic and Financial Incentives and
                                Disincentives</hi>—Neither US bilateral nor multilateral economic or
                            financial measures directed at Cuba appear to offer a sufficient
                            negative cost or positive inducement to produce a change in Cuban
                            African policy. Bilateral US sanctions already preclude most economic
                            contact, and the Cubans have made it clear that a normalization of
                            US-Cuban relations does not provide sufficient incentive to change. The
                            imposition of multilaterally agreed upon economic/financial sanctions
                            (particularly the curtailment of official credits and export guarantees
                            and private credits) could impose significant economic penalties on
                            Havana, and on Moscow if it felt compelled to pick up the slack on
                            behalf of Cuba. But the extensive international cooperation required to
                            make such sanctions effective would be extremely difficult to achieve. A
                            mandatory multilateral trade embargo of Cuba would require <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Security Council action which would be
                            subject to Soviet veto. Our allies are most unlikely to agree to an
                            informal embargo of Cuba. Such sanctions would involve serious political
                            and important economic costs to us and to our allies. As a result,
                            Cuba’s European and Asian trading partners are not likely to cut back
                            their trade with Cuba or curtail the flow of credit to Havana.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. could exert limited economic pressure on the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> (through tightening technology
                            transfer and trade, including a reduction in grain shipments). But
                            experience suggests that economic pressures and trade incentives do not
                            have significant impact on Soviet behavior. In addition, there are
                            severe domestic constraints on such pressures, not only on grain
                            exports, but increasingly on other exports as well. A US effort to
                            obtain multilateral agreement to limit trade with the Soviets or to
                            restrict credit flows is unlikely to succeed in the face of Western and
                            Japanese unwillingness to terminate government-supported credits or
                            extend trade restrictions to non-strategic items. Allied reluctance is
                            occasioned not only by the prospective impact on their own economies of
                            such measures, but also by their judgment (which we share) that such
                            measures would be largely ineffective in furthering our common political
                            objectives.</p>
                        <p>A range of positive and negative measures which could be used to
                            influence the policies of African governments also exists. Expanded

                            long term. The negative measures (trade embargos, the blockage of
                            assets, the slow-down of lending and assistance programs) would require
                            not only Western but Arab oil <pb n="51" facs="0083" xml:id="pg_51"

                            and Third World backlash, and run counter to other US economic
                            policies.</p>

                            groupings in Africa regardless of their support or acquiescence in

                            the resources required for the success of our African strategy?</p>
                        <p>3. In the Military sphere:</p>
                        <p>—Should we increase our military assistance programs in Africa

                        <p>C. Specific Issues and Situations—OPTIONS:</p>
                        <p>The options below are designed to draw together for conceptual purposes
                            varying sets of hypothetical choices, which appear to have an internal
                            consistency of approach, from among the issues for decision described
                            above in III, B. It would of course be possible to construct differing
                            options by choosing somewhat differently from among the decision issues.
                            The following options are, in addition, designed for the coming year.
                            Their success or failure, judged in terms of results in Africa during
                            that period, would determine any need for further review. In Part I, it
                            was suggested that an assessment of the situation be made after a
                            year.</p>
                        <p>All of the policy options we have identified have a common set of
                            assumptions:</p>
                        <p>—that the U.S. will continue to pursue its efforts to secure a peaceful
                            transition to majority rule in southern Africa;</p>
                        <p>—that we will continue to emphasize economic and social development in
                            our assistance strategy for Africa;</p>
                        <p>—that our military assistance to African nations will continue to be
                            selective and measured;</p>
                        <p>—that direct US military involvement in Africa will be limited to
                            logistics support for the combat forces of others;</p>
                        <p>—that the U.S. will continue to stress the need for Africans to develop
                            their own efforts to resolve local disputes and to develop their own
                            peacekeeping capabilities;</p>
                        <p>—that the US Government in concert with other like-minded governments,
                            will continue to stress to the Soviets and the Cubans the destabilizing
                            effects of their unrestrained arms transfers and their pursuit of
                            military adventurism in Africa.</p>
                        <p>It is also assumed that there will be no major shift in Soviet/Cuban
                            policies in the next 6 to 12 months.</p>
                        <p>OPTION 1:</p>
                        <p>To continue to pursue present policies aimed at peaceful resolution of
                            disputes, focus military assistance programs on a limited number of key,
                            friendly African states to strengthen their defense capabilities, but
                            with close attention to our arms transfer restraint objectives, provide
                            limited logistics support on a case by case basis for third country
                            military forces requested by an African state under attack from outside
                            its borders, increase economic assistance and other resource flows, and
                            emphasize the need for African resolution of local disputes. Within this
                            framework, the U.S. would encourage key African leaders to revitalize
                            the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>, urge <gloss target="#t_OAU_1"

                            sub-regional groups of African countries to promote the peaceful
                            resolution of specific conflicts, work towards an arms transfer
                            restraint regime in the next <gloss target="#t_CAT_1">CAT</gloss>
                            negotiating session, and persist in our efforts to exert international
                            pressure on the Soviets and Cubans (through the <gloss target="#t_NAM_1"
                                >NAM</gloss> and other channels) to limit their military activities
                            in Africa and to withdraw their combat forces from the Continent. (See
                            pp 47–48 for a detailed presentation of the specific actions to be taken
                            in West and Central Africa, in the Horn, and in southern Africa.)</p>
                        <p>PRO: This course is essentially an indirect, African-focused approach to
                            the Soviets and the Cubans. It leaves us free to concentrate our
                            attention on our longer-term goals in Africa, places the U.S. in the
                            role of peacemaker while casting the Soviets and the Cubans as
                            “meddlers”, provides a measure of reassurance to moderate African
                            leaders, avoids polarization of African forces, emphasizes US advantages
                            in the economic and technical assistance fields, and minimizes East-West
                            confrontational aspects of our strategy.</p>
                        <p>CON: This course does not meet directly the challenge of the on-going
                            Soviet/Cuban activities or lead to short-term reduction in Soviet/Cuban
                            presence or involvement in Africa. It may leave some moderate African
                            and Arab states with a sense of uncertainty as to whether the U.S. is
                            willing to counter Soviet/Cuban military activity in Africa and about
                            their own security.</p>
                        <p>OPTION 2:</p>
                        <p>In addition to the steps in Option 1, to intensify efforts to support
                            friendly governments which are concerned about Soviet/Cuban activities
                            with substantially increased military and economic assistance, encourage
                            efforts by the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> to buttress African
                            peacekeeping capabilities, and use diplomatic means to mobilize European
                            and Non-Aligned sentiment against Soviet/Cuban actions. Within this
                            framework, the U.S. would engage in a vigorous diplomatic campaign to
                            seek condemnation of Cuba in the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>
                            and the Non-Aligned Movement, focus <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss> and other non-African government attention on the
                            dangers posed by Soviet/Cuban actions in Africa, and move immediately,
                            with Congressional approval, to increase significantly not only our
                            economic development aid but also our security supporting assistance and
                                <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> credits for African countries.
                            If an <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> peacekeeping force were
                            established, we would offer logistics support.</p>
                        <p>PRO: This course of action provides greater reassurance to France,
                            Belgium and moderate African and Arab states of US willingness and
                            determination to support efforts to stabilize the situation in Africa
                            and to counter in tangible ways Soviet/Cuban involvement. It reserves
                            the US position in the event that even more drastic action might have to
                                <pb n="54" facs="0086" xml:id="pg_54"/>be taken should Soviet/Cuban
                            actions be markedly stepped-up. It stresses continuing US support for
                            peacekeeping by the Africans themselves.</p>
                        <p>CON: The increases projected in economic and military aid impose
                            difficult budget choices. Congressional reaction to increased US
                            military supply to Africa is likely to be negative. Reaction to greater
                            development assistance transfers may be less sharp but is still likely
                            to be adverse. Some African “progressive” states may regard this track
                            as provocative and likely to lead to polarization unless it is balanced
                            by intensified US diplomatic and other actions aimed at South Africa and
                            Rhodesia. It is doubtful that the <gloss target="#t_NAM_1">NAM</gloss>
                            will respond conclusively or effectively against Cuban military
                            involvement. Certain elements of this course, if mishandled, could risk
                            diplomatic rupture with Ethiopia, a failure in efforts to improve
                            relations with Angola, and greater polarization of Africa along
                            East-West lines.</p>
                        <p>OPTION 3:</p>
                        <p>To adopt a policy of direct and clear cut opposition to Soviet/Cuban
                            activity in Africa, using bilateral US-Soviet and US-Cuban relations as
                            a means of increasing pressures. Within this framework, the U.S. would,
                            in addition to the measures described in Options 1 and 2, intensify its
                            public denunciation of the Soviets and the Cubans particularly if there
                            is any increase in Soviet/Cuban military activity, call explicitly for
                                <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> or individual African
                            government opposition to Soviet/Cuban involvement, and seek to create a
                            consortium of European-African-Arab states to support regional or
                            individual African state efforts to strengthen their security and resist
                            Soviet/Cuban incursions. The U.S. would make clear through specific
                            actions that US-Soviet and US-Cuban bilateral economic, exchange,
                            technological, and other relationships would suffer as a result of
                            Soviet and Cuban African policies. The U.S. would launch efforts to
                            persuade our allies to join us in applying economic and financial
                            sanctions against Cuba. The U.S. would also announce its intention to
                            increase markedly its military assistance programs in Africa, including
                            the provision of more sophisticated military equipment to countries
                            threatened by the Soviet/Cuban presence. We would consult on an urgent
                            basis with our European allies, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Morocco
                            on establishing a coordinated strategy for resource transfers to
                            sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
                        <p>PRO: This course of action establishes clearly US will and determination
                            to deal with Soviet/Cuban “meddling” in Africa. It reinforces our
                            general strategy for southern Africa, leaves the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and Cuba enmeshed in a no-win
                            situation in Eritrea, and meets rising moderate African-Arab
                            concerns.</p>
                        <p>CON: This course of action puts the problems of Africa into a sharply
                            defined East-West context, and would as a consequence draw <pb n="55"
                                facs="0087" xml:id="pg_55"/>fire from Nigeria, Tanzania, and other
                            influential African governments. It would further polarize African
                            opinion, antagonize the Front Line states, and severely hamper our
                            ability to work with them on southern African issues. More
                            significantly, it risks the escalation of African conflicts, and raises
                            the very real possibility of greater US military involvement in Africa.
                            This course of action will convince South Africa that it has nothing to
                            gain from further collaboration on Rhodesia and Namibia. Finally, this
                            track would be difficult to sustain in terms of Congressional and public
                            opinion, of allied cooperation, or of our other foreign policy
                            objectives.</p>

                            perceive the U.S. as reacting to events in Africa on a piece-meal basis
                            rather than within a coherent policy framework, are unsure over the
                            direction of US policy toward the Soviet Union, and are apprehensive
                            that US involvement in Africa to counter Soviet/Cuban expansionism could
                            ensnare us in another Viet Nam.</p>
                        <p>An effective public posture—at home and abroad—would build on the major
                            policy statements about US-<gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and
                            US-African relations recently made by the President and the Secretary of
                            State in which they set forth our view of Africa, defined our long-term
                            purpose in positive terms, and outlined the type of relationship we
                            desire and expect to have with the Soviets and the Cubans in the African
                            context. Abroad, our public diplomacy strategy would: reinforce our
                            positive, <pb n="56" facs="0088" xml:id="pg_56"/>forward-looking policy
                            toward Africa; work to remove the “mantle of legitimacy” from
                            Soviet/Cuban involvement; communicate American support for long-term
                            development, for social justice, independence and stability in Africa;
                            stimulate an international consensus against continued Soviet and Cuban
                            military involvement; and encourage African efforts to develop ground
                            rules to contain and reduce Soviet/Cuban military activities and to
                            evolve African institutional capabilities for the peaceful resolution of
                            conflicts.</p>
                        <p>At home, an effective public posture would reiterate that our
                            relationship with the Soviet Union is at once competitive and
                            cooperative, that our African strategy is long-range and is directed at
                            helping African peoples and their leaders solve the fundamental problems
                            confronting them, and that the U.S. need have no fears about the
                            long-range outcome of a vigorous competition with the Soviets in Africa.
                            It would emphasize that Soviet/Cuban influence in Africa is still
                            limited, that the West enjoys decided advantages there, and that the
                            U.S. has greatly enhanced its position and significantly increased its
                            influence in Africa in the last two years. It would, finally, note that
                            our long-range strategy requires a long-term commitment of support, and
                            appeal to the people and the Congress to have the patience and
                            determination to stay the course.</p>
                        <p>We believe that sufficient public and Congressional support can be
                            mustered to approve and implement a range of countermeasures—short of
                            committing US troops. However, any approach to the Congress for support
                            and for additional resources, and in particular any effort by the
                            Executive Branch to secure the lifting of the constraints which have
                            been imposed by Congress over the past few years, will result in a full
                            scale debate of the entire range of questions involved.</p>

                            countries in order to build support for an international boycott of the
                            Moscow Olympics, initiated after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.

                            <item>Report on My Recent Trip Through Four African Countries [<hi
                                    rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>]</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>1. I recently paid visits to [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                                declassified</hi>]. My principal observations are:</p>
                        <p>a. Leaders of all countries expressed concern over external threats to
                            their security.</p>
                        <p>b. All of the countries face formidable long-term internal security
                            problems, though none faces imminent threats. Considerable concern was
                            expressed at the internal threat posed by the example of Sergeant Doe’s
                            successful coup in Liberia.<note n="2" xml:id="d18fn2">See <ref
                                    target="#d55">Documents 55</ref> and <ref target="#d56"
                                >56</ref>.</note></p>
                        <p>c. Uniformly there were strong complaints at the unwillingness of the
                            United States to supply arms to these countries. [<hi rend="italic">less
                                than 1 line not declassified</hi>], for instance, claimed that all
                            of his friends are coming to look on the Soviets as the only people on
                            whom they can rely. While this is an exaggeration, I did sense that the
                            Soviets have created a belief of Soviet momentum throughout Africa as a
                            result of the number and wide variety of their activities.</p>
                        <p><pb n="58" facs="0090" xml:id="pg_58"/>d. The general quest for more arms
                            in part relates to the expressed concerns about external threats, but
                            also in large part to the importance for these leaders of being able to
                            placate their own military. The concern over the Liberian example is
                            typical of this. It did not appear to me that any of these countries was
                            in real need of military aid. In the first instance, the external
                            threats are not that great. In the second, they are not equipped to
                            handle advanced weaponry. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                                declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>—[<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph (12 lines) not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>—In short, what the military forces of countries like these really need
                            is to have a sense of discipline, organization and mission instilled in
                            them. [<hi rend="italic">2 lines not declassified</hi>] It occurs to me
                            that the most genuine assistance which the U.S. could offer to the
                            leaders of these countries is training advisers. Fifty or sixty U.S.
                            Army or Marine Corps personnel, ranging from Sergeant to Major, [<hi
                                rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>], could whip
                            those battalions into shape over a period of a year or so. [<hi
                                rend="italic">3 lines not declassified</hi>] Even two crack
                            battalions, however, [<hi rend="italic">2 lines not declassified</hi>].
                            The provision of training assistants would not be expensive. It need not
                            involve <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> or <gloss
                                target="#t_IMET_1">IMET</gloss> since no equipment would be involved
                            nor would there be mobile training teams (MTTs). Those teach specific
                            functions for a limited period of time, whereas what the military forces
                            of these countries need is to have our people living and working with
                            them in order to establish performance standards for them. Their
                            continued presence would ensure performance towards those standards.
                            Politically, the presence of U.S. training advisers may not be
                            acceptable in many African countries. Still, the offer to support a
                            genuine need would, I believe, stand us in good stead over the long run.
                            In contrast, the Soviet provision of unnecessary equipment such as
                                <gloss target="#t_SA3_1">SA–3s</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_MIG21_1">MIG–21s</gloss> may well have a deleterious

                            afford to take a strong stand themselves.</p>

                        <p>I want to report to you on the results of my just-completed visit to
                            Nigeria, Senegal, Kenya and Zimbabwe. I took to these countries a
                            delegation of our senior appointees in science and technology (e.g.
                            heads of <gloss target="#t_NASA_1">NASA</gloss>, <gloss
                                target="#t_NSF_1">NSF</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_NIH_1">NIH</gloss>,

                            achieved our goals of initiating or enhancing cooperation in major areas
                            of development. In particular, in Nigeria and Senegal we followed up on
                            your recent visits. (U)</p>
                        <p>I met with Prime Minister Mugabe, Presidents Moi and Senghor and the
                            Nigerian Vice President. All hold our country in the highest esteem. All
                            are flattered and grateful for the President’s sending the delegation,
                            both for the political message it implies and the technological
                            cooperation it portends. Each—including President Shagari—is writing the
                            President to express his appreciation. (U)</p>
                        <p>At each of the four stops I signed an agreement for cooperation in
                            science and technology. These are to some extent symbolic but do provide
                            a very useful framework for cooperation. We also signed specific
                            agreements for carrying out major projects with the host countries.
                            These are in areas of priority identified by those countries, typically
                            agriculture and fisheries, energy, health, remote sensing, management
                            and manpower training. For all except Nigeria—which will pay for the
                            assistance it gets—these projects will be funded by <gloss
                                target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> or the technical agencies, using money
                            which is already programmed. (U)</p>
                        <p>Mugabe said he was sorry he couldn’t come back to help in the campaign!
                            He expressed his strong support for US-Zimbabwean cooperation in <gloss
                                target="#t_ST_1">S&amp;T</gloss>. Zimbabwe has been most fortunate
                            in inheriting valuable mineral and agricultural resources, an industrial
                            base, and a (white) managerial class, albeit a nervous and resentful
                            one. They will need a growing competence in their black technocrats to
                            succeed in reconstructing the country, reshaping its society, and
                            providing a better life for the poor, rural blacks. (U)</p>

                            results of our stop in Lagos prior to his visit next week. Our mission
                            there accomplished all its objectives, including the signing of an
                                <gloss target="#t_ST_1">S&amp;T</gloss> agreement and reimbursable
                            agreements in several areas of agriculture (soil surveys, training,
                            technical assistance), the environment (oil spills, environmental impact
                            statements), fisheries and oceanography. (U)</p>
                        <p>President Senghor told me of his eagerness to obtain technical assistance
                            and training opportunities from the U.S. Why, he asked, should Senegal
                            get technology from France and the other Europeans when they themselves
                            obtained it from the U.S.? He was very pleased by the opportunities
                            presented as a result of our visit. Senghor said he is most supportive
                            of our efforts regarding Afghanistan, and critical in this regard of
                            Giscard and <persName corresp="#p_SH_1">Schmidt</persName>. (C)</p>
                        <p>These high-level <gloss target="#t_ST_1">S&amp;T</gloss> visits have many
                            benefits. In addition to agreements realized, they result in personal
                            contacts made by senior counterparts of the two sides. These should
                            serve to develop and facilitate further opportunities for cooperation.
                            Also, my meetings with heads of state serve to elevate the status of
                                <gloss target="#t_ST_1">S&amp;T</gloss> leaders of those states,
                            leaders who could contribute significantly to development if they have
                            status and clout. (U)</p>
                        <p>Above all, these visits serve to bring into play in our foreign policy a
                            major but under-utilized asset of our country: our leadership of the
                            world’s science and technology. Each of these four countries is eager
                            for our technological help. With each, increasing technological bonds
                            will undoubtedly lead to stronger political ties. As a result of the
                            visits, I believe that each of the four countries will reorder its
                            priorities on what it seeks from the U.S. They will capitalize on our
                            particular strength and seek relatively more technological assistance
                            from us. (U)</p>
                        <p>As a result of this trip I believe more than ever that U.S. bilateral aid
                            should emphasize technological assistance and <gloss target="#t_PL_1"
                                >PL</gloss> 480 food; concessional aid should be shifted to the
                            World Bank and other international lending agencies. This approach need
                            cost us no more than what we spend now. At the present time major
                            opportunities are available to us for little additional funds. By
                            reprogramming some $10 million (less than 10% of our assistance to these
                            countries), we can develop a technological assistance program that would
                            serve to solve many problems of Zimbabwe, Kenya and Senegal and bring us
                            many political benefits. I will be pursuing this through the budgetary
                            process. (U)</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_OO_1">Obasanjo</persName> stated he saw important
                            possibilities now for improved collaboration between our two countries.
                            He then told me he could not understand why “major American companies,
                            for example in construction, were not taking a greater interest in the
                            Nigerian market.”</p>
                        <p>2. As <persName corresp="#p_OO_1">Obasanjo</persName> seemed unaware of
                            the increase in number of active US firms in past year, I told him he
                            would be seeing early evidence of greater US activity in the Nigerian
                            market. At the same time, I could not deny there were problems. I cited
                            the kinds of factors that American businessmen examine when deciding
                            where to expend scarce financial and manpower resources. I noted such
                            items as costs of rental or purchase of office space and residential
                            buildings, access to communications facilities (telephone, telex, etc.),
                            ability to move around the city and the countryside, clarity and extent
                            of indigenization requirements, general climate for expatriates,
                            availability of strong local partners, and efficiency of host government
                            bureaucracy. I said that on some of the cited points Nigerian scored
                            high, on others less so. I said that the Embassy had an active program
                            of assisting and counseling American companies interested in the
                            Nigerian market regarding how best to approach and evaluate these
                            various factors, and I assured the Head of State that <gloss
                                target="#t_FMG_1">FMG</gloss> offices and other Nigerians were
                            engaged in similar and collaborative efforts with US. In particular we
                            often found that we had to urge patience on American companies who
                            sometimes <pb n="62" facs="0094" xml:id="pg_62"/>thought they could
                            strike “the quick deal.” These various efforts were achieving a stronger
                            US business presence in Nigeria.</p>
                        <p>3. I also cited the importance of the business and commercial grapevine
                            in the US which I said could sometimes exaggerate the complications of
                            doing business in Lagos. If a major company thought it had suffered a
                            bad experience it might reverberate around the corporate boardrooms and
                            business luncheon circuits in ways that would discourage other American
                            companies from taking a careful and serious look at Nigerian market
                            possibilities. As an example, I cited C–E Tec and its experience with
                            the military barracks construction project.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_OO_1">Obasanjo</persName> said he understood the
                            effects of the sorts of problems I had mentioned and hoped we could work
                            together to alleviate them. As for C–E Tec, he said “they presented us
                            with an impossibly expensive deal—besides, they are getting a good
                            project in the east.” I said I was not privy to the details of the
                            military barracks negotiation and its breakdown but I thought that
                            better communication and more patience on both sides might have produced
                            better understanding and avoided the possibility that C–E Tec’s
                            experience might discourage others. (As for the C–E Tec project in
                            Anambra and Imo states, we understand it was terminated in its early
                            stages.)</p>
                        <p>5. I asked about the long-awaited program of incentives for foreign oil
                            producers. <persName corresp="#p_OO_1">Obasanjo</persName> said it would
                            be announced soon.</p>
                        <p>6. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YA_1">Young</persName> mentioned his
                            long-time interest in a Nigerian-American joint consultative commission
                            and asked whether something along such lines might be timely. <persName
                                corresp="#p_OO_1">Obasanjo</persName> said he thought yes and asked
                                <persName corresp="#p_GJN_1">Garba</persName> whether the <gloss
                                target="#t_FMG_1">FMG</gloss> had not already studied the matter.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GJN_1">Garba</persName> referred to the
                            several conversations he and I had had on this subject over the past
                            eighteen months and said his office had received materials from us for
                            review and discussion with other departments of the government.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GJN_1">Garba</persName> told <persName
                                corresp="#p_OO_1">Obasanjo</persName> that the <gloss
                                target="#t_FMG_1">FMG</gloss> would pick up this matter again with
                            the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>. I cautioned that the
                            experience we had had with other such commissions indicated that they
                            were most useful when tailored to specific needs and interests of each
                            side. Even then, the demands that the commission infrastructure puts on
                            high-level officials of both governments are heavy. I suggested that
                            careful exploration of such a proposal would be necessary prior to
                            raising the possible merits of the proposal to decision-making levels in
                            each government. Obsanjo agreed, and instructed <persName
                                corresp="#p_GJN_1">Garba</persName> to undertake such explorations
                            with me.<note n="4" xml:id="d20fn4">Bilateral discussions took place in

                        <p>1138. Subject: Soviet Military Activity in Mali—a French View.</p>
                        <p>1. <gloss target="#t_DCM_1">DCM</gloss> and Embassy’s Defense Attache
                            (resident in Dakar) called March 21 on French Military Attache in
                            Bamako, Lt. Col. Claude Maquin, to discuss Soviet military activity in
                            Mali. Maquin said Malians placed priority on developing their Air Force.
                            There are about 80 Malians now training in Soviet Union,<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d21fn2">An unknown hand bracketed this sentence and the
                                previous one in the right margin and underlined “80 Malians now
                                training in Soviet Union.”</note> including pilots, radar
                            technicians, maintenance specialists, and runway repair technicians. In
                            short, said Maquin, Malians were developing needed infrastructure to
                            support an Air Force, or, he added, a Soviet Air Force presence.</p>
                        <p>2. Maquin had heard rumors of Soviet activity in Adrar des Iforas section
                            in remote Sixth Region near Algerian border. There were natural air
                            strips in that area that could be used, although the logistic problems
                            would be enormous. Area is barren rock and desert populated sparsely by
                            nomadic tribesmen.</p>
                        <p>3. Soviets were also providing equipment and training in armor and
                            artillery, but the tanks were World War II relics—about 30 <gloss
                                target="#t_T34_1">T–34</gloss>’s. Maquin said he had not heard of
                            any T–62 model tanks in Mali. Maquin had counted six additional <gloss
                                target="#t_T34_1">T–34</gloss>’s delivered to Mali via Guinea in
                            late 1976.</p>
                        <p>4. Maquin noted that Malians had, by Sahelian standards, a respectable
                            military force. Even the old tanks represented impressive firepower
                            against other African countries. Yet, said Maquin, the Malians lacked
                            the logistic facilities to go much beyond their own borders. Senegal and
                            Ivory Coast would only have to cut the railroad and the roads leading to
                            Mali and Malian Armed Forces would be cut off. Perhaps in the far
                            distant future Soviet logistic support—from the north—might be enough to
                            carry Mali against its coastal neighbors, but that was farfetched.
                            Maquin doubted that the Malians had any territorial designs on their
                            neighbors.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>The Boeing Vertol Company has informed us that the Nigerian Air Force
                            wishes to purchase seven Chinook helicopters (<gloss target="#t_CH47C_1"
                                >CH–47C</gloss>’s). Since this prospective sale could change the
                            nature of our military supply relationship with Nigeria, I am informing
                            you about it at this early stage to obtain your views.</p>
                        <p>The total sale could amount to about $40 million. If approved, it would
                            represent the first sale on a Foreign Military Sales (<gloss
                                target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss>) basis of U.S. military equipment to
                            Nigeria since the Nigerian civil war. (The Nigerians already have six
                                <gloss target="#t_C130_1">C–130</gloss> transport planes, but these
                            were purchased commercially, not through <gloss target="#t_FMS_1"
                                >FMS</gloss>.) Boeing representatives have informed us that the
                            Nigerian Federal Military Government (<gloss target="#t_FMG_1"
                                >FMG</gloss>) would like to send a 5–7 man team to the United States
                            the week of April 17 to visit the Boeing production facility and U.S.
                            Army installations to inspect and see CH–47 helicopters demonstrated.
                            State Department permission would be required for a visit to the Boeing
                            factory because it is a defense plant. Defense Department clearance is
                            required to visit U.S. Army installations.</p>
                        <p>Our Ambassador to Nigeria strongly favors the sale of Chinooks, but he
                            and Boeing are concerned that the Nigerians not be allowed to proceed
                            too far if there is any chance the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                            would turn down a subsequent request for a <gloss target="#t_FMS_1"
                                >FMS</gloss> Letter of Offer and Acceptance. Boeing has requested an
                            advisory opinion on whether we would issue an export license.</p>
                        <p>Although your election and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YA_1"
                                >Young</persName>’s trip to Nigeria have already strengthened our
                            bilateral relations,<note n="2" xml:id="d22fn2">See <ref target="#d20"
                                    >Document 20</ref>.</note> we have an interest in further links
                            to the <gloss target="#t_FMG_1">FMG</gloss>. The <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>’s decision not to sell spare parts and
                            ammunition during the Nigerian civil war was a basic reason for the
                            decline in our relations. A Nigerian decision to proceed with the
                            Chinook purchase could contribute to the further improvement of
                            US-Nigerian relations.</p>
                        <p><pb n="65" facs="0097" xml:id="pg_65"/>With respect to arms transfer
                            policy concerns, the Chinook is a heavy-lift helicopter which would
                            improve the mobility of the Nigerian armed forces and would also be
                            available for non-military roles such as civic action and infrastructure
                            projects. It is unarmed, and we have sold non-lethal equipment to
                            Nigeria in the past. For these reasons, Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_YA_1">Young</persName> supports this sale. It cannot be
                            air transported (except by the very largest cargo aircraft) and has
                            limited range, so that it is unlikely to be used outside the immediate
                            environs of Nigeria. Nigeria is already militarily much stronger than
                            its neighbors, but this has not raised concerns among them. However, a
                            Chinook sale could lead to further sales inquiries from the Nigerians.
                            They have already expressed interest in possible purchases of <gloss
                                target="#t_C130_1">C–130</gloss> and F–5E aircraft, artillery, air
                            defense radar, and other military equipment.</p>
                        <p>While the visit of the Nigerian team does not require Congressional
                            notification, it may eventually lead to a sale which would require
                            submission to Congress. Under section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control
                            Act, as amended, any Letter of Offer to sell major defense equipment
                            valued at $7 million or more must be submitted to Congress for review
                            and possible rejection by concurrent resolution.</p>

                        <p>The Soviets are engaged in airport modernization in Mali. They have
                            already lengthened the strip at Mopti to 3000 meters and are doing the
                            same at Bamako. Another airstrip is also being worked on.</p>
                        <p>This program is logical enough from the Malian point of view; they have
                            received a few MIGs from the Soviets and the lengthened runways will
                            accommodate these. The related early warning radars and navigation aids
                            are also logical.</p>
                        <p>More disturbing from our point of view is the capability of these strips
                            to handle large Soviet transports of the type (<gloss target="#t_AN22_1"
                                >AN–22</gloss>) that would be used to support possible military
                            operations in Southern Africa. The Soviets made some limited use of
                            Mali’s fields during the Angolan operation; the improved fields would be
                            much more attractive to the Soviets and they would probably feel that
                            they had good grounds for demanding their use, either as an alternative
                            to Conakry or in addition to it. (The route from Algeria to Central
                            Africa is much shorter via Mopti than via Conakry—see map.)<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d23fn2">Not attached.</note></p>
                        <p>We do not know of any agreement providing for Soviet use of these fields
                            but should find out if any exists. We probably do not have much legal
                            ground for arguing against Soviet use but we might consider exploring
                            ways of averting a problem before it arises:</p>
                        <p>—Our own influence in Mali is limited. Before anything else is done,
                            however, State and Embassy Bamako should explore the possible usefulness
                            of a direct approach. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BPM_1"
                                >Byrne</persName> is anxious to have subjects to raise with her host
                            government; she could be briefed on our view of the Soviet role in
                            Africa or some similar topic and lead the conversation to our concern
                            over Soviet military involvement in the continent.<note n="3"

                        <p>—The French have residual influence in Mali; they could be asked to
                            convey their concern that Mali not become a staging area for Soviet
                            activities in Central and Southern Africa.</p>
                        <p><pb n="67" facs="0099" xml:id="pg_67"/>—Most useful might be approaches
                            by other Africans (Ivory Coast, Nigeria, Ghana, Zaire) along the same
                            lines. We could inspire these.</p>
                        <p>Whoever makes the approaches they would obviously have to be cast in
                            general terms—e.g., on the undesirability of great power military
                            involvement in Africa. Mali is not guilty of anything and perhaps has no
                            intention of obliging the Soviets in this regard. Still, it might be
                            useful to remind them gently.</p>

                        </opener>
                        <p>Attached is a memorandum<note n="2" xml:id="d24fn2">Not printed.</note>
                            in response to your query about Soviet activity in Mali and how it might
                            be countered.<note n="3" xml:id="d24fn3">Not found.</note></p>
                        <p>The paper in general concludes that the Soviet airfield construction
                            program will enhance the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>’s
                            capability to provide air logistical support for military operations in
                            Angola or southern Africa. The significant increase in Soviet military
                            assistance to Mali over the past year, particularly in aircraft sales
                            and airfield construction, would tend to ensure some type of Soviet
                            access to Mali’s airfields.</p>
                        <p>In view of Mali’s current reliance on Soviet military aid, and the mutual
                            interest of these two governments in supporting liberation movements in
                            southern Africa, it appears doubtful that Mali would be responsive to a
                            Western suggestion to deny the Soviets access to these facilities
                            without a very positive Western offer of military assistance.</p>
                        <p>If you have additional questions on this subject, please let us know.</p>

                        <p>Your memorandum of June 6, 1977, raised several questions concerning the
                            Soviet airfield improvement program in Mali.<note n="2" xml:id="d25fn2"
                                >Not found. An undated and unsigned memorandum to the Secretary of

                                    Document 23</ref>) raises these questions.</note> When the
                            program is completed, a number of these strips will be able to
                            accommodate large Soviet transports such as the <gloss
                                target="#t_AN22_1">AN–22</gloss>. Whether a formal agreement exists
                            for Soviet use of these fields is of minor significance, as Mali is
                            solidly committed to support “wars of liberation” against
                            white-controlled regimes in southern Africa. Were the Soviets to request
                            permission to use these fields to support possible military operations
                            in southern Africa, it immediately would be granted by the Malians.</p>
                        <p>Because of Mali’s landlocked position, the improved airfields do not
                            offer the same advantages as enjoyed by the Soviets in Guinea or
                            Somalia. For example, if they wished to stage <gloss target="#t_TU95_1"
                                >TU–95</gloss> reconnaissance flights from Mali, the Soviets would
                            need to obtain overflight clearances from the neighboring African
                            countries. Additionally, it would be much more expensive to fuel and
                            support aircraft in Mali, than at airfields like Conakry and Cotonou
                            along the coast.</p>
                        <p>The airfield improvement program is of direct benefit to Mali and has
                            non-military significance as well. It will strengthen considerably
                            Mali’s internal air transport capability and will make possible direct
                            flights from the country’s major agricultural areas to Europe by
                            civilian freighters. The Malians eventually hope to export by air, major
                            quantities of fruits, vegetables, and chilled meat to the European
                            market.</p>
                        <p>The strength of Mali’s commitment to the liberation of southern Africa is
                            such that neither a direct approach by the U.S., nor influence through
                            the French or Mali’s African neighbors would cause her to deny the
                            Soviets use of the improved airfields in the support of operations in
                            southern Africa. Indeed, Soviet flights in support of the liberation of
                            southern Africa probably would be welcome in certain other West <pb

                            shall, however, raise the matter with the Embassy in Bamako and request
                            its advice regarding possible ways to bring our concern to the Malian

                            Guinea and his delegation of three Guinean Cabinet members. The meeting
                            was extremely positive in tone. The Prime Minister, speaking for
                            President <persName corresp="#p_TAS_1">Sekou Toure</persName>,
                            emphasized:</p>
                        <quote><p>—the friendship Guinea feels for the U.S.;</p>
                            <p>—Guinea’s desire to move ahead with economic, cultural, educational

                                will deepen our relationship and strengthen our friendship;</p>
                            <p>—Guinea’s full appreciation for your Administration’s Africa policy.
                                The Prime Minister said with satisfaction that the Guineans see your
                                policy as a certainty and they are impressed with the far-seeing
                                nature of your views.</p>
                            <p>—He said we would see Guinea’s appreciation reflected in the
                                positions it takes during the current <gloss target="#t_OAU_1"

                        <p>The Prime Minister confirmed that Guinea has put an end to the presence
                            of Soviet long-range reconnaissance Bear aircraft which have <pb n="70"

                        <p>The Prime Minister said that President <persName corresp="#p_TAS_1">Sekou
                                Toure</persName> and Guinea share fully your views on human
                            rights—views which they see as the moral and social foundation for your
                            policy in Africa. The Prime Minister confirmed, as he had said to
                            Warren, that Guinea would be pleased to have a U.S. delegation visit his
                            country to look into the human rights situation there.</p>
                        <p>Emphasizing his desire to be candid, the Prime Minister said that Guinea
                            would be most appreciative if we could make available six coast guard
                            cutters to help his nation protect its coast (however, he did not link
                            this to the termination of the Bear flights). Of significance, he said
                            that while weapons are important, Guinea attaches great importance to
                            its economic, industrial, agricultural and educational cooperation with
                            the U.S.</p>
                        <p>On these requests for assistance, I told the Prime Minister that I knew
                            the State Department was giving consideration to his government’s
                            request for the cutters. I said that we were pleased to consider
                            Guinea’s request for cooperation in the fields he had identified, and I
                            noted that our Ambassador—who was present at the meeting—had taken
                            careful note of the specific points made by the Prime Minister.</p>
                        <p>In concluding, the Prime Minister emphasized again that Guinea views the
                            U.S. as a friend. He said that it is his country’s greatest wish to
                            receive a visit at the highest level from your Administration. He said
                            President <persName corresp="#p_TAS_1">Sekou Toure</persName> hoped that
                            you would accept his invitation to come to Guinea, but if you preferred,
                                <persName corresp="#p_TAS_1">Sekou Toure</persName> would come to
                            the U.S.; that if you could not make the visit they would be delighted
                            to have me come; and if I could not, they would be delighted to have
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VC_1">Vance</persName> come.</p>
                        <p>I told the Prime Minister I would convey his message and his invitation
                            to you, and I said we looked forward to exploring ways to increase our
                            cooperation.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister Beavogui’s message could not have been more positive.
                            Given the problems we have had with Guinea in the past, <persName
                                corresp="#p_TAS_1">Sekou Toure</persName>’s decision to end the Bear
                            flights is both positive and significant. I believe it would be very

                        <p>1. Not having received the relevant background papers mentioned in <gloss

                            responding. In any event, before answering the Department’s three
                            questions, I shall briefly recapitulate some general comments on the
                            Soviet-Malian relationship as reported from this Embassy. The Department

                                conclusion that while the Soviets would like to improve their

                        <p><pb n="72" facs="0104" xml:id="pg_72"/>2. Mali perceives itself as
                            independent and non-aligned, acting in its own interests and no one
                            else’s. It seeks economic development aid from the West and military
                            assistance from the Soviets. The military government considers an
                            effective armed force essential to its image and to Mali’s security, and
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> is the only source willing to
                            provide the required equipment. Mali believes itself free of outside
                            influence and is confident of its ability to handle any unwanted
                            pressures.</p>
                        <p>3. With respect to airfields, the Soviets have been undertaking
                            significant improvements of the runways at Sikasso, San, Mopti, and Gao,
                            ostensibly for Mali’s <gloss target="#t_MIG21_1">MIG–21</gloss>’s but
                            actually also for Soviet aircraft, just in case. Mali is strategically
                            important to the Soviets because in the vast belt above the 11th
                            parallel, only Mali would offer landing facilities to them on their way
                            south. Gao is much closer to Algiers than is Guinea, and so for certain
                            aircraft it could be a better staging area. These airfields are probably
                            not intended as anything more than back-up or emergency landing
                            places.</p>
                        <p>4. Whereas the Soviet intent in improving Mali’s runways would seem
                            clearly to be to prepare for contingencies in connection with any
                            designs in Southern Africa, Mali’s purposes are different. For Mali such
                            Soviet activity is seen as upgrading its basic infrastructure in a way
                            no other power is willing to do. Equally important, if an airlift were
                            needed to bring majority rule to Southern Africa, Mali could offer its
                            airfields as refueling or staging areas as its contribution to the
                            common effort.</p>
                        <p>5. Mali does not want a violent solution in Southern Africa because of
                            the attendant suffering and the diversion of energies from the goal of
                            economic development. But it remains skeptical of negotiations, and if
                            nothing comes of them and armed struggle were viewed as the only way to
                            “liberate” Southern Africa, Mali would do its part through its
                            airfields. At the time of Soviet use of Bamako-Senou for the airlift to
                            Angola in late 1975, Director General of Foreign Affairs <persName
                                corresp="#p_TAS_1">Halidou Toure</persName> told the French
                            Ambassador that Mali “would ally itself with the devil” if it would help
                            the Southern Africa cause. Actually, the Malians, who unequivocally
                            backed the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>, were convinced that
                            the Soviets and the Cubans were “pure” in their motivation and had no
                            designs in Angola of their own. That consideration was important to the
                            Malian perception, for <persName corresp="#p_TAS_1">Toure</persName>
                            also said at the time (and to me later) that Mali would not want to do
                            anything to further an outside power’s ambitions on the continent.</p>
                        <p>6. To turn to the Department’s questions, we know of no specific
                            agreement giving the Soviets use of the airfields improved by them, and
                            the French are quite certain there is none. There may, however, be
                            verbal promises or even an informal letter. General arrangements <pb
                                n="73" facs="0105" xml:id="pg_73"/>concerning Soviet assistance
                            concluded under the Modibo Keita regime apparently still exist but are
                            highly secret, and it is said that virtually no one, even among Malian
                            officials, knows what is in them. In any case, the form of any agreement
                            or lack thereof would not be important if the situation met the Military
                            Committee’s criteria for assistance to Southern Africa.</p>
                        <p>7. A demarche to express concern over possible future Soviet use of
                            Mali’s airfields to support operations elsewhere in Africa would be, in
                            a word, unacceptable to the Malians. The Department will recall the
                            Foreign Ministry’s reaction of controlled anger when Chargé Dawkins
                            delivered a diplomatic note expressing the <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss>’s concern over the Angola airlift on December 24, 1975
                            (75 Bamako 4730).<note n="7" xml:id="d27fn7">In telegram 4730 from

                                note protesting Malian support for the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1"

                                Foreign Policy File, P850081–1639)</note> It will also remember
                            Ambassador McGuire’s message some two months later reporting that the
                            Government of Mali came close to refusing to receive the December
                            demarche and that our bilateral relations had suffered from it (76
                            Bamako 0591).<note n="8" xml:id="d27fn8">In telegram 591 from Bamako,
                                February 17, 1976, the Embassy reported that the U.S. démarche to
                                Mali on the use of Bamako airport by Soviet aircraft returning from
                                Angola was badly received. (National Archives, RG 59, Central

                            would have no chance of success.</p>
                        <p>8. The French Ambassador considers that an approach to Mali by France,
                            still the single most influential power here, would be as badly received
                            as one by us and would perhaps be even less acceptable.</p>
                        <p>9. The West African defense arrangement under the <gloss
                                target="#t_CEAO_1">CEAO</gloss> framework offers the possibility of
                            important moderating influences on Mali, and we are pleased that Mali
                            has been folded in. The Africans, however, are themselves enough
                            concerned about Soviet activity in Africa to undertake the requisite
                            steps with Mali without Western prodding. I would therefore recommend
                            that we let the Africans pursue their own courses with Mali in their own
                            effective way.</p>
                        <p>10. Fundamentally, Mali’s reaction to any future Soviet request to use
                            its airfields and air space for operations elsewhere in Africa will
                            depend on the circumstances prevailing at the time and on how the
                            request is presented. If it is cleverly couched in terms of “liberating”
                            Southern Africa, Mali would respond affirmatively. If the situation were
                            not clear, however, and Mali perceived an element of Soviet self-serving
                            or power politics, its reply might not be so easily predicted. The
                            Western effort at negotiated solutions is critical, both in the hope <pb

                        <p>Prime Minister Beavogui’s visit was a Guinean initiative to improve
                            strained relations with the United States. We should respond in a
                            positive but discreet manner, to each of the major points Guinea raised,
                            while paying due regard to the sensibilities of Guinea’s moderate
                            neighbors and to <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> policy
                            considerations, including human rights and arms transfer restraint.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Background:</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_TAS_1">Sekou Toure</persName> decided to send
                            Beavogui to the United States for several reasons:</p>
                        <p>—Guinean relations with the U.S. had been strained by Guinea’s decision
                            to allow Soviet reconnaisance flights from Conakry to resume on
                            September 23, the day after we signed an agreement to provide 10,000
                            tons of <gloss target="#t_PL_1">PL</gloss>–480 rice. Guinea earlier
                            offered to stop the flights, but had requested a U.S. security
                            guarantee. We replied that we would study the guarantee request while
                            agreeing to the request for rice. The sequence of events clearly
                            indicated Guinean duplicity and we suspended implementation of the
                                <gloss target="#t_PL_1">PL</gloss>–480 agreement until last May.</p>

                            role, and the interest of U.S. Steel in Guinean iron ore, have raised
                            the Guinean government’s hopes for more private U.S. investment.</p>
                        <p>—<persName corresp="#p_TAS_1">Sekou Toure</persName> recognizes that the
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> administration’s
                            emphasis on human rights raises additional problems in bilateral
                            relations with the U.S.</p>
                        <p>—<persName corresp="#p_TAS_1">Sekou Toure</persName> wished to lessen
                            Guinean dependence on the Soviets.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Results:</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister gave two major undertakings in his meetings with the
                            two of us: he announced that the deployment of Soviet intelligence
                            aircraft from Conakry had been stopped, and that Guinea was prepared to
                            accept a delegation in Conakry to examine the human rights situation.
                            The only specific request he made was to obtain six “coast guard
                            cutters,” although in his meeting with you he also alluded to “economic,
                            cultural, educational and industrial development programs.”</p>
                        <p>The request for “coast guard cutters” was not expressly stated as a <hi
                                rend="italic">quid pro quo</hi> for termination of the intelligence
                            flights. Guinea, however, has contended that the Soviet flights were
                            tolerated because they provided occasional defensive surveillance of the
                            Guinean coast. The implication was that the “cutters” could serve this
                            purpose among others.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_TAS_1">Sekou Toure</persName> is aware of the
                            inconsistencies between Guinea’s professions of support for the rights
                            of man and the practices of his government. Available evidence suggests
                            that the Guinean government does not hesitate to take harsh repressive
                            measures against real or imagined opponents. These measures include
                            prolonged detention without charge, and torture to extract confessions.
                            Resort to these measures reached its height following the abortive
                            Portuguese invasion of 1970. Since then the pattern has been uneven but
                            marked by occasional purges. <persName corresp="#p_TAS_1"

                            documented international criticism, such as the report of the

                        <p><pb n="76" facs="0108" xml:id="pg_76"/>Guinea’s first line of defense
                            against criticism has been a determined attempt to justify Guinea’s

                            Guinea’s underlying respect for human rights. <persName

                            its authors as agents of western intelligence services. This has been
                            his standard reaction to criticism of his country’s human rights record.
                            However, it is possible that Guinea is prepared to improve its human
                            rights situation for tangible benefits, particularly aid and
                            investment.</p>

                        <p>We propose a prompt and constructive response as follows:</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Termination of the Soviet Flights:</hi> We shall
                            continue to note that this has removed a major obstacle to improvement
                            of our bilateral relations. The Soviets are still deploying intelligence
                            flights to Africa and may pressure the Guineans to allow them to refuel
                            and transit Conakry in route to Angola. We shall avoid linking the
                            termination to any specific <hi rend="italic">quid pro quo</hi> on our
                            part, but will attempt to strengthen Guinean resolve by responding
                            promptly and constructively to the latest request for <gloss
                                target="#t_PL_1">PL</gloss>–480 commodities, implying that our
                            response stems from their willingness to continue to deny the Soviet
                            flights.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Offer to Receive Human Rights Delegation:</hi> It is
                            not clear how Guinea would respond to a proposal to send a
                            delegation—whether it would be allowed to interview specific prisoners
                            and visit detention sites for example. To test Guinea’s intentions we
                            shall seek to inspire a proposal from an international body with a
                            recognized interest in human rights, such as the International Committee
                            for the Red Cross, (which is widely known for its impartiality and great
                            discretion) and urge Guinea to accept. This would be far preferable to
                            sending a delegation identified solely with the U.S. Government or a
                            U.S. private organization. We should be alert to any Guinean efforts to
                            influence the composition of the delegation. If the <gloss
                                target="#t_ILHR_1">ILHR</gloss> complaint is forwarded to the U.N.
                            Human Rights Commission we would be prepared, consistent with our
                            announced policy on such complaints, to support a thorough study or
                            investigation.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Request for “Coast Guard Cutters”:</hi> While we do not
                            know why Guinea requested cutters, or precisely what they have in mind,
                            all but the smallest U.S. made patrol or rescue craft are on the
                            munitions list. Thus the Guinean request raises problems under the arms
                            transfer policy.</p>
                        <p>The President’s arms transfer policy describes arms transfers as an
                            exceptional foreign policy tool. The Foreign Assistance Act contemplates
                            that arms sales and financing for such sales will not be made to
                            countries with poor records of human rights observance unless the <pb
                                n="77" facs="0109" xml:id="pg_77"/>Secretary of State concludes that
                            such assistance is in our national interest. Our security assistance
                            presentations to Congress have never given any indication of possible
                            military sales to Guinea, let alone U.S. funds to finance such sales.
                            There is considerable unease in Congress about U.S. military sales to
                            Africa and reprogramming of Foreign Military Sales (<gloss
                                target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss>) funds. We believe an <gloss
                                target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> sale to Guinea might be justified if
                            it could be shown that it occurred in a context of improved Guinea
                            performance on human rights and would provide an incentive for further
                            human rights improvements by easing Guinea’s fears—whether justified or
                            not—regarding its security. The sale, by removing the only justification
                            Guinea has ever advanced for the Soviet intelligence flights, could also
                            remove Guinea as an important link in the Soviet ocean surveillance
                            system.</p>
                        <p>Under the circumstances we shall postpone a final decision on the
                            provision of “cutters” to Guinea until a) we can assess their
                            willingness to receive a human rights delegation, b) we have had an
                            opportunity to consult the Congress and c) we have a clear idea of their
                            requirements.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary began by welcoming the Liberians.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_DCC_1">Dennis</persName> replied by saying
                            that he was grateful for the opportunity to meet the Secretary on short
                            notice and in advance of the scheduled appointment. He said <hi

                            elected Vice President of Liberia on the 4th of October, and thus had to
                            return to Liberia September 30.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary offered his congratulations in advance to Bishop <persName
                                corresp="#p_WBD_1">Warner</persName>.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DCC_1">Dennis</persName> said that he had
                            particularly wished the Bishop to meet the Secretary, and to see that

                        <p>The Secretary replied that after his exposure to the <gloss

                            or two.</p>

                            on his first few months in office, to which the Secretary replied that
                            he was getting used to it after eight months.</p>
                        <p>Bishop <persName corresp="#p_WBD_1">Warner</persName> said that he had
                            watched the Secretary on television during the <hi rend="italic">Panama
                                Canal Treaty</hi> hearings, and that he had rooted for the Secretary
                            like a football fan.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that he had been before the Senate Foreign
                            Relations Committee for four hours, and in the end had been obliged <pb

                            cable to President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>
                            congratulating the latter on the achievement of the Panama Canal

                            <persName corresp="#p_DCC_1">Dennis</persName> continued that he wished
                            to say how much Liberia appreciated the <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                >Carter</persName> Administration. President <persName
                                corresp="#p_TWR_1">Tolbert</persName>, he said, never lost an

                                >Carter</persName> on <hi rend="italic">US African policy</hi>. The
                            Liberian Government thought that an eloquent way of manifesting US
                            interest in Africa was to visit the continent. President <persName
                                corresp="#p_TWR_1">Tolbert</persName> was overjoyed by the prospect
                            of President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>’s visit to
                                Africa.<note n="4" xml:id="d29fn4">President <persName

                            <persName corresp="#p_DCC_1">Dennis</persName> continued by saying that
                            the US is closely identified with Liberia. Liberia has tried hard to
                            encourage the US to take an intelligent interest in Africa. Now Liberia
                            can only congratulate the US on the success of its ventures in Rhodesia
                            and elsewhere. <persName corresp="#p_DCC_1">Dennis</persName> said the
                            US has the wholehearted support of Liberia.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said the US Government appreciates the whole-hearted
                            support of Liberia and, in particular, the President appreciates the
                            support which came from President <persName corresp="#p_TWR_1"
                                >Tolbert</persName> even before his Administration began.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DCC_1">Dennis</persName> said that they regretted
                            President <persName corresp="#p_TWR_1">Tolbert</persName> could not come
                            to the General Assembly. They had received a message through the Embassy
                            in Monrovia to the effect that President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                >Carter</persName> was prepared to receive President <persName
                                corresp="#p_TWR_1">Tolbert</persName> in New York if the latter
                            could be there around October 4. Unfortunately, Bishop <persName
                                corresp="#p_WBD_1">Warner</persName>’s election prevented President
                                <persName corresp="#p_TWR_1">Tolbert</persName> from leaving
                            Liberia.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DCC_1">Dennis</persName> continued by saying that
                            he would be honest. Liberia appreciated the assistance the US has given,
                            but all Liberians wished to know the answer to the question “Where does
                            the US stand with regard to Liberia, given the <hi rend="italic">special
                                relationship?</hi>”. Senegal and Ivory Coast, to name two of
                            Liberia’s neighbors, have a special relationship to France. Liberia was
                            a beacon, a torch, lit in Africa by the United States. Until recently,
                            Liberia was the only independent republic on the continent. Now, the
                                <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> has 49 members. They have
                            followed the example of Liberia. Liberia has paid a price for this. It
                            has been regarded as a tool of the US. Liberia has tolerated this
                            implied criticism, indeed on occa<pb n="80" facs="0112" xml:id="pg_80"
                            />sion has been more Catholic than the Pope, and supported US interests
                            as strongly as any American. Given this close relationship, the friends
                            of the US in Liberia wished to know where the US stood.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DCC_1">Dennis</persName> emphasized that he was not
                            talking about the possibility of a visit by President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> to Liberia, although Liberia
                            knows where President Giscard of France would go if he made a visit to
                            Africa.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he would speak simply. It was true that there is a
                            special relationship with Liberia based on history, shared aspirations,
                            and shared views. Among the important values we share are a belief in
                            human rights. What must be done now is to work closely together to make
                            sure that our hopes and aspirations can be realized. We must stay next
                            to each other in the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>. We must be
                            aware of the economic aspects of the special relationship. The Secretary
                            commented that he understood that US economic assistance to Liberia had
                            been greater than US assistance to any other country but one in the
                            African area. The question arose, should it be larger? The Secretary
                            said we would be willing to talk about it, in order to respond to
                            Liberia’s requirements.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he regretted it was not possible for the President to
                            stop in Monrovia during his trip. There simply was not enough time. In
                            the interest of the special relationship there should be increased
                            discussion of issues, particularly African issues, with Liberia. The US
                            needs to understand better Liberia’s point of view.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DCC_1">Dennis</persName> thanked the Secretary for
                            his explanation. He noted that the system Liberia advocated had been
                            inherited from the United States, and that Liberia believed in it. But,
                            he said, to sustain the system we shall require more of the things we
                            are talking about. <persName corresp="#p_DCC_1">Dennis</persName> said
                            he was heartened by the way the Secretary felt about it, and commented
                            that, among other things, a new yardstick was needed to measure US
                            assistance, a yardstick more effective than <hi rend="italic">per
                                capita</hi> aid. Liberia knows that a friend in need is a friend
                            indeed.</p>
                        <p>Bishop <persName corresp="#p_WBD_1">Warner</persName> said he wished to
                            express his appreciation for taking the Secretary’s time. He had
                            benefitted from the broad perspective of the Secretary’s views of the
                            world. He understood that the Secretary kept a Bible in his office and
                            had been heartened by that news.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary congratulated the Bishop and said that he looked forward to

                            note from Ambassador Harmon, said that in 1979 Monrovia would be the
                            venue for the meeting of the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>. He
                            said that as Liberia prepares for this meeting it would share some of
                            its problems with the US.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary concluded by saying that in the meantime the US would be
                            grateful for the support of Liberia, particularly with regard <pb n="81"
                                facs="0113" xml:id="pg_81"/>to southern Africa. The problems were
                            important. The repercussions of success or failure would be
                            worldwide.</p>

                                of Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_VC_1">Cyrus

                                1977.</note> Our discussion centered on the forthcoming negotiations
                            by Lord Carver and General Chand to determine arrangements for the
                            transition period of Rhodesia. In addition, I summarized the present
                            state of negotiations for a Middle East settlement, progress toward a
                                <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> agreement, and the US
                            position on the principal North/South economic issues.</p>
                        <p>The most significant aspect of our conversation was a remarkably frank
                            exchange of views regarding the difficulties which we anticipate in
                            dealing with Joshua Nkomo and Robert Mugabe. We pointed out that Nkomo
                            in particular may, possibly with Soviet backing, hold out for
                            arrangements which would make peacekeeping unworkable or cast doubt on
                            the integrity of the election procedure. <persName corresp="#p_OO_1"
                                >Obasanjo</persName> urged us to see that the negotiations are
                            conducted in Africa—not elsewhere as David Owen and Nkomo have
                            suggested—and said that we must stay in close contact with the Front
                            Line and Nigeria. He promised, in so many words, that if Carver and Prem
                            Chand come up with a workable arrangement which Nkomo or Mugabe reject,
                            the Front Line and Nigeria would “take care of them” as well as, by
                            implication, any objections which the Russians or Chinese might raise in
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>I emphasized our desire for an early report to the Security Council and a
                            recommendation regarding a <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                            peacekeeping force. General <persName corresp="#p_OO_1"
                                >Obasanjo</persName> underlined the importance of defining the
                            responsibilities of <pb n="82" facs="0114" xml:id="pg_82"/>the Resident
                            Commissioner, and the eventual <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                            Commander, for administering Rhodesia during the transition, for
                            maintaining law and order and for training a new professional Zimbabwe
                            army. In response to our question, <persName corresp="#p_OO_1"
                                >Obasanjo</persName> said he would not object if a Nigerian were
                            appointed <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> force commander or deputy
                            commander. He urged, in great confidence, that we use our influence to
                            see that Nigeria is entrusted with responsibility for training the new
                            army which, in his words he said “must be loyal to Zimbabwe and not to
                            any political figure.” This army, he said, would be the key to what is
                            his greatest concern, i.e., post-independence stability.</p>
                        <p>Overall, on Rhodesia, we agreed (a) to work to get the Resident
                            Commissioner and Prem Chand in motion as quickly as possible; (b) to
                            urge that the negotiations take place in Africa with a wide variety of
                            parties; (c) to seek a report to the Security Council on security
                            arrangements as soon as possible; and (d) that in themselves these
                            accomplishments would hasten the departure of <persName

                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_OO_1">Obasanjo</persName> had no
                            substantive questions following my summary of the Middle East and <gloss
                                target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>. During our discussion of
                            international economic issues, he expressed a desire for an experts’
                            meeting in Washington or Lagos to deal with outstanding bilateral and
                            multilateral economic issues. He noted that this meeting could lead to
                            the establishment of some form of a US/Nigerian economic commission and
                            said that he expects to discuss this subject tomorrow. Dick Cooper
                            summarized our opposition on oil prices but the General did not
                            comment.</p>

                            present its reprocessing for use in explosives. We have been pushing to
                            get agreement on this point among the relevant countries. We are
                            concerned, and we have been monitoring South Africa from our satellites,
                            to try to prevent further cooperation between South Africa and other
                            potential nuclear powers. We hope to prevent the emergence of additional
                            nuclear nations while moving towards the development of peaceful uses of
                            nuclear power.</p>

                            participate in the nuclear suppliers conference. France and Germany who

                            preventing its use for explosives. I feel strongly on this issue, and I

                            How much success have you had with France and Germany?</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President:</hi> We have had some success. Early in
                            my Administration, I made the mistake of pursuing this question too much
                            in public. We have some progress with Brazil. The French have doubts
                            about Pakistan commitments in that deal. The French have publicly agreed
                            not to sell reprocessing plants to any <hi rend="italic">other</hi>
                            countries. If they can back out without being seen to capitulate to the
                            United States, I believe they would do so. A year ago there was a
                            feeling that nothing can be done on non-proliferation. Now, that feeling
                            is reversed. I will be urging Brazil to reconsider on this matter; they
                            are angry with me for entering into “an internal matter”; they were on
                            the verge of being competitive in this area.</p>
                        <p>In the upcoming (nuclear suppliers) meeting, I will meet with the
                            delegates. This will probably be a meeting of technicians, designed to
                            educate the world on this subject. For example, what is uranium, what
                            are the processes by which it is enriched, the nuclear waste problem,
                            peaceful nuclear power, some analysis of the fuel cycle. The Soviets and
                            others need to know the necessity for restraint. There is a growing <pb

                            Demonstrations have occurred against nuclear power plants in the United
                            States and in Germany. I think that if properly built, the plants can be
                            safe, but there is strong public feeling on this question. Increasingly
                            this is a world problem: it relates to national energy supplies, and it
                            relates to <gloss target="#t_OPEC_1">OPEC</gloss>.</p>

                            the two countries. We probably have an advantage in miniaturization,
                            solid propellants, and in numbers of warheads. The Soviets generally
                            have liquid-fueled missiles and larger warheads.</p>

                            Gromyko was here, and the Soviet Union seems to be acting responsibly. I

                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President:</hi> Three years ago the Soviet Union
                            and Egypt were aligned. That relationship was broken by Egypt. There are
                            currently good relations between the US and Egypt. Of all the parties in
                            the Middle East, Egypt is probably the most cooperative, both publicly
                            and in private; Sadat has frequently extended offers to help. Relative
                            to military power, Egypt offers Israel the most problems. Sadat is
                            having serious economic problems. A breakdown in negotiations would be
                            attributed to his lack as a political leader, and his offer of
                            friendship towards Israel would be perceived as spurned. The Syrians are
                            more difficult; they are afraid of a unilateral Egyptian move. I
                            personally like Assad and Assam, however.</p>
                        <p>Israel has been the most difficult, but lately more cooperative. They
                            have agreed to move towards Geneva and towards <gloss target="#t_PLO_1"
                                >PLO</gloss> representation there. They are now being more
                            forthcoming in private. Egypt is the most cooperative, and feels a great
                            need for peace in the area. The easiest negotiations might be between
                            Egypt and Israel. We are putting enormous economic and arms aid into
                            Egypt and Israel.</p>

                            reduction of weapons would assist the economies of both countries.
                            Israel especially has a high rate of inflation.</p>

                            more, and I will not betray that trust. I am interested in a Golan
                            Heights settlement, and willing to pressure Israel to this end, but it
                            is difficult. We will just have to listen and work these problems
                            through. Cy and I have spent an enormous amount of time doing so. All

                            That a new party must have unanimous consent to join the Conference,
                            presents problems. Lebanon’s joining is a good step; the <gloss

                            There is much pressure on Israel on the West Bank settlement issue.
                            Israeli acts on the West Bank may be in accord with the Geneva Covenant.
                            We are making progress and we must, because everyone knows that the

                            is generally that if a territorial compromise was possible, it should be
                            explored. The British wish for Belize to retain territory down to the
                            Mohoh River and west from there to Guatemala. They are also exploring
                            initial compensation along with a settlement. We are now awaiting word
                            from the British, and we have urged the Guatemalans not to take any
                            precipitate actions.</p>
                        <p>I have also talked to the Guatemalan Foreign Minister in New York.
                            Historically, Guatemala thinks that Belize is part of Guatemala, but
                            think that some small territorial cession might be necessary. We would
                            like to minimize this. The area in the South is basically unpopulated,
                            and some compensation for pipeline rights might be possible. The United
                            States has been publicly quiet on this issue. There is a general
                            international feeling that Belize should be independent. We have been
                            urging fairness throughout the whole process.</p>

                            There would seem to be an analogy to the Ogaden here. And there is some
                            fear in the Commonwealth of violating the principle of territorial
                            integrity.</p>

                            at the same time, and that there was no rationale for the French

                            independence. The Mayotte plebiscite came out two to one against the

                            investment arrangements. I hope we can establish an exchange on this
                            matter between ourselves. I cannot force US business to do what they do
                            not want to do, and I wish you to understand that. I also wish to report
                            their concerns about the stability of the climate in which they are
                            going to invest; for example, with respect to non-retroactive laws. I
                            believe that substantial US investment in Nigeria is to our mutual
                            advantage. Perhaps we could establish a joint trade commission or a
                            seminar for US businessmen in Lagos to “have it out” on these issues. I
                            would hate for this to create a problem between us. There is no imminent
                            difficulty, but US businessmen need to understand your laws and your
                            customs, for example, your labor situation and your regulations on
                            indigenization.</p>

                            We briefly touched on this yesterday. Perhaps a seminar and a joint
                            commission would be possible.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_GJN_1">Garba</persName>:</hi> I

                            recommend something similar to General <persName corresp="#p_OO_1"

                            That probably will satisfy the situation. We are fashioning economic
                            progress and allowing investment and government participation. I believe
                            that Nigeria’s atmosphere allows for a satisfactory return on
                            investment. Relative to indigenization, there are three areas or sectors
                            for Nigerian investment relative to the percentage which should be
                            reserved for Nigerian participation: for example, trading, and
                            distribution. In the distribution area we allow foreign participation up
                            to 40 percent. In other areas we allow foreign participation of up to 60
                            percent. In some cases, there has been a deliberate misinterpretation of
                            our policy. When we said Nigerians must participate up to 60 percent in
                            banks and insurance companies, American banks and insurance companies
                            decided to stay. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_EDB_1"
                                >Easum</persName> tells me that they are happy. One, I believe, did
                            decide to go, but I predict they will return.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_EDB_1">Easum</persName>:</hi> The

                            on good terms.</p>

                            moderate. We seek to fulfill our national aspirations without losing
                            sight of the need for investment. I speak only for the present
                            government, obviously, but I don’t see expropriation by a future
                            Nigerian government. Nigerians are too sensible and realistic to pursue
                            such a policy. Our proposed discussion and seminar will serve an
                            educational function in this respect. When we promulgated our
                            indigenization program, we spoke with the ambassadors from the
                            industrialized countries. This dissipated some initial misunderstanding.
                            There is always the possibility of distortion unless one is actually
                            on-the-spot to see how these policies work. Perhaps a seminar in the
                            United States to serve a similar educational function might be
                            possible.</p>

                            On behalf of the Nigerian people and myself and my delegation, I wish to
                            extend our sincere appreciation to you for this opportunity to examine
                            issues of concern and importance to both Africa <pb n="91" facs="0123"
                                xml:id="pg_91"/>and the world. We are <hi rend="italic">most</hi>
                                (<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>) impressed by the frank and cordial
                            discussions which we have had. This is a new chapter in US–Nigerian
                            relations. We will do all possible to continue to build on this firm
                            foundation. We hope that skeptics and cynics will not be given the
                            opportunity to say that they were right. We do still have a long way to
                            go to concretize certain of these issues to our mutual advantage, and to
                            the advantage of Africa and the world. I particularly appreciate the
                            confidence that you repose in us and in me. We solemnly say that we will
                            not betray that confidence—you have opened yourself to us. We will take
                            advantage of this exposure in the best spirit.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President:</hi> Those are indeed my feelings. We
                            feel that we can depend absolutely on your integrity, and this is a
                            mirror of the faith that Africa has reposed in you to act fairly. If
                            there is any situation in the future that demands it, I hope that we
                            would directly communicate with each other to escape any major
                            difficulties. I hope that the small differences that we are bound to
                            have can coexist within our friendship. I am honored to have all of you
                            and look forward to visiting you again in Lagos.</p>

                            Namibia, we agreed to put the Five Power proposals before the Security
                            Council on April 10. The United States is prepared to publicly state to
                                <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss> that the issue of Walvis
                            Bay can be negotiated subsequent to a settlement, and to further state
                            our view that the results of these negotiations should be that Walvis
                            Bay will wind up as a part of Namibia. The Front Line undertook to get
                            in touch with <persName corresp="#p_NSD_1">Sam Nujoma</persName> and
                            discuss his concurrence with the proposal.</p>
                        <p>Relative to Zimbabwe, we agree on a meeting with the Patriotic Front
                            called by the United States and Britain. This would be followed by an
                            all-parties conference. We are working on the final details today. Our
                            preference is for the site of such a conference to be somewhere in
                            Africa. The United States will be in touch with all the parties.</p>

                            made the point that the circle of contact on Zimbabwe should be

                            asked specifically whether the Patriotic Front had agreed to attend an
                            all-parties meeting. We were assured without doubt that they did agree
                            on this.</p>

                            am not sure about the position that we have agreed on Walvis Bay.</p>

                            What will be the South African reaction?</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_VC_1">VANCE</persName>:</hi> I
                            believe that they will understand, but Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_MDF_1">McHenry</persName> can better speak to that.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_MDF_1">MCHENRY</persName>:</hi>
                            They will probably understand but will not like it. They have agreed
                            that all Walvis Bay questions can be negotiated. The language that we
                            have proposed meets their minimum conditions: it respects their legal
                            position and it calls for negotiations.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">THE PRESIDENT:</hi> This may result in an agreement by
                            an independent Namibia to let the South Africans use their port
                            facilities. If we raised this question in any other way, we would get
                            bogged down.</p>

                            We must move quickly on Zimbabwe and Namibia.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">THE PRESIDENT:</hi> I agree; this could be a headache
                            for us and we would not want it to drag on.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_VC_1">VANCE</persName>:</hi> I
                            have informed David Owen in response to a message which he sent last
                            night that I will participate in a meeting with the Patriotic Front,
                            probably in Dar-es-Salaam.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_OO_1">OBASANJO</persName>:</hi>
                            On South Africa, we would like to know what other “arm twisting
                            measures” the United States will bring to bear towards changing
                            apartheid.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">THE PRESIDENT:</hi> South Africa desires several
                            things. They desire to be respected and accepted as part of the
                            international community and not to be a pariah. We have joined in the
                            arms embargo against them. Our own business firms have initiated
                            standards for their activities in South Africa related to bettering
                            conditions of their South African employees. The United States has less
                            capital investment in South Africa than other countries like Britain and
                            France who have a large South African trade. Many African nations have
                            massive trade with South Africa, such as Mozambique. Over time, the
                            United Nations will probably act further; we will be acting
                            independently as well.</p>
                        <p>It is impossible for us to totally sever our relationship with South
                            Africa and withdraw our investment from that country. It would be futile
                            and would violate United States law. I would not mislead you <pb n="96"
                                facs="0128" xml:id="pg_96"/>on this. The most effective pressure on
                            South Africa must come by concerted action with other nations.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_VC_1">VANCE</persName>:</hi> We
                            have been considering other economic actions against South Africa such
                            as cutting off <gloss target="#t_EXIM_1">EXIM</gloss> credits. I talked
                            recently with a member of the South African business community who told
                            me of the serious effects such a step would have. We are also exploring
                            other measures.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_YA_1">ANDY YOUNG</persName>:</hi>
                            There is much happening on this point apart from any action the United
                            States Government may take. My worry is that South Africa has a
                            self-sufficient economy. Unless sanctions are orchestrated carefully and
                            are in response to a crisis, we risk being overruled by Congress.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">THE PRESIDENT:</hi> We would also be violating U.S.
                            law.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_VC_1">VANCE</persName>:</hi> (In

                            to South Africa are declining and consist only of guarantees of
                            financing and insurance.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">THE PRESIDENT:</hi> We have had bad experience on
                            embargoes in the Middle East. The South African economy may be
                            self-sufficient. <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> has
                            indicated he wants to see me; I have said that I will when he is ready
                            to settle Namibia and move seriously on Zimbabwe. If we act in concert
                            we will be more effective. South Africa is the key economic nation in
                            southern Africa. As South Africa changes to majority rule, it can
                            continue to be a central economic force in the region.</p>

                            We can talk about further measures when the crisis comes.</p>

                            time to time.</p>

                            believe we have finished Africa.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">THE PRESIDENT:</hi> I will be glad to brief you on
                            other issues. In the Middle East we are heavily involved, perhaps too
                            much so, transmitting messages between Israel and Egypt and other
                            states. We are committed to support Israel’s right to exist, and we have
                            generally good relations with other nations in the area. Sadat’s visit
                            was a major step towards peace, but the Israeli response was not equal
                            to it. The Israeli’s have taken certain measures, but Begin is stuck on
                            three points and these are an obstacle to peace:</p>
                        <p>1. He is unwilling to accept that Resolution 242<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d33fn3"><gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Security Council
                                Resolution 242 was adopted on November 22, 1967, in the aftermath of
                                the war between Israel and the surrounding Arab states. The
                                resolution addressed the issues of boundaries and refugees in the
                                region and aimed to end the state of belligerency between Israel on
                                one hand, and Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt on the other.</note>
                            applies to the West Bank.</p>
                        <p><pb n="97" facs="0129" xml:id="pg_97"/>2. He is unwilling to give
                            Palestinian Arabs a voice on their own future—either to affiliate with
                            Jordan or some international affiliation.</p>
                        <p>3. He has refused to stop creating new settlements or to halt the
                            expansion of old settlements.</p>
                        <p>I think he is wrong on all three points. We have gone as far as possible
                            by ourselves. Begin is in a strong position in Israel, but there is
                            strong dissension in the Israeli Government. Begin will not change
                            unless his advisors and other government leaders change their minds on
                            these issues. He is a stubborn man.</p>
                        <p>Sadat can hold out against pressure for a limited time only. We have
                            convinced him to give it a few weeks longer to let world opinion work to
                            put pressure on Israel. We feel it is in Israel’s best interests to have
                            friendly relations with its Arab neighbors. The situation in the Middle
                            East is a dangerous one and could lead to a serious war, and I do not
                            know quite what will happen. With the Soviet Union, we are making good
                            progress on the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> talks.
                            Notwithstanding news reports, there has been no interruption in these
                            talks. We are also talking with them on holding down weapons sales,
                            peace in the Indian Ocean, and preventing attacks on each other’s
                            satellites.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_OO_1">OBASANJO</persName>:</hi>
                            Possibly Africa figures in your discussions with the Soviet Union?</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">THE PRESIDENT:</hi> Yes. Their intrusion in Africa is a
                            serious problem. We have encouraged them to reduce their arms supply and
                            not to use the Cubans. The Soviets claim that they are acting to uphold
                            self-determination of African countries, but we understand that the
                            Cubans will soon make a major push in Eritrea. Our belief, and we hope

                            they are reluctant to leave, as with both Ethiopia and Angola. They
                            claim they have no influence over Cuba, which is only a peaceful country

                            You previously asked me how we operated. We have Ministries headed by
                            Commissioners. The administrative boss in the Ministry is the Permanent
                            Secretary, who is not as permanent as is implied. (Laughter.)</p>
                        <p>He is a career man and starts from the middle of the ladder and works his
                            way up to the top. If he has been correctly trained in the army he is
                            ready after coming up the ladder to offer good advice to government. We
                            have other committees and so forth, and we have 22 Ministries. (Names
                            the Ministries.)</p>

                        <p>There is a cabinet office through which everything comes from the
                            ministries through to the government. There is a body there which
                            coordinates the economic ministries. There is also a Permanent Secretary
                            for Services Affairs, for Political Activities, and for External
                            Affairs. Petroleum used to be a ministry but now it is a corporation in
                            order to more easily operate in the commercial market. We have a
                            Committee for Economic Development responsible for initiating and

                            we agreed that we would set up meetings on the official level to discuss
                            outstanding problems in the context of the encouragement of, and the

                            good progress. We are currently well underway in scheduling the working
                            groups to meet with us in the United States in the spring.</p>

                            in May?</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_EDB_1">EASUM</persName>:</hi>
                            That would perhaps be the case.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">THE PRESIDENT:</hi> If there is a lack of progress
                            here, I wish that you will communicate with me directly and I will
                            attempt to resolve it. I will do what I can in this respect not only
                            relative to our government but also on approaches to private
                            industry.</p>
                        <p>Ours is a free enterprise system, and the government has very little to
                            do with where investors choose to invest. Unintentionally, small
                            obstacles may have arisen in your country that are preventing US
                            investors from coming in. I believe it would be possible for Ford Motor
                            Company, makers of blue jeans and other goods to all invest here. We
                            have no quarrel with the laws and rules for investment which you
                            establish. The difficulty which worries investors is the uncertainty and
                                <pb n="99" facs="0131" xml:id="pg_99"/>unpredictability of these
                            rules. If investors could count on such rules, for example, with respect
                            to indigenization, not changing over the next five years, their
                            willingness to invest would increase. Your country has been blessed by
                            oil, but that will not last forever and will have to be replaced by
                            manufacturing and development. We are eager to expand our cooperation
                            and trade with you. If difficulties arise in this process please get in
                            touch with me directly and I will see what I can do to resolve them.
                            Since we do have different systems we may not be able to resolve all of
                            them completely, but we will try.</p>

                            will take that. I understood that in Washington D.C. the officials of
                            our two governments were not clear about some of the conditions “on the
                            ground,” (i.e., in Nigeria). On that basis we would perhaps prefer that
                            the next meeting of the working groups would be here.</p>

                            There are both advantages and disadvantages in Lagos and Washington.
                            Perhaps <persName corresp="#p_HR_1">Robert Hormats</persName> who
                            chaired our team at the last meeting could comment further.</p>

                            Our idea in inviting the working groups to Washington was to give them
                            some direct exposure to the U.S. Government agencies relevant to meeting
                            Nigeria’s needs and to the private firms which might be involved. We had
                            hoped that a small group could have come over earlier in the year, but
                            that unfortunately had to be cancelled. Now we hope that they can come
                            at the end of April. Much work has been done to make their visit a

                            relative to successive changes in laws such as your indigenization
                            decree.</p>

                        <p>We have taken all of these measures with a serious sense of
                            responsibility, because we do not choose to isolate ourselves from the
                            world and therefore know that cooperation must continue. We have divided
                            our enterprises into three groups: (1) those where little expertise or
                            capital is required; (2) those where medium expertise and capital is
                            required. (In these Nigerians are required to own 60 percent and
                            foreigners 40 percent); (3) those where very heavy expertise and
                            capital, for instance relative to transfer of technology, are required.
                            For these foreigners may own 60 percent and Nigerians are required to
                            own 40 percent.</p>
                        <p>In all seriousness we do not intend to change this. On the question of
                            whether a future administration may change these provisions, we believe
                            there is no cause for fear. We have been acting responsibly and we have
                            no intention of expropriating anyone’s business. Even if “radicals” took
                            over the government tomorrow, we are taking measures <pb n="101"
                                facs="0133" xml:id="pg_101"/>to prevent expropriations from
                            occurring. If I can illustrate on the level of dividends, we are
                            fighting both externally imposed inflation and internally generated
                            inflation. It is not an easy fight. We have recently allowed a little
                            more for dividends to give us flexibility in fighting inflation. We have
                            also moved large firms into group number three. This goes well with

                            Chase Manhattan’s decision to leave Nigeria), who said that he had not
                            regretted his bank’s stay here. Our policies are deliberate, but they
                            should not hurt investments. On this basis I would ask, can the United
                            States do something to generate or to underpin private sector confidence
                            relative to investment in Nigeria?</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">THE PRESIDENT:</hi> I believe that my visit will help
                            in this respect. When we return, I can report to my Cabinet on your

                            now underway. Cy and Bob (<persName corresp="#p_HR_1"
                            >Hormats</persName>), could you prepare a report on this so that I can
                            explain the importance of the visit of the Nigerian team and our
                            economic relationship?</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_OPIC_1">OPIC</gloss> is also very important here. I

                            guarantees. Some businessmen who are dynamic are sometimes impulsive;
                            they are often frustrated at the slow process of <gloss

                        <p>Let me raise another question. We are being discriminated against as an

                        <p><hi rend="italic">THE PRESIDENT:</hi> Unfortunately, it is probably not
                            possible to change this situation now. <gloss target="#t_GSP_1"

                            countries. Congress will not now reconsider this law. President Perez of
                            Venezuela made it a point to bring the same matter to my attention in
                            Caracas. I wish that the law was not there. However, I believe that the
                            adverse impact on Nigeria is slight.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_OO_1">OBASANJO</persName>:</hi>
                            That may be the case, but this is a symbolic thing; however, I
                            understand.</p>
                        <p>Also, we used to have a block grant agreement. Concessional aid for
                            participant training of Nigerians in the US and salary supplementation
                            of US experts in Nigeria. Can this be updated?</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_EDB_1">EASUM</persName>:</hi>
                            There is about $1 million left under this agreement which we were
                            planning to use to top up experts’ salaries for work in Nigeria.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_OO_1">OBASANJO</persName>:</hi> I
                            am aware of the $1 million; I was asking whether additional monies would
                            be possible.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_EDB_1">EASUM</persName>:</hi> My
                            understanding is that there are no specific gross national product
                            criteria under the relevent <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>
                            legislation. But we need to know the specifics of how you would propose
                            that concessional aid be used. On that basis we can go to Congress. This
                            matter can be developed further in the working groups.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">THE PRESIDENT:</hi> Most of these agreements go to
                            low-income countries. In this connection there is another possibility
                            for assistance, but we do not insist on it. Peace Corps is an avenue of
                            aid for high <pb n="103" facs="0135" xml:id="pg_103"/>income countries.
                            I know it has a bad history here. Perhaps a few volunteers could be sent
                            on a trial basis, but we are not insisting on this.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_OO_1">OBASANJO</persName>:</hi>
                            We need older, mature people. They could perhaps be sent over under a
                            technical assistance program but not as Peace Corps, because we still
                            have political problems here. But it could be done as technical
                            assistance, and this may work, especially in agriculture.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">THE PRESIDENT:</hi> If you could list the specialties
                            which you need that Peace Corps volunteers might be able to fill, we
                            could work on it in the way that you suggest. I have a somewhat
                            different view of Peace Corps than you do; my mother went to India in
                            the Peace Corps when she was 68. I don’t know about problems in the
                            past, but I do know about the future. Sending the Peace Corps here is
                            not an issue for us and I only propose it as another way to help you. If
                            you don’t want it, forget it. Possibly retired people with expertise
                            could be worked into this program.</p>

                                    corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> visited Monrovia April 3.
                                In telegram 2506 from Monrovia, April 5, the Embassy transmitted the
                                highlights of a Liberian government memorandum analyzing
                                U.S.-Liberian relations. (National Archives, RG 59, Central Foreign
                                Policy File, D780147–0349)</note></p>
                        <p>1. As participants will recall, a number of sidebar conversations ensued
                            during course of Monday, 3 April working luncheon but bilateral
                            discussions in which most of US participated could be broken down into
                            three categories: agriculture, health and security.</p>
                        <p>2. Under agriculture, President <persName corresp="#p_TWR_1"
                                >Tolbert</persName> and Minister Phillips discussed Liberia’s
                            interest in support for treecrop development designed to increase
                            production of palm oil, coffee and cocoa. There was general discussion
                            on this subject in which President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                >Carter</persName> also participated, utilizing his specialized
                            knowledge of ground nuts, but no decisions or recommendations were
                            taken. It was noted that U.S. is already somewhat involved in the palm
                            oil industry in Liberia and questions from the <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> side stressed Liberia’s plans for small farmer
                            inclusion.</p>
                        <p>3. Under discussion on health the exchanges concentrated on river
                            blindness, a disease described by President <persName corresp="#p_TWR_1"
                                >Tolbert</persName> as affecting at least half the population in
                            certain rural subdivisions of the country. <persName corresp="#p_TWR_1"
                                >Tolbert</persName> and Minister of Justice (formerly Health
                            Minister) Oliver Bright asked that U.S. consider support for a regional
                            research center on onchocerciasis. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VC_1"
                                >Vance</persName> pointed out that <gloss target="#t_USAID_1"
                                >USAID</gloss> is already doing some work on the subject, that we
                            would undertake to determine whether Liberia could be included in the
                            regional program already established.</p>
                        <p>4. The discussion under security flowed from President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>’s observation that the <gloss

                                corresp="#p_TWR_1">Tolbert</persName> lamented the small allocation
                            in the FY–79 budget and said yes, that the <gloss target="#t_GOL_1"
                                >GOL</gloss> did anticipate “an additional ship or two” by 1981 to
                            help in policing its waters. <persName corresp="#p_TWR_1"
                                >Tolbert</persName> and Minister of Defense Burleigh Holder claimed
                            that the Soviets were raping Liberia’s waters of valuable fish.
                            President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> related <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>’s experience with the Soviets and
                            acknowledged that the situation was not improved until several vessels
                            and their captains were brought to stateside ports and courts. President
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> expressed interest in
                                <gloss target="#t_GOL_1">GOL</gloss>’s request for patrol equipment
                            and asked that the situation be reviewed by (and here I am uncertain)
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VC_1">Vance</persName> or <gloss

                                to multiple posts, April 8, the Department asked for local

                        <p>5. Embassy rapporteur suffers somewhat in fulfilling his assignment
                            because he could not join the various sub-groupings around the table.
                            This problem is additionally compounded by the fact that substantive
                            exchanges occurred between <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> and
                                <gloss target="#t_GOL_1">GOL</gloss> principals riding to and from

                        <p>6. Minister Townsend told Ambassador that Presidents <persName

                            in from the airport. Townsend said <persName corresp="#p_TWR_1"
                                >Tolbert</persName> revealed that he had called in the Soviet
                            Ambassador at the time the <gloss target="#t_GOL_1">GOL</gloss> was
                            throwing out the TASS correspondent for interference in internal
                            Liberian affairs and warned the Ambassador that any similar involvements
                            would result in the Ambassador’s being asked to leave. <persName

                            />The Soviets are prudent and flexible but quickly move into a vacuum.
                            Angola was such a case because of American hesitation following Vietnam.
                            France and other countries needed to trade with Angola and pressed
                            Senegal to recognize it. They even spoke of personal danger to Senghor.
                            Senghor told them that this was a dangerous tactic and that Zambia or
                            Zaire could be next. The Soviets are attempting to carry out the legacy
                            of both Lenin and Peter the Great. They want to conquer Africa first and
                            then Europe. By that time it might be too late for the United States to
                            react. They rely on non-African helpers such as Cuba and the <gloss

                            as Algeria, Libya, Benin, Congo Brazzaville, Madagascar, Ethiopia and
                            Guinea although in Guinea American actions have improved the

                            Egypt, Tunisia and Senegal on the other hand are going to establish a
                            social democratic union at the end of June.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">President Senghor</hi> pointed to one split in Africa
                            between Arabs and Negroes. Algeria and Libya are playing on this.
                            Senegal is on the dividing line and has removed both tribalism and
                            religious wars. A more important split is the cultural one between
                            Francophones and Anglophones. Senegal is combatting this by developing
                            bi-lingualism.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">President Senghor</hi> said that the worst split in
                            Africa is between “progressives” and moderates. The progressives,
                            supported by the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and Eastern
                            Europeans, seek to destabilize areas that they do not control. The
                                <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> refuses to accept an East-West
                            split in Africa and condemns intervention. Algeria however opposes
                            Morocco and Mauritania and has intervened in Mali and Niger. They and
                            the Libyans are interfering in the Western Sahara, and want to split all
                            of these states to gain control of the Arab populations. Hardly five
                            percent of the people in the Sahara however are pure Arabs.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">President Senghor</hi> said the first thing we should
                            do is to ensure compliance with Article III which prohibits
                                intervention.<note n="4" xml:id="d35fn4">Article III of the Charter
                                of the Organization of African Unity affirms the sovereignty and

                            at the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>, Senegal sponsored a
                            Resolution condemning intervention, with Angola in mind. Algeria opposed
                            it but it was adopted 42 to 6 showing that there is no progressive

                            but this depended on Nigeria and he solicited US backing with Nigeria on

                        <p><hi rend="italic">President Senghor</hi> opposes an <gloss

                            remote from Zaire. Senegal does not want the US to send troops, but to
                            train and transport the forces of the regional pacts as they did in the
                            Kolwezi operation.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">President Senghor</hi> said that since only 10 of the
                            49 African countries are “progressives” we need not worry. The Cuban
                            role, as in Angola, shows that this is not the case. Senegal could have
                            refused to help in Zaire but then Chad and Mauritania would follow.
                            There would be a Soviet-Cuban thrust into central Africa, isolating the
                            moderates on the periphery.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">President Senghor</hi> said we are in a state of
                            confrontation of two ideologies. He and President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> are both democrats and believe
                            in human rights. President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                >Carter</persName>’s religion and stand on human rights, and defense
                            of democracy is important for Africa. America should help defend human
                            rights and freedom in Africa and help resist communism.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                    >Carter</persName></hi> thanked Senghor for his thorough and
                            enlightening presentation which helped to shape his thoughts. He said
                            that the American government is developing a willingness to play an
                            active role in Africa. We want strong independent states in Africa with
                            regional burden-sharing, no foreign intrusion, and efforts concentrated
                            on peaceful development. We cannot send military forces but look to
                            regional groupings or perhaps the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>
                            to deter intervention.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                    >Carter</persName></hi> said it is correct to emphasize that
                            countries such as Libya and Algeria who disrupt existing borders are
                            setting a dangerous precedent. America needs guidance from Senghor on
                            how to better handle African matters such as Zaire. We have had no
                            success in getting the Cubans out of Africa or keeping them from sending
                            more troops. We are therefore closely in tune with your advice and

                                    >Carter</persName></hi> referred to Africa’s several economic
                            problems and said that his Mother may visit the Sahel. This would
                            dramatize his <pb n="111" facs="0143" xml:id="pg_111"/>own personal
                            interest in these problems. America wants to help alleviate hunger and

                            Angola situation is correct. The Soviets came in while we were
                            traumatized by Vietnam. We will not make a similar mistake. We have not
                            recognized <persName corresp="#p_NAA_1">Neto</persName> but by law we
                            cannot get involved in Angola. <persName corresp="#p_NAA_1"
                                >Neto</persName> would be unable to stay in power without Cuban
                            support. We need to cooperate with you and other great African leaders.
                            There has been a substantial change in Congressional and public opinion
                            about opposing Soviets and Cubans and providing aid to those who help
                            themselves.</p>

                                >UN</gloss> and Senegal will contribute if necessary. Senghor
                            supports democracy in Namibia and Rhodesia and has told Nkomo and Mugabe
                            that there should not be an imposed regime like the <gloss

                        <p><hi rend="italic">President Senghor</hi> then raised the Arab-Israeli
                            question. He said he is part Jewish and can speak frankly to both sides.
                            At the time of the mandate both Jews and Palestinians lived together and
                            both deserve a homeland. There will be no durable peace until Jews live
                            among Arabs in a confederation. Begin is a fanatic but Senghor has
                            confidence in Sadat. He is trying to establish relations between the
                                <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> and Israeli Labor Party. He has
                            always found the <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> open and easy to
                            talk with, although the Christian Palestinians are more difficult.
                            Senghor said he <pb n="112" facs="0144" xml:id="pg_112"/>is at President

                                >Obasanjo</persName> agreed that the second round of US/Nigerian
                            bilateral economic talks should be held in Washington.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d36fn2">See <ref target="#d33">Document 33</ref>.</note> You
                            asked that we work with our Nigerian counterparts on a report for you
                            and General <persName corresp="#p_OO_1">Obasanjo</persName> to be ready
                            by the end of May. You suggested that these talks should focus on
                            opportunities for further progress in US/Nigeria economic relations and
                            on outstanding differences in the economic area. The meetings took place
                            on April 24–28. I attach the report agreed to by both delegations.<note
                                n="3" xml:id="d36fn3">Attachment not found.</note></p>
                        <p>Nigeria was represented by a high-level delegation consisting of three
                            permanent secretaries and a number of senior officials representing
                            virtually all major ministries in Lagos. The size, level and breadth of
                            agency coverage represented on the delegation evidenced the importance
                            attached by the Nigerian Government to US/Nigerian relations. The US
                            delegation comprised representatives from all agencies with a <pb
                                n="113" facs="0145" xml:id="pg_113"/>role in US/Nigerian economic
                            relations. Chaired by <persName corresp="#p_HR_1">Bob
                            Hormats</persName>, it included <persName corresp="#p_EDB_1">Don

                        <p>As you and General <persName corresp="#p_OO_1">Obasanjo</persName> said
                            they should, the conferees carefully examined the numerous possibilities
                            for closer US/Nigerian economic ties and frankly assessed current
                            impediments to such ties, e.g. the Nigerian investment climate. In
                            accordance with your wishes, we sought to establish contacts between the
                            Nigerian delegation and the US private sector. Three of the five days
                            were spent by the group visiting other parts of the US in order to meet
                            with various elements of the US private sector, especially potential
                            investors and research institutions with an interest in Nigeria.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">SIGNIFICANCE</p>
                        <p>This second round of US-Nigerian bilateral economic talks was significant
                            for several reasons:</p>
                        <p>—They continued the discussion of bilateral economic problems, and the
                            possibilities for further cooperation, which had been begun in the first
                            round in Lagos last November.<note n="4" xml:id="d36fn4">See <ref
                                    target="#d33fn4">footnote 4, Document 33</ref>.</note> There is
                            now an established framework in which we can continue to expand economic
                            contacts as well as raise pressing economic matters affecting our
                            bilateral relationship.</p>
                        <p>—We succeeded in putting on the record our views of virtually all of the
                            major issues between us.</p>
                        <p>These issues are chiefly in the trade and investment field. The most
                            important are the percentage of management personnel that may be
                            recruited outside Nigeria (“expatriate quotas”), the percentage of an
                            enterprise that must be Nigerian owned (“indigenization”), and the
                            amount of profit from investment that may be remitted.</p>
                        <p>The only significant issue that is not covered in the final report is the
                            denial of consular access to American citizens detained by the Nigerian
                            authorities. The Nigerian delegation contended that this is not purely
                            an economic issue and that we had not given them prior notice of our
                            intention to raise it in this context. They pointed out, correctly, that
                            no American businessman in the course of extensive discussions with the
                            private sector had raised the point. However, they agreed to inform
                            General <persName corresp="#p_OO_1">Obasanjo</persName> of our views and
                            I understand this has been done.</p>
                        <p>—The possibilities for further cooperation to develop the Nigerian
                            economy have been greatly enhanced. Two results are particularly
                            significant.</p>
                        <p><pb n="114" facs="0146" xml:id="pg_114"/>First, we agreed to fund several
                            missions to examine key aspects of the Nigerian economy in the clear
                            expectation that these missions will result in substantial reimbursable
                            development programs. These programs are facilitated by Section 607 of
                            the Foreign Assistance Act. Under this section, the Nigerian Government
                            may buy services from or through the US Government, as it is now doing
                            to provide training in the US for roughly a thousand Nigerian
                            technicians.</p>
                        <p>Second, the Nigerians made clear, for the first time, their desires for
                            “cost sharing” arrangements, i.e. concessional aid in the form of a
                            reduction in the price of the services they might purchase from us.</p>

                        <p>The four working groups focused on their special areas of interest:</p>

                            Corporation (<gloss target="#t_OPIC_1">OPIC</gloss>) and spent two days
                            in New York with investors, traders, shippers, and financiers,
                            discussing their interests and problems in doing business in
                            Nigeria.</p>
                        <p>—The Transfer of Technology Group met with a wide range of <gloss

                            services to the Federal Military Government, and traveled to Boston

                            presented me with a document entitled, “Briefing Notes and
                                Proposals.”<note n="2" xml:id="d37fn2">See <ref target="#d34"

                                thereto.</note> I read it with interest and have directed that your
                            suggestions be studied carefully. The various departments have now made
                            their reports and Ambassador Carter will be in touch with your ministers
                            to review your plans and the help which we can provide. We look forward
                            to cooperating with your government in the fields of development and
                            low-cost shelters in Monrovia. I also believe that we will be able to
                            help in the health area. I therefore propose sending <pb n="116"
                                facs="0148" xml:id="pg_116"/>a team to Liberia to determine how we
                            can help you combat river blindness.<note n="3" xml:id="d37fn3">In
                                telegram 1471 from Monrovia, February 23, 1980, the Embassy reported
                                on a meeting between Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare
                                Patricia Harris and <persName corresp="#p_TWR_1">Tolbert</persName>,
                                in which she assured the Liberian President that assistance on
                                combating river blindness was forthcoming once her office received
                                the team’s final report. (National Archives, RG 59, Central Foreign

                        <p>3. Although the subject was not raised in your memorandum, I have asked
                            our aeronautics and space administration to see whether our space
                            capability could be of benefit to Liberia. They have recommended to me
                            that we undertake a technical assessment of potential use of satellite
                            imagery in resource management and weather prediction. Ambassador Carter
                            is prepared to work with appropriate ministries in arranging such a
                            survey, if you are interested.</p>
                        <p>4. Most importantly, I would like to be responsive to the desires you
                            expressed to bring more of the benefits of development to all Liberians.
                            It seems to me that one of the best ways to do this is to provide a
                            greater opportunity for Liberians in all walks of life to acquire the
                            skills and knowledge that would permit them to improve their own
                            circumstances and, at the same time, participate more fully in the
                            development process.</p>
                        <p>5. Such an approach might be national in scope, and extend over several
                            years. It might aim at the improvement of the formal education system as
                            well as the establishment of training in specialized skills relevant to
                            the needs of Liberia’s people. It could include primary, secondary and
                            vocational and on-the-job training in the public and private sector.</p>
                        <p>6. National programs of this type have large monetary and political
                            costs, and require the sacrifice of certain other activities. But the
                            returns can be immense. We are interested in assisting in this area if
                            it is your wish, and if you are prepared to commit substantial resources
                            to the program.<note n="4" xml:id="d37fn4">In telegram 5129 from

                        <p>Commissioner Buhari described Nigeria’s planned <gloss target="#t_LNG_1"
                                >LNG</gloss> project. It will produce 1.6 to 1.7 billion cubic feet
                            (about 0.6 tcf per year) from six trains, all of which the Nigerians
                            hope to dedicate to the US. This 20 year project will require 13 tcf of
                            Nigeria’s 45 tcf of reserves. The Federal Government will own 85 percent
                            of the gas gathering facilities and 50 percent of the transportation
                            facilities; the companies involved in the project—Shell, <gloss
                                target="#t_BP_1">BP</gloss>, Phillips, <gloss target="#t_ELF_1"
                                >ELF</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_AGIP_1">AGIP</gloss>—will own the
                            remainder.</p>
                        <p>Buhari said the <gloss target="#t_LNG_1">LNG</gloss> project could come
                            on-stream 36 months after all regulatory approvals had been obtained. He
                            expressed concern about regulatory delays.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Schlesinger said we expect to have an <gloss target="#t_LNG_1"
                                >LNG</gloss> policy statement by September. Once the policy has been
                            established, he hoped evaluation of individual projects would not take
                            more than three or <pb n="119" facs="0151" xml:id="pg_119"/>four months
                            (following submission of a complete application). Nigeria could
                            hopefully get an answer in that time frame, though he could not say what
                            the answer would be. The Secretary advised the Nigerians not to equate
                            the timing of reviews on new applications with that required for earlier
                            projects. The applications for the El Paso II and the Tenneco projects
                            were filed before the <gloss target="#t_FPC_1">FPC</gloss>; its
                            stringent <hi rend="italic">ex parte</hi> procedures will hopefully not
                            apply to applications with <gloss target="#t_DOE_1">DOE</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>(FYI—Final procedures for processing <gloss target="#t_LNG_1">LNG</gloss>
                            import applications are still being negotiated between the Economic
                            Regulatory Administration (<gloss target="#t_ERA_1">ERA</gloss>) and the
                            Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (<gloss target="#t_FERC_1"
                                >FERC</gloss>). At this juncture, it appears that most major policy
                            aspects of specific <gloss target="#t_LNG_1">LNG</gloss> projects will
                            be reviewed by <gloss target="#t_ERA_1">ERA</gloss> with <gloss
                                target="#t_FERC_1">FERC</gloss> conducting a separate review on
                            siting and domestic marketing arrangements. While <gloss
                                target="#t_ERA_1">ERA</gloss> is generally subject to <gloss
                                target="#t_DOE_1">DOE</gloss> policy guidance, <gloss
                                target="#t_FERC_1">FERC</gloss> is not bound by such guidance. End
                            FYI)</p>
                        <p>Secretary Schlesinger said price will be an extremely important
                            consideration in the final decision on <gloss target="#t_LNG_1"
                                >LNG</gloss> contracts. He noted that the average price of US
                            natural gas is about $1.25 mcf; new gas is now selling for about $2.00
                            mcf; Canadian gas for $2.16 mcf; and Mexico has offered the US gas at
                            $2.60 mcf. Consequently <gloss target="#t_LNG_1">LNG</gloss> is a
                            relatively high cost gas, and we are uncertain about future demand for
                            it. We believe the natural gas legislation will stimulate development of
                            new domestic gas.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary suggested that Nigeria had two key factors in its favor.
                            First, a large portion of <gloss target="#t_LNG_1">LNG</gloss> cost is
                            the transportation charge and Nigeria is closer to the East coast market
                            than some other potential <gloss target="#t_LNG_1">LNG</gloss>
                            exporters. Second, the US wanted to diversify sources of supply, and
                            most <gloss target="#t_LNG_1">LNG</gloss> applications, either approved
                            or pending, involve Algerian <gloss target="#t_LNG_1">LNG</gloss> (1.6
                            tcf/yr)—which causes supply security concerns.</p>
                        <p>In response to Mr. Marinho’s questions on incremental vs. rolled-in
                            pricing and price indexing, the Secretary said that:</p>
                        <p>—The natural gas legislation requires limited incremental pricing for new
                            natural gas. We do not yet know how much of the burden of incremental
                            pricing would fall on <gloss target="#t_LNG_1">LNG</gloss>, but would
                            tend to look askance at fully rolled-in pricing for <gloss
                                target="#t_LNG_1">LNG</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>—We have already allowed some price indexing but only if the delivered
                            price is acceptable. We would likely not permit landed price of <gloss
                                target="#t_LNG_1">LNG</gloss> to reflect solely the <gloss
                                target="#t_OPEC_1">OPEC</gloss> price but we might find it
                            acceptable if the landed cost of <gloss target="#t_LNG_1">LNG</gloss>
                            was tied to the total cost of energy. The underlying objective of our
                            energy policy is to bring the full cost of energy to the consumers.</p>
                        <p>The Nigerians asked whether plans to use existing landing sites on the
                            East coast and the Gulf coast would adversely affect the decision <pb
                                n="120" facs="0152" xml:id="pg_120"/>on the Nigerian <gloss
                                target="#t_LNG_1">LNG</gloss> proposal. The Secretary assured them
                            that this factor would not be decisive.</p>
                        <p>Buhari told the Secretary that his discussion the day before at Treasury
                            had been useful. He explained Phillips’ concern that its 7.5 percent
                            equity in the <gloss target="#t_LNG_1">LNG</gloss> project would not
                            permit it to qualify for tax credits under IRS guidelines. Buhari
                            thought an acceptable solution would be to let Phillips have 10 percent
                            of voting control but receive only 7½ percent of the profits. He also
                            noted that Phillips is discussing buying additional equity from other
                            companies in the project.<note n="2" xml:id="d39fn2">For follow-up on

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Competitiveness of US Equipment Manufacturers</p>
                        <p>Buhari and Marinho said that the cost of the <gloss target="#t_LNG_1"
                                >LNG</gloss> project to the <gloss target="#t_FMG_1">FMG</gloss>
                            would be about $4 billion, 60 percent for equipment and 40 percent for
                            construction. While preferring US equipment and contractors, they said
                            European and Japanese offers were more competitive. For instance, they
                            said US Steel refused to bid on the pipelines for the project after
                            learning of Japanese competition. One US firm—Williams International—got
                            a small portion of the $4 billion contract and had exceeded Nigerian
                            expectations. Since this firm had used sub-contractors, the Nigerians
                            wondered why it had not been willing to take on a large share of the
                            total project. Marinho asked what might be done to make US companies
                            more competitive. He speculated that they entered a larger risk element
                            in their calculation than was justified. He also raised the question of
                                <gloss target="#t_EXIM_1">EXIM</gloss> financing.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Schlesinger said the US Government does not dictate commercial
                            policy to US companies and noted that the US market itself is invaded by
                            imported steel. He said unfortunately US firms tend not to be
                            export-oriented, but they must reassess earlier attitudes in view of the
                            US’s $30 billion trade deficit in 1977. The Secretary said we would look
                            into how companies calculate risks in dealing with Nigeria.</p>
                        <p>Regarding <gloss target="#t_EXIM_1">EXIM</gloss>, the Secretary said the
                            Bank’s objective was to encourage US exports; its loans were normally
                            tied to the purchase of US equipment. He noted that the Nigerians might
                            want to approach the World Bank, whose loans were not tied to purchases
                            of equipment from any particular country.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Oil</p>
                        <p>Commissioner Buhari explained the importance of US companies to the
                            Nigerian energy situation. The companies produced 700,000 b/d of oil.
                            With a total investment of $1.3 billion, they had invested $200 million
                            in Nigerian oil production in 1977. He expressed concern <pb n="121"
                                facs="0153" xml:id="pg_121"/>that the companies would reduce their
                            investments if they were subject to the IRS ruling that taxes based on
                            posted prices cannot be counted as tax credits. Noting that Treasury
                            would have to decide that matter, Secretary Schlesinger speculated that
                            the companies would probably figure out some way to meet the IRS
                            concerns and still protect their interests in Nigeria.</p>
                        <p>Buhari said the Nigerians needed help to accelerate the development of
                            new reserves. The cost of equipment, particularly for deep offshore
                            drilling, is escalating. Marinho interjected that US and other
                            industrialized countries’ firms appear to charge a surtax on equipment
                            sold to <gloss target="#t_OPEC_1">OPEC</gloss> countries. He said
                            Nigeria had documented that equipment sold to Ghana was priced lower
                            than the same equipment sold to Nigeria.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Schlesinger emphasized that there was no government policy to
                            charge <gloss target="#t_OPEC_1">OPEC</gloss> countries more than other
                            countries. He said we would investigate these charges if the Nigerians
                            would furnish us the data. It was agreed that the Nigerian Ambassador
                            would provide the information to Assistant Secretary Bergold.</p>

                        <p>In response to Commissioner Buhari’s query, Secretary Schlesinger said
                            new US energy legislation would not affect Nigerian exports
                            disproportionately. The effect of the new legislation on imports will be
                            slow. He expected US demand for imports to grow after the Alaskan oil
                            had been fully absorbed into the economy.</p>
                        <p>Marinho suggested that non-commercial factors were responsible for the
                            current slack in Nigerian oil sales. He claimed that even though Nigeria
                            had taken the necessary action to make its prices competitive on a
                            net-back basis with comparable crudes from other countries, its sales
                            were not recovering as rapidly as they should. Nigerian crude exports to
                            the US had declined from 58% to 50% of total exports. He said that Iran
                            seemed to be benefiting most from the Saudi decision to reduce exports
                            of light crudes.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Schlesinger stated that the US Government did not try to
                            influence companies as to their sources of supply. We have no allocation
                            system. However, he indicated that we would investigate if
                            non-commercial factors were causing aberrations in the market.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">US Strategic Reserves</p>
                        <p>In response to Marinho’s query, the Secretary made the following
                            points:</p>
                        <p>—We have ambitious plans for the creation of a 1 billion barrel strategic
                            storage reserve, which we will reach by 1983–84.</p>
                        <pb n="122" facs="0154" xml:id="pg_122"/>
                        <p>—We had hoped to have 250 million barrels a day in storage by the end of
                            the year. But the figure will be more like 125 million barrels. The
                            larger figure will not be achieved until June 1979.</p>
                        <p>—We are experiencing some difficulties (e.g., in citing permits from
                            states, disposing of obstacles from salt caverns), but we think all can
                            be overcome.</p>
                        <p>—By the end of October, we will have pipelines to the storage facilities,
                            permitting accelerated filling. Currently oil is moved to storage by
                            barges.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Future Direct Contacts</p>
                        <p>The Nigerians expressed a desire for direct line of contact with <gloss

                            responsibility to Assistant Secretary Bergold. The Embassy in Washington

                            Resigns.</p>
                        <p>1. At 2:30 p.m. today, Commissioner for Foreign Affairs R.J.A. Felli
                            announced to heads of all diplomatic missions, who had been summoned to
                            his office one hour before, that Chief of State and Chairman of the
                            Supreme Military Council General <persName corresp="#p_AIK_1">I.K.
                                Acheampong</persName> had resigned from office as of this morning.
                            Colonel Felli stated <persName corresp="#p_AIK_1">Acheampong</persName>,
                            who was “safe and well” had also asked to be retired from the armed
                            forces. The Supreme Military Council and National Redemption Council
                            were now in emergency session and further announcements would be
                            expected. He went on to say that there would be no fundamental changes
                            or major departures in Ghana’s foreign policy and asked that this word
                            be sent to the home governments of those present.</p>
                        <p>2. Comment: Announcement came as complete surprise to assembled chiefs of
                            diplomatic missions as no prior notice or even rumors of such a move had
                            circulated, city is calm. Announcement made on 3 p.m. Radio Ghana news
                            broadcast. Additional information will be forwarded as received.<note

                                corresp="#p_TAS_1">Toure</persName> made clear his interest in
                            cooperation with the US, set forth his dedication to independence,
                            dignity and self-respect, recounted Guinea’s struggle for independence
                            and survival despite attempts to overthrow his regime, described the
                            trauma of the 1970 invasion,<note n="2" xml:id="d41fn2">In November
                                1970, Portuguese soldiers and Guinean insurgents attacked Conakry,
                                intending to capture Amilcar Cabral, the leader of the independence
                                movement in Portuguese Guinea (now Guinea-Bissau) who was living in
                                Guinea, and overthrow Sékou Touré. The invaders freed some prisoners
                                and destroyed some infrastructure, but they retreated after they
                                could not find Cabral or Sékou Touré. Portugal denied involvement,
                                but a <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> mission determined that
                                Portugal had backed the invasion. The National Assembly of Guinea
                                sentenced 92 people to death on charges of treason for alleged

                            human rights, spoke of practical problems rights violations create with

                            on this issue, <persName corresp="#p_TAS_1">Toure</persName> spoke of
                            the strong popular revulsion against traitors and asserted the question
                            of their release is a matter for <gloss target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss>
                            alone to decide. <persName corresp="#p_TAS_1">Toure</persName>’s
                            half-brother Ismael pointed out that the President had not said the
                            prisoner releases would not continue and that we might draw our own
                            conclusions from that fact. <persName corresp="#p_TAS_1">Sekou
                                Toure</persName> agreed with that interpretation. The exchange was
                            an extremely useful one, enabling both sides to lay their principles and
                            concerns on the table, and clearing the way for greater understanding,
                            closer communications and perhaps cooperation on some African problems.

                        <p>3. Atmosphere of meeting was friendly, frank but serious from the outset.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TAS_1">Toure</persName> said he attached great
                            importance to the meeting, which he pointed out was the first with a
                            high-level <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> visitor to Guinea in
                            five or six years. Assembled group of some of his most important
                            ministers attested to significance he attached to meeting and at same
                            time put him on his mettle and may have robbed him of some flexibility.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TAS_1">Toure</persName> spoke in measured
                            tones, referring occasionally to notes, but increasing in conviction and
                            vehemence as he expanded on the essential spirit and goals of his regime
                            and the dangers that had threatened it over the past 20 years.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_TAS_1">A. Toure</persName> assured <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRM_1">Moose</persName> his wish for cooperation with
                            the US is total and sincere; he did not expect full agreement with
                            everything <gloss target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss> does but he wants us to
                            understand the spirit and principles that guide his government. He asked
                            that we judge Guinea by its acts, not what people say about it. He said
                            Guinea is not Communist nor a Communist puppet. He has had as much
                            trouble with the Soviets and socialist states as he has with the West.
                            Communism is alien to him. As he is deeply religious, lives by the
                            principles of the Koran and would deservedly lose support of his people
                            if he departed from those principles.</p>
                        <p>B. Central theme of <gloss target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss> is dedication to
                            independence, liberty, and the dignity, self-respect and equal rights of
                            the individual. He said Guinean independence had developed and been
                            strengthened through obstacles overcome, plots foiled and victories won.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TAS_1">Toure</persName> described at some
                            length the economic destitution of Guinea following its excommunication
                            by France and withdrawal of 12,000 Frenchmen within a month after he
                            opted for independence. Out of these trials has grown a deep mutual
                            trust between Guinean people and <persName corresp="#p_TAS_1"
                                >Toure</persName>’s leadership. He asserted it is trust born of the
                            principles of honesty, genuine interest in the welfare of the people and
                            concern for human rights. He cited equality accorded women in Guinea (in
                            contrast to many other African countries), lack of large differences in
                            pay scale and retirement provisions (the same for government ministers
                            as for lowest civil servant), pointed to fact that justice is free and
                            appeal to the law and judicial authorities at all levels involves no
                            monetary outlay. Nor does education, which has been vastly expanded and
                            is free to qualifying students through university level. He described
                            the principles underlying “pop<pb n="126" facs="0158" xml:id="pg_126"
                            />ular democracy” in Guinea and underscored extensive role played by
                            people’s organizations and local government authorities, asserting that
                            his efforts to inform them, guide them and solicit their active
                            participation in direction of the affairs of the country represent a
                            more democratic approach to government than can be found anywhere else
                            on continent. He added that he had criticized the Communist Party in
                            Soviet Union for representing such a small percentage of the
                            population.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_TAS_1">C. Toure</persName> then spoke with strong
                            emotion about his long struggle to maintain, first, Guinea’s
                            independence and thereafter the integrity and stability of his regime.
                            He described the vast propaganda campaign of distortion and vilification
                            directed against him and the attempts to assassinate him and overthrow
                            his regime. The 1970 Portuguese invasion was a major, traumatic event
                            which shook <persName corresp="#p_TAS_1">Toure</persName> and the memory
                            of which is still fresh and acutely painful and leads him to give
                            unhesitating priority to defense of his regime. He accused the West
                            Germans of complicity in the affair and repeatedly underscored his
                            abhorrence of treachery and betrayal and spoke of the revulsion of the
                            people against the traitors. He emphasized the active participation of
                            the people in arrest, conviction and sentencing of traitors, many of
                            whom were personal friends of his and whose defection was particularly
                            painful. He cited Kassory Bangour, Karim Bangoura (former Ambassador to
                            the US) and Catholic Archbishop Tchidimbo, whom <persName
                                corresp="#p_TAS_1">Toure</persName> had personally recommended for
                            the post against the candidate proposed by the Vatican. He asserted
                            Tchidimbo had then been recruited by Focart and turned against <gloss
                                target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss>. Then however, in [garble] as a
                            gesture of friendship and cooperation, <persName corresp="#p_TAS_1"
                                >Toure</persName> had acceded to President <persName
                                corresp="#p_TWR_1">Tolbert</persName>’s appeal for release of
                            Tchidimbo and had informed the Pope he would do everything possible to
                            prepare the people to accept his release. Unfortunately, premature
                            announcement of this by foreign news media put him in an awkward
                            position, threatening to make it look to his people as though
                            Tchidimbo’s release had been imposed on him as a condition for
                            reconciliation with Senegal and Ivory Coast. He had therefore suspended
                            Tchidimbo’s release until this unfortunate interpretation is forgotten.
                            Pointing to verification and documentation by <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss> Security Council, <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>,
                            etc., of the facts of the 1970 invasion, <persName corresp="#p_TAS_1"
                                >Toure</persName> said the question of release of prisoners is a
                            sensitive one touching the feelings of widows and relatives of victims,
                            and he maintained there would be hue and cry at release of those
                            responsible for atrocities. He cited Koranic teaching that the leader
                            cannot pardon traitors against the state; only the people can. In case
                            of 1970 invasion, <persName corresp="#p_TAS_1">Toure</persName> pointed
                            out that the people had condemned the traitors to death and it was he
                            who had commuted this to prison sentences. He said that appeared somehow
                            to be held against him, but he was prepared to accept the <pb n="127"
                                facs="0159" xml:id="pg_127"/>consequences. He cited cases of France,
                            Morocco, Zaire, Senegal and others who had unhesitatingly executed
                            traitors and assassins and had not incurred foreign criticism. He
                            pointed out that all foreigners involved in the 1970 event had been
                            released: Those remaining are all former <gloss target="#t_GOG_1"
                                >GOG</gloss> officials convicted of treason. <persName
                                corresp="#p_TAS_1">Toure</persName>’s historical review stopped
                            after the invasion and trials, omitting mention of the later arrests in
                            connection with the 1976 “Foulah Plot”.<note n="3" xml:id="d41fn3">In

                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_MRM_1">Moose</persName> thanked <persName
                                corresp="#p_TAS_1">Toure</persName> for eloquent and detailed
                            account of history and conditions under which underlying <gloss
                                target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss> principles had been formed, especially
                            the fight for independence. He said he was struck by fact that despite
                            all charges and suspicions on the part of those who continue to oppose
                            the <gloss target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss>, our outlook is so similar on
                            most African questions. He said if there was one problem that could
                            divide us, it is the question of human rights: He sincerely hoped it
                            would not. <persName corresp="#p_MRM_1">Moose</persName> emphasized
                            great importance attached to human rights by <persName

                            welcomed <persName corresp="#p_TAS_1">Toure</persName>’s raising the
                            subject, as he would like to discuss it further. <persName
                                corresp="#p_TAS_1">Toure</persName> responded that human rights is
                            one of the themes to be discussed at the 11th Party Congress in
                            September, which he said would reaffirm <gloss target="#t_GOG_1"
                                >GOG</gloss>’s dedication to these rights. Citing the fact that one
                            can walk in safety through any part of Guinea and referring to his
                            invitation to Guineans abroad to return, he drew the picture of a
                            country internally at peace with itself. He quoted from his own writings
                            praising Presidents Kennedy and <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                >Carter</persName> for the deep moral courage of their stand on
                            human rights and asserted that human rights considerations are central
                            to his philosophy of government: The <gloss target="#t_GOG_1"
                                >GOG</gloss> supports all those who fight for human rights.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MRM_1">Moose</persName> said it was not his
                            intention to criticize or attack the <gloss target="#t_GOG_1"
                                >GOG</gloss>, it was simply that there were serious possibilities of
                            misunderstandings on this important issue, and there were practical
                            problems involved; <pb n="128" facs="0160" xml:id="pg_128"/>he wanted to
                            do all he could to foster understanding and cooperation. He asked
                            whether the release of prisoners we had noted and welcomed during past
                            months would continue. <persName corresp="#p_TAS_1">Toure</persName>
                            replied that the prisoners had been condemned to death and it was hard
                            to release them because of bitter feelings of the population. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRM_1">Moose</persName> asked whether prisoners could
                            not be rehabilitated. <persName corresp="#p_TAS_1">Toure</persName> said
                            that would follow their release. <persName corresp="#p_MRM_1"
                                >Moose</persName> said in light of government’s present confidence
                            and stability, release of the prisoners now would be desirable as an act
                            of humanity, but <persName corresp="#p_TAS_1">Toure</persName> again
                            referred to 300 widows who would vociferously oppose. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRM_1">Moose</persName> asked how many prisoners there
                            were, and <persName corresp="#p_TAS_1">Toure</persName> answered with
                            some asperity that that is a matter of “public record”; Guinea is the
                            only country that publishes such information. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRM_1">Moose</persName> explained that it was necessary
                            to discuss the matter frankly, as we have difficulties with the Congress
                            on the subject and we want to avoid misunderstandings. <persName
                                corresp="#p_TAS_1">Toure</persName> retorted that there was already
                            misunderstanding; the facts of the invasion had all been established by
                                <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Security Council; he found it
                            painful if, in pressing for release of prisoners, we were showing more
                            concern for a few traitors than we did for the interests of the entire
                            population and state of Guinea. These traitors had been condemned to
                            death, and he had said “give them life”. By now thoroughly worked up,
                                <persName corresp="#p_TAS_1">Toure</persName> asserted that this was
                            a matter for Guinea alone to decide; he would not be pressured into
                            releasing one prisoner by considerations of foreign aid; if aid donors
                            want to withhold assistance, they can do so. President’s half-brother,
                            Ismael Toure, intervened at that point and asked the President’s
                            permission to summarize and interpret his views. He then said that while
                            Guinea would never give in to pressure or submit to blackmail, we should
                            recall Guinea’s releases of prisoners over the past year and more;
                            nothing the President had said indicated that this would not continue.
                            We would simply have to draw our own conclusion and trust the Chief of
                            State on this. <persName corresp="#p_TAS_1">Sekou Toure</persName>
                            agreed with this interpretation, and <persName corresp="#p_MRM_1"
                                >Moose</persName> said he would be glad to report that to Washington
                            and would do what he could to explain the situation in the interest of
                            continued strengthening of our mutual relations.</p>
                        <p>5. With that, the meeting ended and <persName corresp="#p_TAS_1"
                                >Toure</persName> invited the US representatives and several
                            ministers to the lunch that had been waiting for some hours. The tense,
                            charged atmosphere of the formal discussions fell away at once, and
                                <persName corresp="#p_TAS_1">Toure</persName>, having made his
                            defense of his 20 years in power, was relaxed and cheerful, providing an
                            incisive, realistic analysis of various current African problems (<gloss
                                target="#t_septel_1">septel</gloss>). After the meal, he accompanied
                            his guests down the stairs to the front entrance, said a warm goodby and
                            expressed thanks and appreciation for the Moose visit to Guinea.</p>
                        <p>6. Comment: <persName corresp="#p_TAS_1">Toure</persName> came through as
                            a strong, determined man, dedicated to underlying principles of
                            independence, self-respect and <pb n="129" facs="0161" xml:id="pg_129"
                            />development of Guinea to the benefit of all the people. His interest
                            in the understanding of and closer economic association with the US
                            appeared completely genuine, but his pride and resentment at being
                            pushed hard on the human rights issue caused him to take a more
                            uncompromising stance than appears to be the case in practice. Ismael
                            Toure’s helpful intervention pointed to this, and a later conversation
                            that prisoner releases will indeed continue, as we had been led to
                            expect (ref B). In sum, the extended exchange between <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRM_1">Moose</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TAS_1"
                                >Toure</persName> was extremely useful, offering both parties
                            opportunity to set forth their principles, views and concerns, and
                            clearing the way for greater mutual understanding and closer
                            communication and perhaps cooperation on various African problems. End

                            presence, and indications are that there will be an early withdrawal,—if
                            for no other reason than the fact that <persName corresp="#p_TAS_1"

                            growing urban workers’ dilemma of a slow-growth economy and wildly

                            stress in that society is that the ruling elite has traditionally been
                            an Americo-Liberian society (returned former slaves) which has
                            systematically dominated the indigenous population. <persName

                                >Dennis</persName> called on the Secretary for an hour and a half
                            April 30. Most of the meeting was taken up by <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCC_1">Dennis</persName>’s explanation of the background
                            of the Easter weekend riot in Monrovia.<note n="3" xml:id="d44fn3">See
                                    <ref target="#d43">Document 43</ref>.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DCC_1">Dennis</persName> said the principal causes
                            were the radicalization of Liberian university students in recent years,
                            and their disaffection with the government. The situation was
                            exacerbated by the presence in Monrovia of large numbers of half
                            educated unemployed. Although <persName corresp="#p_DCC_1"
                                >Dennis</persName> was certain that there had been some indirect
                            Soviet encouragement of the demonstration, he admitted the authorities
                            could not document a specific connection. He appealed for assistance in
                            the form of a grant to help reconstruct Monrovia, and a development loan
                            to finance projects that would put the unemployed to work. He made no
                            specific suggestions. End summary.</p>

                                >Carter</persName>: <persName corresp="#p_DCC_1">Dennis</persName>
                            acknowledged the Secretary’s welcome, conveyed President <persName
                                corresp="#p_TWR_1">Tolbert</persName>’s greetings to the Secretary,
                            and emphasized that at <persName corresp="#p_TWR_1">Tolbert</persName>’s
                            direction he had taken special pains to keep the U.S. Embassy in
                            Monrovia informed of Liberian Government views of the background and the
                            events of the riot in Monrovia during Easter weekend. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCC_1">Dennis</persName> said <persName
                                corresp="#p_TWR_1">Tolbert</persName> had entrusted him with a
                            message to President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> and
                            that he hoped to deliver it in person. <persName corresp="#p_DCC_1"
                                >Dennis</persName> said that, “At this time of national crisis,” the
                            fact that President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> had
                            received <persName corresp="#p_TWR_1">Tolbert</persName>’s special
                            emissary would in itself have a favorable psychological effect by
                            underlining U.S. support for Liberia. The Secretary replied that the
                            President was extremely busy, that he could make no promises, but that
                            he would see what he could do.</p>
                        <p>3. Background of riot: <persName corresp="#p_DCC_1">Dennis</persName>
                            explained the background of the riot as follows. In 1974 Bacchus
                                <persName corresp="#p_MGB_1">Matthews</persName>, a recent graduate,
                            was Vice <pb n="134" facs="0166" xml:id="pg_134"/>Consul in New York. He
                            was dismissed for misappropriation of funds. He subsequently claimed
                            that he was fired for political reasons, and became anti-government. The
                            Progressive Alliance of Liberia was founded in New York in 1974. From
                            its published statements there can be no doubt of its “alien
                            indoctrination.” It was joined by disaffected students, including some
                            who had lost their scholarships. <persName corresp="#p_DCC_1"
                                >Dennis</persName> described at some length President <persName
                                corresp="#p_TWR_1">Tolbert</persName>’s interest in the welfare of
                            the people as a whole, and his efforts to enlist the support and
                            participation of Liberian youth, particularly recent graduates. Despite
                            these efforts, the PAL established an office in Monrovia and succeeded
                            in infiltrating the university. There its views were condoned and
                            supported by some professors, many trained in the U.S., who “taught that
                            the free enterprise system was no good.” The PAL and similar groups were
                            critical of the West in general and the U.S. in particular.</p>
                        <p>4. In response to the Secretary’s question, <persName corresp="#p_DCC_1"
                                >Dennis</persName> said the centers of student disaffection were
                            Monrovia and Cuttington College, but that similar views were being
                            expressed in the interior, because there is no restriction of travel in
                            Liberia. <persName corresp="#p_DCC_1">Dennis</persName> added that
                            although the spread of education in Liberia had been impressive in
                            recent years, it had also resulted in a substantial increase in the
                            number of “half educated” unemployed in the cities, who were an easy
                            prey to ideologues. Although <persName corresp="#p_TWR_1"
                                >Tolbert</persName> had emphasized education, often at the expense
                            of strengthening the security forces, more attention must now be paid to
                            improving the effectiveness of these forces.</p>
                        <p>5. External involvement: In response to the Secretary’s question,
                                <persName corresp="#p_DCC_1">Dennis</persName> said that there “had
                            to have been” external support for the dissidents. Their leaders had no
                            jobs, but lived reasonably well, traveled both in Liberia and abroad,
                            and published a paper. However, the Liberian authorities could not
                            identify a specific link between the alleged instigators of the
                            demonstration and a foreign government. In retrospect, the Liberian
                            Government thought there might be more than coincidence in the facts
                            that a Russian student told a student meeting in Lome that he had to be
                            in Monrovia by the 14th, that North Korean and Cuban delegations were in
                            Monrovia at the same time, that some alleged leaders of the
                            demonstration had been seen in the Soviet Embassy the night before, and
                            that three officers of the Soviet Embassy had visited PAL headquarters
                            on the eve of the demonstration.</p>
                        <p>6. Proposal to increase rice prices: <persName corresp="#p_DCC_1"
                                >Dennis</persName> explained in detail the background of the
                            Minister of Agriculture’s proposal to increase the price of rice, and
                            the lengthy discussion of this proposal in the Cabinet and with
                            concerned groups in Liberia including the PAL. He said that despite the
                            denial of a permit to demonstrate against the proposal, <persName
                                corresp="#p_MGB_1">Matthews</persName> and the PAL went ahead
                            anyway.</p>
                        <p>7. Organization of demonstration: <persName corresp="#p_DCC_1"
                                >Dennis</persName> said the demonstration had caught the Liberian
                            Government by surprise. Although spear<pb n="135" facs="0167"
                                xml:id="pg_135"/>headed by unemployed toughs “made brave by dope and
                            liquor” it had clearly required considerable planning, as shown by the
                            skill with which roadblocks were thrown up and by the success with which
                            the leaders later eluded arrest. <persName corresp="#p_DCC_1"
                                >Dennis</persName> thanked the Secretary because the Embassy had
                            denied <persName corresp="#p_MGB_1">Matthews</persName> asylum. In
                            response to the Secretary’s question <persName corresp="#p_DCC_1"
                                >Dennis</persName> said the purpose of the demonstration was to
                            create a “state of anarchy” in Monrovia. In reply to <persName
                                corresp="#p_HWC_1">Harrop</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_DCC_1"
                                >Dennis</persName> said the demonstrators were not armed with
                            firearms.</p>
                        <p>8. Support from other governments: <persName corresp="#p_DCC_1"
                                >Dennis</persName> described the support Liberia had received from
                            other states. Guinea had sent a delegation on the 15th and the next day
                            had sent a second delegation accompanied by 50 troops. The total Guinean
                            strength in Monrovia was just under 300. <persName corresp="#p_DCC_1"
                                >Dennis</persName> did not make clear whether <persName
                                corresp="#p_TWR_1">Tolbert</persName> had requested Guinean troops
                            or not, but said that when the first group arrived <persName
                                corresp="#p_TWR_1">Tolbert</persName> “did not turn them away” and
                            implied that the second group of 220 came to complement the first.
                            President <persName corresp="#p_HF_1">Houphouet-Boigny</persName> sent a

                            for military assistance. The Secretary noted that U.S. military
                            equipment would arrive very shortly.</p>

                            forthcoming comments to <persName corresp="#p_TWR_1">Tolbert</persName>
                            during and following his visit to Monrovia in April 1978 on the subject
                            of assistance.<note n="4" xml:id="d44fn4">See <ref target="#d34"

                            “reconstruction program.” There was a good possibility that insurance
                            could cover some claims arising from the riots, but “the little man
                            needs help.” Liberia had an obligation to hold the <gloss
                                target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> summit on schedule. Liberia had two
                            specific needs: A grant to provide immediate assistance, and help to
                            repair some or all of the dols 50 million in damage caused by the riot;
                            and a long term development loan to finance projects that would take the
                            unemployed off the streets. The Secretary asked if the Liberian
                            Government had appealed to any other donor, and mentioned the African
                            Development Bank. <persName corresp="#p_DCC_1">Dennis</persName> said
                            that thus far an appeal had been made only to the U.S., Liberia’s
                            greatest friend. He was sure the U.S. would not want to turn down its
                            closest ally in Africa, especially just before the <gloss
                                target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> summit. <persName corresp="#p_DCC_1"
                                >Dennis</persName> asked if the U.S. could reexamine the
                            possibilities of encouraging long term investment.</p>
                        <p>10. The Secretary replied that he thought it important to distinguish
                            between short and long term needs. Encouraging investment took
                            considerable time. He could give no assurances, but the Department and
                                <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> would examine the possibilities
                            carefully. The United States valued the special relationship. He asked
                            precisely what the Liberians thought <pb n="136" facs="0168"
                                xml:id="pg_136"/>they required. <persName corresp="#p_DCC_1"
                                >Dennis</persName> replied that it was difficult to be specific. He
                            had come, “as a patient comes to a doctor, to be told what he
                            needs.”</p>
                        <p>11. Middle East: Picking up a complimentary comment <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCC_1">Dennis</persName> had made regarding U.S.
                            contribution to peace in the Middle East, the Secretary said we are now
                            in the second stage of the peace making process, and must deal with the
                            enormously complex Palestinian question. He said he was somewhat
                            troubled by statements made after President <persName corresp="#p_TWR_1"
                                >Tolbert</persName>’s visit to Kuwait which appeared to indicate
                            little understanding of the situation. The Camp David summit had
                            established the first and only realistic framework for dealing with this
                            extremely difficult problem, and we would appreciate support from our
                            friends. <persName corresp="#p_DCC_1">Dennis</persName> replied that the
                            Liberians had not expected a communique to be proposed in Kuwait, and
                            said that he had greatly watered down the original draft proposed to him
                            by the Kuwaitis.</p>
                        <p>12. <gloss target="#t_NAM_1">NAM</gloss>: The Secretary said he thought
                            it would be disastrous and unfair if Egypt were expelled from the
                            Non-Aligned Movement. To say that Egypt does not have a right to make
                            peace to recover lost territory is shocking. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCC_1">Dennis</persName> said Liberia wished to support
                            the U.S. view, and suggested that assisting Liberia to hold the <gloss
                                target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> summit might be the best means to this

                            c/ft./day, and flare 95% of it. They now sell us over 1 billion b/d of
                            crude oil,—50% of their production, 15% of our imports. There have been
                            rumors of threats to cut this supply to some degree or other, in
                            response to a positive Case-Javits determination.<note n="5"

                        <p>Your letter of May 24<note n="2" xml:id="d46fn2">See <ref
                                    target="#d45fn2">footnote 2, Document 45</ref>.</note> was, as
                            always, true to the forthright spirit which has characterized our
                            exchanges since we first met in Washington. Because we have been able to
                            communicate in this open and direct manner, I have personally found much
                            value in our regular correspondence.</p>
                        <p>The international energy situation is a matter of paramount concern to
                            both of us. I appreciate that Nigeria has expanded its oil exports over
                            the last six months, helping to relieve the shortfall in world supply. I
                            know that your decisions on oil production have been and will be based
                            on a profound concern for Nigeria’s long-term interest in a stable world
                            economy.</p>
                        <p>I understand your impatience with the slow pace of action to end the
                            waste of Nigeria’s gas resources. I share your concern and hope a
                            feasible solution can be found. The discussions between the Bonny <gloss
                                target="#t_LNG_1">LNG</gloss> Company and a group of American firms
                            on the sale of liquefied natural gas to the United States seemed to
                            offer promise of such a <pb n="139" facs="0171" xml:id="pg_139"
                            />solution, provided a formula reconciling energy, legal and market
                            considerations could be devised.</p>
                        <p>It is important that your government’s discussions with potential United
                            States buyers proceed with the fullest possible understanding of
                            relevant United States laws, policies, and energy markets. I propose,
                            therefore, to send to Lagos a small delegation of economic and energy
                            specialists to discuss with your government the factors likely to be
                            critical to a decision by United States regulatory agencies in this
                                instance.<note n="3" xml:id="d46fn3">See <ref target="#d48">Document
                                    48</ref>.</note></p>
                        <p>I am advised that no application for importation of Nigerian <gloss
                                target="#t_LNG_1">LNG</gloss> has yet been filed with our regulatory
                            agencies.</p>
                        <p>If convenient to your government, the delegation could be in Lagos in
                            mid-July. That timing also would enable the delegation to provide
                            background on the decisions of the Economic Summit in Tokyo.</p>
                        <p>It is a matter of great importance that Nigeria and the United States
                            maintain relations of full understanding and cooperation. I share your
                            determination to try to achieve solutions of differences through full
                            and frank discussion.</p>

                        <p>During a 70-minute exchange, <persName corresp="#p_TAS_1">Sekou
                                Toure</persName> said he agreed that the <gloss target="#t_NAM_1"
                                >NAM</gloss> should not be dominated by the Soviets. He was working
                            with <persName corresp="#p_TJB_1">Tito</persName> to seek a collegial
                            leadership for the <gloss target="#t_NAM_1">NAM</gloss> rather than a
                            single president (<persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Castro</persName>). He
                            expected their proposal to be accepted. The President and <persName
                                corresp="#p_TAS_1">Sekou Toure</persName> agreed on the urgent need
                            for resolution of Southern Africa issues. <persName corresp="#p_TAS_1"
                                >Toure</persName> acknowledged that Muzorewa was a bona fide
                            political leader and felt that a negotiated reconciliation with the
                            Patriotric Front should be possible. In response to the President’s
                            request that Guinea support Sadat, <persName corresp="#p_TAS_1">Sekou
                                Toure</persName> replied indirectly by emphasizing his close
                            personal relationship with Sadat. The President underlined American
                            concern about human rights questions, and congratulated <persName
                                corresp="#p_TAS_1">Sekou Toure</persName> on the release from prison

                                    >Carter</persName></hi> welcomed the Guinean delegation, noting
                            pleasure at our new friendship and the fine record of American
                            investment in Guinea. He congratulated President <persName

                            Africa, his mediation of conflicts, and his forthcoming presidency of
                            the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>. The President commented on our
                            mutual concern for the enhancement of human rights. He knew that
                                <persName corresp="#p_TAS_1">Sekou Toure</persName> appreciated the
                            importance of this issue to the American people. The President
                            congratulated <persName corresp="#p_TAS_1">Sekou Toure</persName> on the
                            release the previous day of Archbishop Tchidimbo.</p>

                                Toure</persName></hi> said he was happy to be in Washington and was
                            determined to improve cooperation between Guinea and the United States.
                            He then presented an historical sketch of Guinea since the 13th century,
                            emphasizing the country’s resistance to colonial domination. He
                            described how he, starting from the labor movement, had led Guinea
                            toward freedom and toward the historic vote of 1958 when Guinea was the
                            only one of 13 French colonies in Africa to chose independence. Since
                            that time Guinea had been wrongly accused of communism and extremism.
                            Guinea had a very bad press and wished to be judged on its actions not
                            upon what people said of it. The Guinean people and their leaders were
                            deeply religious, poor in material terms but not poor spiritually; they
                            had a refined sense of human dignity.</p>
                        <p>Turning to contemporary African problems, <hi rend="italic"><persName
                                    corresp="#p_TAS_1">Toure</persName></hi> urged the U.S. to lend
                            its effective support to self-determination, so that blacks and whites
                            could have equal rights in South Africa, and the people of Zimbabwe
                            could live together in true self-determination, so that Namibia could
                            reach independence under international and <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss> auspices.</p>

                                    >Carter</persName></hi> said he had listened with attention to
                                <persName corresp="#p_TAS_1">Sekou Toure</persName>’s explanation of
                            Guinea and the courage of its people, who insisted upon independence and
                            freedom. All Western nations were gratified by the improving
                            relationship between themselves and Guinea. He had discussed this among
                            leaders of the West who all felt this evolution is of mutual benefit to
                            the industrialized nations and to Guinea. The President said he admired
                            the way Guinea had been able to utilize American aid and looked forward
                            to some expansion of both this assistance and of trade between our
                            countries.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President</hi> said he hoped that <persName

                            be faced with the core problem of apartheid. If apartheid could be
                            abolished then there would be an excellent prospect for cooperation

                            between Muzorewa and the Patriotic Front on condition that the reality

                            knew that this was no solution. Muzorewa was a political leader
                            regardless of how one evaluated the election. The Patriotic Front and
                            the leaders of the Salisbury regime must come together and initiate a
                            reconciliation in good faith. There must also be good faith shown toward
                            the armed cadres of the Patriotic Front who had fought and suffered for
                            their independence. They were really the ones whose interests were

                            had had a long and useful exchange with Sadat at the Monrovia conference
                            in July about the Middle East peace process. Sadat was a fine and
                            courageous leader.</p>

                            understanding between the U.S. and Guinea. The President recalled that

                            the President had expressed his concern over the deployment of Soviet TU

                            flights. This had opened a period of warmer relations between us which

                                delegation to Nigeria to discuss critical factors in U.S. regulatory
                                decisions on <gloss target="#t_LNG_1">LNG</gloss> imports, and to
                                provide background on the Tokyo Summit. These discussions were held
                                in Lagos on August 1 and 2. The U.S. delegation consisted of Deputy
                                Assistant Secretary of Energy Peter Borre, Deputy Assistant
                                Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_HR_1">Robert

                                was headed by the Managing Director of the Nigerian National
                                Petroleum Corporation (<gloss target="#t_NNPC_1">NNPC</gloss>), F.

                                />Consultations on <gloss target="#t_LNG_1">LNG</gloss> Imports</p>
                            <p>The U.S. team described the complex U.S. gas import review
                                procedures, and the U.S. gas market outlook. The major points
                                were:</p>
                            <p>—The U.S. attaches great importance to its relationship with Nigeria,
                                and bilateral energy trade; these consultations represent a special
                                effort on our part to address Nigerian concerns.</p>
                            <p>—There is a high degree of autonomy in U.S. regulatory procedures,
                                hence the executive branch cannot commit itself, or prejudge the
                                results of quasi-judicial proceedings.</p>
                            <p>—Imported <gloss target="#t_LNG_1">LNG</gloss> will need to find
                                customers in the industrial sector. Because residual fuel oil is the
                                major alternative for the industrial sector, <gloss
                                    target="#t_LNG_1">LNG</gloss> will need to be price competitive
                                with residual oil; U.S. gas companies will thus need a landed <gloss
                                    target="#t_LNG_1">LNG</gloss> price competitive with “resid.”
                                (Currently Nigeria is proposing a price too high to be attractive to
                                U.S. industry).</p>
                            <p>In response, the Nigerians asked about specifics such as price
                                escalator formula components, <hi rend="italic">force majeure</hi>
                                clauses and allowability of prepayments.</p>
                            <p>The discussions were substantive, low key and friendly; the Nigerians
                                seem to have concluded that the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                                is genuinely interested in pursuing the possibility of <gloss
                                    target="#t_LNG_1">LNG</gloss> imports, but that much work
                                remained to be done, with commercial and regulatory criteria being
                                the determinative factors.</p>
                            <p>Marinho at the conclusion asked that future consultations be
                                formalized through a joint energy working group (which could join
                                the four working groups already established by President <persName
                                    corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> and General <persName
                                    corresp="#p_OO_1">Obasanjo</persName>). We have already conveyed
                                our agreement to this proposal.</p>
                            <p rend="sectiontitleital">Tokyo Summit Results</p>
                            <p><persName corresp="#p_HR_1">Hormats</persName> stressed the
                                commitment of the Tokyo Summit participants to limit future oil
                                    imports.<note n="4" xml:id="d48fn4">For the portion of the

                                        Document 221</ref>.</note> This was in part a response to
                                urgings from <gloss target="#t_OPEC_1">OPEC</gloss> countries that
                                industrialized countries contribute to stability in the oil market
                                through greater conservation. We underlined our hope that <gloss
                                    target="#t_OPEC_1">OPEC</gloss>, in turn, would also contribute
                                to a more stable oil market by responsible price and production
                                policies.</p>
                            <p>The U.S. team pointed out that the Summit countries had committed
                                themselves to help LDCs increase energy production, and noted that
                                the U.S. has a program to help them assess their future energy needs
                                and sources of production. The U.S. side said that, while Nigeria
                                    <pb n="146" facs="0178" xml:id="pg_146"/>differs from most LDCs
                                which are energy importers we understand its desire to develop
                                energy other than oil. We have done energy assessments in Egypt and
                                Peru and are exploring the possibilities with Venezuela on a
                                reimbursable basis. We would be pleased, should Nigeria be
                                interested to discuss possibilities in greater detail.</p>

                            <p>In a private conversation Marinho told Borre that the Federal

                                of:</p>
                            <p>—The July 31 nationalization of <gloss target="#t_BP_1">BP</gloss>,
                                which gave <gloss target="#t_NNPC_1">NNPC</gloss> “almost 300,000
                                b/pd” of <gloss target="#t_BP_1">BP</gloss> equity oil, “most of
                                which has been going to the United States.”<note n="5"

                                    Central Foreign Policy File, D790347–0976)</note></p>
                            <p>—Pending applications from U.S. refiner/importers, also for “almost
                                300,000 b/pd.”</p>
                            <p>—New “flexibility” for <gloss target="#t_NNPC_1">NNPC</gloss>, due to
                                the August 1 production cutback of 240,000 b/pd.</p>
                            <p>By flexibility, Marinho was hinting at restoring some of the cutback,
                                notwithstanding the technical rationale (which our Embassy is
                                inclined to believe notwithstanding some skepticism expressed by the
                                oil companies) used by Nigeria to justify the cutback.</p>
                            <p>Borre responded that:</p>
                            <p>—Geographic and oil quality factors have made the U.S. a natural
                                outlet for Nigerian exports.</p>
                            <p>—Given market tightness, cutbacks in oil flows to the U.S. are a
                                matter of concern in Washington; the need to rebuild distillate
                                inventories makes the United States especially sensitive to Nigerian
                                actions, because of the suitability of Nigerian oil for light
                                products.</p>
                            <p>—With the possibility of a quota mechanism to back up U.S. oil import
                                ceilings, both countries have a strong interest in steady, reliable
                                energy trade.</p>
                            <p>Marinho seemed receptive to these points and indicated he would draw
                                upon them in preparing materials for the <gloss target="#t_FMG_1"

                            achievement of the Conference was the resolution on human rights.
                            Africans should have the same standards for human rights as they expect
                            from the rest of the world. He noted that the human rights seminar held
                            in Monrovia after the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> Conference
                            had reached a number of important decisions. (C)</p>

                                >Tolbert</persName> said he felt a second important outcome was the
                            resolution on economic liberation. Africans had struggled in the past to
                            achieve political liberation, and while some problems remain, such as
                            apartheid, the present struggle will center around economic liberation.
                            If economic dependency and underdevelopment continue, Africans will
                            still not be free. He noted that the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1"
                                >OAU</gloss> Conference had drawn up a strategy for Africa’s
                            economic development aimed at the continent’s future self-sufficiency.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TWR_1">Tolbert</persName> urged that the U.S.
                            move decisively to help the Africans with economic development. Eastern
                            countries had seized opportunities to help with political liberation,
                            but Africans, he said, realized that those countries could not resolve
                            the continent’s problems. U.S. help as a common friend and ally would be
                            much appreciated at this time. (C)</p>

                                >SWAPO</gloss>’s presence on the Angolan border makes them very

                                >Carter</persName> noted that in conversations with Angolan leaders
                            the U.S. had encouraged the withdrawal of <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1"
                                >SWAPO</gloss> forces from the border and of South African troops
                            from the whole area. The Angolans have stated that they need only a

                                <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> noted that the U.S.
                            had cooperated with Angola in helping to defuse the Shaba situation and
                            to demilitarize the Angola/Zaire border. Both the U.S. and Angola seek a
                            non-apartheid government in Namibia, and the U.S. awaits the eventual
                            Cuban withdrawal the Angolans have discussed. (C)</p>
                        <p>(d) <persName corresp="#p_TWR_1">Tolbert</persName> urged that the

                            leadership, and that the two sides should not waste time assessing each
                            other’s leaders at this point. President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                >Carter</persName> agreed that this was a very good point and asked
                            the Deputy Secretary to pursue it through Ambassador <persName

                                >Carter</persName> continued that the U.S. would like to see Angola
                            move out of the Soviet/Cuban orbit to become more truly non-aligned.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TWR_1">Tolbert</persName> volunteered to do

                            Chairman, and noted that it would be very useful if the Contact Group of

                            had called for the self-determination of the people of the Sahara.
                            Mauritania had pulled out of its section in the Sahara and Morocco had
                            moved in. He said that he had called a meeting of the Wise Men and
                            representatives of neighboring countries for October 16 in Monrovia, but
                            that participation posed a problem. The Polisario wants to be there, but
                            the Moroccans fear the Polisario would adversely influence the meeting.
                            Further, <persName corresp="#p_TWR_1">Tolbert</persName> questioned
                            whether Chadli of Algeria would attend if the Polisario were absent.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> said it reminded him

                            noted that African leaders at the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>
                            Conference had agreed that lifting of sanctions was tantamount to

                            difficult to adhere to his present position. He noted that the U.S.
                            would work closely with the British, who had the proper legal status to
                            resolve the issue. As for the question of armies, he noted that the

                            before. As a result he had asked the Russians to reduce the size of
                            their mission in Monrovia. He noted that Liberia faced certain social
                            problems and that he was moving to solve these problems, but that
                            resources were limited. (C)</p>

                                >Tolbert</persName> asked that the U.S. Government consider a

                                >Carter</persName> responded by noting Liberia’s highest in Africa
                            per capita assistance and Congressional strictness in allocating large
                            sums for aid programs. (C)</p>

                                >Tolbert</persName> noted that Liberia had once hoped to become
                            self-sufficient in rice production, but that now it would be useful to
                            have a P.L. 480 program again. The Acting Secretary responded that a
                            program was not planned for next year; Assistant Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRM_1">Moose</persName> explained that the Liberia
                            program had been established in response to a certain need at a certain
                            time, and as other countries’ requirements gradually surpassed
                            Liberia’s, the program was stopped. <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                >Carter</persName> proposed that the delegation might include some
                            agricultural experts. Noting that Liberians would know more about their
                            own agricultural situation than outsiders, he added that the experts
                            might be useful in discussing their tree crop technology. (C)</p>

                            Liberians would be the military housing program and the relocation of
                            the University. (C)</p>

                        <p>Following the overthrow of the Shah of Iran last winter, the Nigerian
                            military government adopted an aggressive oil policy that for the first
                            time involved the use of Nigerian oil as a political weapon. The
                            Nigerians were able to take advantage of the tight world oil market and
                            record prices that allowed production cuts without a significant loss in
                            vital petroleum revenues. [<hi rend="italic">classification marking not

                        <p>The new government of President Shagari—Nigeria’s first civilian
                            administration in 13 years—has been too busy setting up house to do much
                            on the oil front. Shagari, however, has announced he too will be quick
                            to use the oil weapon if necessary in pursuit of majority rule in
                            southern Africa. He has given no indication that he plans to revise
                            aggressive oil-related decisions by the military government. [<hi

                        <p>The Nigerians will be watching the United States closely in the coming
                            months for any sign that it is softening its opposition to minority rule
                            in southern Africa. In addition, Washington has been on notice since
                            last May that it will risk the US status as a “preferred” customer if it
                            fails to approve the importation of Nigerian liquefied natural gas—seen
                            by Lagos as an important potential source of foreign exchange to offset
                            an expected decline in oil exports after the mid-1980s.<note n="2"

                        <p>We doubt that the new government will impose an oil embargo against the
                            United States, because it would be difficult to enforce. Lagos has other
                            effective and more easily executed options, including imposing a
                            selective cutback on oil production by US companies, a ban on company
                            purchases of government-owned crude, or nationalization of the
                            companies’ remaining equity in Nigerian oil. [<hi rend="italic"

                            on the Iranian scale. But a number of potential flashpoints—including
                            tribal conflicts and resentment over privileges held by expatriate
                            personnel—eventually may provoke trouble that would severely test the

                        <p><hi rend="italic">The US has traditionally maintained warm relations with
                                Senegal under the moderate, pro-Western leadership of President
                                Leopold Senghor, who has governed since independence in 1960.
                                Dakar’s moderate foreign policies, which frequently support US
                                interests, stem mainly from Senghor’s fear of Soviet intervention in
                                Africa and elsewhere. Senghor, who supports the Camp David accords
                                and US human rights policies, would like to develop closer economic
                                and military ties with the US, but not at the expense of
                                jeopardizing relations with France, Senegal’s principal
                                benefactor.</hi> [<hi rend="italic">portion marking not

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Senegal’s most pressing problems are a burgeoning
                                population, a stagnant economy, and weathering Senghor’s planned
                                retirement prior to the next election in 1983. Although the
                                succession to Senghor may be marked by some political conflict, on
                                balance Senegal’s institutional stability should prevail. Senghor’s
                                successor almost certainly will not be as forceful a proponent of
                                Western views on the international scene, but probably will continue
                                to follow moderate, democratic principles.</hi> [<hi rend="italic"

                        <p>Senghor’s stature as an elder statesman and as a renowned
                            poet-philosopher, his vigorous personal diplomacy, and his
                            long-established relationship with world political and intellectual
                            leaders give Senegal influence far out of proportion to the country’s
                            limited economic and military resources. [<hi rend="italic">portion

                        <p>Senghor earnestly opposes Soviet influence in Africa and elsewhere in the
                            nonaligned world, and his suspicion of Soviet intentions colors many
                            aspects of Senegalese foreign policy. His diplomatic and moral support
                            for Morocco in the Western Sahara dispute, for example, is motivated in
                            part by his fear that the Algerians—by backing the Polisario—are acting
                            as the Soviet surrogate to destabilize West Africa. Senegal is one of
                            the few <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> members that still refuse
                            to recognize the Soviet-backed government in Angola, and Senghor

                        <p>Senghor has been mildly critical of what he sees as US reluctance to help
                            friendly countries resist Soviet-Cuban intervention. The US decision to
                            sell arms to Morocco and Washington’s strong reaction to the Afghanistan
                            invasion however, have reassured him. Senegal took a leading role in the
                            United Nations debate on Afghanistan with a searing attack on the Soviet
                            intervention. Last summer, Senegal agreed to US urgings to attend the
                            Nonaligned Summit in Havana and openly criticized Cuban manipulation of
                            the meeting’s procedures and voting. [<hi rend="italic">portion marking

                        <p>Senegal is one of a handful of African countries with a commendable human
                            rights record. Senghor is using his influence to pressure the <gloss
                                target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> into agreeing that human rights
                            guarantees are as applicable to black Africa as they are to white-ruled

                        <p>In another reflection of his pro-Western orientation, Senghor has granted
                            the US informal access to facilities at Dakar. American military
                            aircraft have been allowed to use Dakar airport, for example during the
                            airlift of men and material to Zaire’s Shaba province in 1978. More
                            recently, the Senegalese Government has permitted US naval
                            reconnaissance aircraft to use the airport as a staging base for
                            following Soviet ship movements. [<hi rend="italic">portion marking not

                        <p>A few of Senghor’s policies conflict with US interests. Although he
                            promotes dialogue between Israel and Arab states and probably would like
                            to restore Senegal’s relations with Israel, Senghor believes the
                            Israelis should be more generous in negotiations with the Arabs and that
                            the Palestinians must be given a greater voice in any negotiated
                            settlement. In the North-South dialogue, Senegal is a vigorous proponent
                            of more assistance from developed countries to the Third World. [<hi

                            Interests</p>
                        <p>Senegal’s economy, plagued by unfavorable climatic conditions, depressed
                            markets for its major exports—peanuts and phosphates—and a rapidly
                            growing population, registered little overall growth in the last decade.
                            Burdened with continual budgetary deficits, the country is dependent for
                            survival on the largesse of France—the former colonial power—and
                            international organizations. An ambitious economic plan launched last
                            December aims to restructure the existing economic system by shrinking
                            the government sector, opening Senegal to foreign investment, granting
                            farmers more benefits, and removing price subsidies for urban consumers.
                            Some of its more austere measures could lead to unrest, especially among
                            the urban population. [<hi rend="italic">portion marking not

                            preoccupied with the succession issue. Senghor, who has dominated the
                            country since independence in 1960, reportedly plans to step down before
                            his term ends in 1983. He believes that this will enable his chosen
                            successor, Prime Minister Diouf, to establish himself before the next
                            presidential election. Diouf, who reflects Senghor’s moderate,
                            pro-Western views, has assumed the major share of day-to-day government
                            responsibilities over the last few years. A reform-minded technocrat,
                            the Prime Minister has not gained the complete confidence of leaders in
                            the ruling party and the military and lacks a strong grass-roots base.
                            He could face a serious challenge for the office from the more
                            conservative old guard of Senghor’s dominant Socialist Party or from the
                            leader of the principal opposition party. Neither of these elements,
                            however, would be likely to impose policies inimical to US interests.
                            Moreover, the country’s institutional stability and the general respect
                            for constitutional procedures should help reduce chances for major
                            disruptions. Senegal without Senghor probably will play a diminished
                            role on the African and international scene, as any new leader will be
                            preoccupied with domestic economic and social problems. As a result, the
                            US may have to work harder to obtain Senegal’s support on controversial
                            international issues. [<hi rend="italic">portion marking not

                            multilateral projects such as the Senegal River Development Organization
                            and the Sahel Development Program and trains a small number of

                        <p>The US is Senegal’s second largest trading partner, exporting about $40
                            million in goods per year to Dakar. US investment in Senegal also is
                            modest—about $25 million, with fixed asset investment mainly limited to
                            petroleum marketing and phosphate mining. France remains Senegal’s
                            largest financial and military donor, foreign investor, and trading
                            partner, although President Senghor has expressed a desire to expand

                            private visit, and was hosted in Washington D.C. by Mayor Marion Barry.

                        <p>The President opened by noting the compatibility of ideas between the
                            U.S. and Senegal on the Soviet/Cuban threat to Africa, and the necessity
                            for maintaining the political and economic strength to meet that threat.
                            (S)</p>
                        <p>President Senghor responded that he is concerned by the Soviet menace
                            both in Asia and Africa, and disappointed about the level of support for
                            the U.S. on Iran and Afghanistan, particularly by the French and the
                            Germans. (S)</p>
                        <p>The President replied that while the allies had not been as firm and
                            united on these issues as they might have been, he remains optimistic
                            that in the long run they will be more supportive of efforts to oppose
                            Soviet aggression in Afghanistan and the use of Soviet surrogates to
                            destabilize Africa. (S)</p>
                        <p>President Senghor said that he would raise the issues in upcoming talks

                            Embassy in Tehran, as a way of helping in the hostage situation. (S)</p>
                        <p>Senghor repeated his position that Senegal would not be able to support
                            the Olympic boycott, because this would be inconsistent with the refusal
                            to boycott the Montreal games in 1976, but Senegal would not influence
                            others to go to Moscow. He said that he advocated a change of venue—to
                            give the games a permanent home in Greece. (S)</p>
                        <p>The President responded that there was an honest disagreement over the
                            Olympics, and that he felt the Soviet people will interpret attendance
                            as an endorsement of aggression in Afghanistan. He asked Senghor to keep
                            an open mind on the issue. (S)</p>
                        <p>Senghor responded that he would do everything possible to support the
                            President short of an actual boycott. (S)</p>
                        <p>Senghor expressed his concern about Soviet and Cuban efforts to subvert
                            African nations. He said that U.S. assistance for Morocco and Tunisia
                            was helpful, and he hoped that the U.S. would give military aid to
                            African nations willing to stand up to Soviet aggression. He noted that
                            while it was desirable for all foreign military forces to leave
                            Africa,—the 60,000 Communist troops and the 15,000 Western military
                            alike,—this was impossible because the pro-Communist African governments
                            need foreign Communist troops to stay in power. (S)</p>
                        <p>The President expressed the hope that Senghor would continue his efforts
                            in the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> to rid the Continent of
                            foreign troops. (S)</p>
                        <p>Senghor turned to the problem of Western Sahara, and noted that he is
                            working hard for a compromise. He said he was hopeful that Algeria would
                            listen to suggestions for a settlement. (S)</p>
                        <p>Finally, Senghor noted that he had met World Bank President <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRS_1">McNamara</persName> the previous day, and that he
                            hoped the U.S. Congress would be supportive of the work of the Bank.
                            (S)</p>
                        <p>The President endorsed Senghor’s hope, but noted that it is not always a
                            simple matter to persuade the Congress to be entirely cooperative.
                            (S)</p>
                        <p>The President thanked President Senghor for calling on him, and they
                            exchanged farewells. (U)</p>

                        <p>A. Monrovia, Liberia (<gloss target="#t_UPI_1">UPI</gloss>)—Liberian
                            President <persName corresp="#p_TWR_1">William Tolbert</persName> was
                            assassinated in a pre-dawn coup by army enlisted men who seized control
                            of the capital before dawn Saturday, citing “rampant corruption by the
                            government.”</p>
                        <p>B. An announcement over Monrovia radio station said the coup had been led
                            by Master Sgt. Samuel K. Doe, 28, who said, “the army will conduct the
                            affairs of the country until a decision has been reached” about future
                            administration.</p>
                        <p>C. Doe disclosed to the Liberian news agency that <persName

                                <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> had been killed. There were
                            reports of other fatalities, but no figures were available.</p>
                        <p>D. The army sergeant said his “Army Redemption Council” seized power in
                            the West African nation of 1.7 million people “because of rampant
                            corruption and continuous failure by the government to effectively
                            handle the affairs of the people.”</p>
                        <p>E. Crowds of Liberians thronged streets of the capital despite orders for
                            a 24-hour curfew. Green-uniformed soldiers fired their weapons into the
                            air in celebration and commandeered vehicles to ride through the
                            streets.</p>
                        <p>F. Communications with the outside world were cut and flights in and out
                            of the country suspended.</p>
                        <p>G. Automatic weapons fire broke out at <persName corresp="#p_TWR_1"
                                >Tolbert</persName>’s five-story official mansion housing his
                            offices and residence about two hours after midnight. There was sporadic
                            firing around military installations in the city until shortly after
                            dawn and Doe announced his takeover at 6:30 a.m.</p>
                        <p>H. Doe ordered a number of senior government and military officials to
                            report to the mansion and also requested an immediate meeting with
                            American and Soviet diplomatic representatives at <persName

                        <p>This paper examines the likely characteristics of the future government
                            leaders of seven West African countries—Senegal, The Gambia, Guinea,
                            Sierra Leone, Liberia, Ivory Coast, and Cameroon. It assumes most
                            political change will be evolutionary, building on past experience and
                            drawing new leadership from within existing systems. That assumption is
                            necessary for analytic purposes, but evolutionary change <pb n="165"
                                facs="0197" xml:id="pg_165"/>is not a foregone conclusion, as the
                            coup in Liberia on 12 April illustrates.<note n="2" xml:id="d57fn2">See

                            differences investigated in this study will play an important role in
                            shaping future governments in West Africa. [<hi rend="italic">portion

                        <p>Most of the incumbent presidents have been in power since these countries
                            became independent, and turnover at the top will affect the timing and
                            manner of changes at other levels. Although there may be interim
                            arrangements in some cases, it appears likely that West Africa will skip
                            a generation when it makes its transition to new leadership. There would
                            seem to be little future for the middle-aged group that has been
                            overshadowed by the generation that led the way to independence. Within
                            a few years we expect to see younger people, now in their thirties and
                            forties, whose ideas have been formed since independence move into
                            positions of authority throughout the area. [<hi rend="italic">portion
                                marking not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>These young leaders are nominal members of the ruling party, as this is
                            generally expected of officeholders, but few are really active in party
                            affairs and even fewer have indicated that they entertain presidential
                            ambitions. Although in most West African societies it is considered bad
                            form to discuss the possibility of change at the top, the reluctance of
                            the young leaders to do so probably indicates a genuine lack of interest
                            in political competition. When they do express views, they deplore the
                            uncertainty and risk that comes with playing politics. In most
                            instances, their aim is to do well in their careers and to ensure a
                            comfortable standard of living for themselves and their families. [<hi

                        <p>As these West African countries have matured, their elites have grown
                            more similar. There has been an influx into key positions of young
                            people from outlying areas where colonial influences are weaker and
                            where tribal affiliations cross national boundaries. Open borders and
                            frequent multinational meetings strengthen regional ties—a trend
                            recently reinforced by the return of Guinea to an active role in
                                Africa.<note n="3" xml:id="d57fn3">See <ref target="#d47">Document

                        <p>Coming administrations probably will be directed by highly educated
                            Africans. They will have well-developed technical and managerial skills
                            and yet be deeply rooted in African life. These potential leaders are
                            professionally oriented people who show relatively little interest in
                            ideology or in political careers per se. [<hi rend="italic">portion

                        <p><pb n="166" facs="0198" xml:id="pg_166"/>Under this second generation
                            leadership, policy is likely to be increasingly shaped by a permanent
                            civil service dedicated to solving the practical problems of
                            nation-building, economic development, and regional cooperation.
                            Although a strong presidential figure and a party apparatus will
                            continue to mobilize the population in support of political goals, the
                            dominance of party and president seems likely to diminish. [<hi

                        <p>These countries are branching out from residual dependence on their
                            former colonial rulers and turning more frequently to international
                            organizations to meet development needs that are looming larger in their
                            policy planning. They also are moving toward more formal inter-African
                            cooperation with a variety of regional organizations that cross the old
                            English- and French-speaking lines. [<hi rend="italic">portion marking
                                not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>Collectively these seven countries occupy the part of Sub-Saharan Africa
                            that is geographically closest to the United States and Western Europe.
                            They are generally pro-Western and have relatively open political
                            systems. Although all of them are classified as less developed
                            countries, their economies function relatively well, and several have
                            considerable undeveloped resources. Although a severe economic setback
                            could upset their stability, their political systems seem securely
                            enough rooted to survive in normal conditions. Because they have been
                            relatively friendly and trouble free, these countries have only
                            infrequently come to the attention of US policymakers. For that reason,
                            the new generation coming to prominence is not well known in the United
                            States, and there is some risk that this unfamiliarity could cause
                            problems in future US dealings with them. [<hi rend="italic">portion

                                corresp="#p_SRP_1">Smith</persName> saw Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_MGB_1">Matthews</persName> who had been receptive to our
                            concerns up to this point. On this occasion, it appeared that <persName
                                corresp="#p_MGB_1">Matthews</persName> had no authority in the
                            deliberations over executions. He seemed unable to influence the
                            decision of the Peoples’ Redemption Council (<gloss target="#t_PRC_1"
                                >PRC</gloss>). The <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> members are
                            inexperienced and basically illiterate, non-commissioned officers. The
                            civilians are not in control and it is unclear exactly what control Sgt.
                            Doe exercises himself. The Embassy expects more executions sometime this
                            weekend. Our Ambassador has been attempting to see Sgt. Doe since
                            yesterday, but as of yet has been unsuccessful. (S)</p>
                        <p>I must stress that at no time have Americans or foreigners been the
                            explicit objects of violence. Hostility and violence has been directed,
                            for the most part, toward members of the former ruling elite. Currently,
                            there are 80 people in confinement. The Embassy is concerned that we not
                            give the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> any impression that the
                            U.S. opposes this revolution, or is in any way hostile to the new
                            rulers. Most importantly, we must avoid giving any impression that we
                            are involved in any counter-coup planning. The <gloss target="#t_PRC_1"
                                >PRC</gloss> is in an intensely paranoid state and our Ambassador is
                            furthermore reluctant to evacuate Americans because it may imply our
                            opposition to the regime and spark a reaction. (S)</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SRP_1">Smith</persName> views any
                            presentation to the <gloss target="#t_GOL_1">GOL</gloss> on the
                            asylum/deportation idea as imprudent. But he would like to begin moving
                            on military contingency planning and would hope that a cover story for
                            any military movement could be devised. Any public knowledge that
                            American military planning was ongoing would have deleterious effects on
                            the situation in Monrovia. (S)</p>

                            the available information, that the Ambassador has not made a choice as

                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_HWC_1">Harrop</persName></hi>. I

                                xml:id="pg_169"/>shed some light on this. In response to a general
                            question about evacuation preparation, Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_SRP_1">Smith</persName> said:</p>
                        <p>“We share concern at lengthy military lead time and recommend that forces
                            be placed on alert. Even if alert status leaked, given other areas of
                            crisis in the world, unless ground is carefully prepared here, news of
                            alert could put us in jeopardy.</p>
                        <p>“We concur in despatch of <gloss target="#t_LPH_1">LPH</gloss> helicopter
                            ships as well as placing airborne force on alert. Ship should have
                            ability to communicate with Embassy in secure channel. We would not want
                            to explain this action to Doe now and hope cover story could be arranged
                            for its destination.</p>
                        <p>“We would like to come back to this important question later, but tend
                            now to believe that the dangers of formally entering the warning phase
                            of E and E plan outweigh the advantages. However, we plan to take many
                            of the actions called for in the warning phase quietly. We can also take
                            additional steps to reduce numbers of Americans slowly.” (S)</p>

                            concerned that once executions begin again, they will be most difficult
                            to stop. There are two factors to keep in mind. First, the group in
                            control does not understand diplomatic niceties. Diplomacy, in fact, is
                            almost irrelevant. Second, the government is totally unpredictable and
                            may act in ways which we would normally not expect. [<hi rend="italic"

                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_OWE_1">Odom</persName></hi>. A
                            more explicit question is what are the immediate causes of these events?
                            (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Cowan</hi>. There are two explanations: One is that it
                            was a spontaneous act of a group of people sitting around and drinking
                            beer. The other, which is unconfirmed and more unlikely, is that this
                            had been in the works for almost a year. (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_OWE_1">Odom</persName></hi>. It
                            seems to me that the spontaneous explanation is less than compelling
                            because sustained executions require some degree of planning. (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Cowan</hi>. Basically, it comes down to upcountry
                            Liberians out to get their oppressors of 133 years. (S)</p>

                                    corresp="#p_OWE_1">Odom</persName></hi>. There is no other
                            evidence of foreign involvement? Is there no credence to reports that
                            the Soviet Embassy was involved? (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Cowan</hi>. No, there is not, but there is potential
                            for Soviet advantage. We are also concerned about possible demonstration
                            effects in Sierra Leone and elsewhere on the Continent. (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_OWE_1">Odom</persName></hi>. Are

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Lt. Col. Val Johnson</hi>. 5,000 men, 5 of 100mm
                            artillery pieces, some mortars, light machinery. We estimate it would
                            take as little as 200 American troops to take over. (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_OWE_1">Odom</persName></hi>. But
                            how organized are they? How large are the opposing forces? (S)</p>

                            breakdown in command and control. There are bands of armed privates,
                            corporals and sergeants roaming around. What we are trying to do now is
                            just maintain liaison with the military authorities. (S)</p>

                            we be faced with? We need to tighten up our data base. Now, what about
                            Sierra Leone and Ivory Coast? To what extent would these countries be
                            good for exfiltration? Is it worthwhile investigating this route? Will
                            Americans attempting to escape across the border be prevented from
                            leaving? (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Borg</hi>. People who are upcountry could get across
                            the border because it is quite permeable. (S)</p>

                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_OWE_1">Odom</persName></hi>. O.K.
                            I just wanted to bring it out and discover whether anyone thinks that
                            this type of consideration should have any bearing on decision-making on
                            evacuation. (S)</p>

                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_OWE_1">Odom</persName></hi>. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HWC_1">Harrop</persName>, can you present the
                            three options which you brought along? (U)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_HWC_1">Harrop</persName></hi>.
                            Option 1 calls for quiet departure by commercial carriers of
                            non-essential American personnel, both private and official, and
                            dependents. Option 2 is to place on alert U.S. aircraft, personnel and
                            equipment required to land one battalion of men in Monrovia, as well as
                            instructing an <gloss target="#t_LPH_1">LPH</gloss> to proceed to the
                            area. Option 3 is to approach Sgt. Doe and inform him that we would like
                            to gradually and temporar<pb n="172" facs="0204" xml:id="pg_172"/>ily
                            reduce the number of Americans in the country and ask for Liberian
                            support, making it clear that this in no way implies disapproval of the
                            Liberian government. (S)</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador is proceeding in a limited way with Option 1. Because of
                            his concern about raising suspicions in the <gloss target="#t_GOL_1"
                                >GOL</gloss>, he is not in a position to issue travel orders for
                            American personnel. (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_OWE_1">Odom</persName></hi>. I
                            take it that State does not support Option 3. (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_HWC_1">Harrop</persName></hi>.
                            State does not have a firm position at this point. The Secretary wants
                            to have a consideration of all the available options. (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Johnson</hi>. The options do not appear to be mutually
                            incompatible. (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_OWE_1">Odom</persName></hi>. The
                            essential choice is whether or not to announce to Doe our intention to
                            draw down. (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_HWC_1">Harrop</persName></hi>.
                            That is the crucial question. (U)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_OWE_1">Odom</persName></hi>. Then
                            how far should we go with military preparation? (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_HWC_1">Harrop</persName></hi>. If
                            we ask for Doe’s support, then we should tell him about the military
                            preparation. The only way a draw down using commercial air or shipping
                            is feasible, is with the cooperation of the government. (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_OWE_1">Odom</persName></hi>. Then
                            we have an implicit choice as to whether we move more rapidly or slowly.
                            There appears then to be two dimensions to the problem. (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_HWC_1">Harrop</persName></hi>.
                            Yes, if we do not go to the government, then we must go slow. (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">James Woods</hi>. A question on the facts. Yesterday at
                            the <gloss target="#t_IG_1">IG</gloss> we heard a figure of 4800
                            Americans in Liberia. The Mission has come back with a figure of about
                            3800. There are a lot of missionaries in Liberia. Do these figures
                            include them or not? (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_HWC_1">Harrop</persName></hi>. We
                            have to clarify the numbers and will do so. (U)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Borg</hi>. There is also a large category of Americans
                            who are married to Liberians, but who are still legally American
                            citizens. We would have to deal with them as well. (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Woods</hi>. It seems that we would not want to go with
                            option 3. It could trigger a scenario we are trying to avoid. (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_HWC_1">Harrop</persName></hi>.
                            That is quite true. (U)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Cowan</hi>. And what happens if he says no? (U)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_HWC_1">Harrop</persName></hi>.
                            Before we finish this discussion we should consider the problem of
                            leaks. In the 1980’s we cannot operate without this factor. If leaks are
                            inevitable and Sgt. Doe and the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>
                            learn of our military preparations, we could indeed bring on the
                            scenario we are trying to avoid. (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">General Granger</hi>. I think that the preferred way is
                            the commercial evacuation option. (U)</p>
                        <p><pb n="173" facs="0205" xml:id="pg_173"/><hi rend="italic"><persName
                                    corresp="#p_HWC_1">Harrop</persName></hi>. It is the
                            Ambassador’s judgment that evacuation must be done carefully, if at all,
                            and it would be most imprudent to do anything to alienate the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOL_1">GOL</gloss> at this time. There are considerable
                            problems with harassment by unruly soldiers at the airport, a difficult
                            hour-long drive to the airport, and the fact that the first battalion
                            camp of Liberian troops is along the way. And, we don’t have much play
                            in option 1. (U)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Borg</hi>. There are only two flights a week by PanAm
                            and we have got to know how many other scheduled flights are flying.
                            (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_OWE_1">Odom</persName></hi>. What
                            are the <gloss target="#t_JCS_1">JCS</gloss> reactions to these options?
                            (U)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">General Granger</hi>. There appear to be a large number
                            of scheduled flights in and out of Monrovia on different commercial
                            carriers. (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_HWC_1">Harrop</persName></hi>.
                            Aggregating people in the first phase of evacuation would be difficult
                            and may cause some panic. (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Johnson</hi>. Right now we are in the planning phase.
                            The next stage is issuance of a warning order for detailed planning. We
                            have not done the detailed plans as of yet. (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_HWC_1">Harrop</persName></hi>.
                            What kind of mobility would troops have when there? (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Johnson</hi>. They would be mobile with five days of
                            supplies. It would take 14 C–141’s to bring the battalion in. We have an
                                <gloss target="#t_LPH_1">LPH</gloss> in the Mediterranean which has
                            just left Turkey and is heading toward France. Once it is in position
                            off the coast of <persName corresp="#p_SJW_1">Spain</persName>, it will
                            be six days time to Monrovia. (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_HWC_1">Harrop</persName></hi>.
                            How long would it be to Monrovia as of today? (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Johnson</hi>. Twelve days and each day it gets closer.
                            The <gloss target="#t_LPH_1">LPH</gloss> could handle the situation. It
                            has 1100 Marines on board and could handle evacuees for a very short
                            time, perhaps 24 hours. Since it takes two days to Dakar, there would
                            have to be some other way of dealing with the evacuees. (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Isom</hi>. Basically, a reinforced company could take
                            the airport without any problem. A battalion could probably secure the
                            road from Monrovia to the airport. (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_OWE_1">Odom</persName></hi>. Can
                            we send anything else along with it to receive the evacuees? (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Johnson</hi>. We will look into that. (U)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_OWE_1">Odom</persName></hi>. It
                            would be useful to raise a question internally at <gloss

                            put into port. We also need to know what types of internal resistance
                            that would be encountered and the feasibility of ground movement. We
                            have to take a look at the country in detail and <gloss

                            we might run into. Before taking any of this to the President, we need a

                        <p>The meeting focused on our relations with the new government. It was
                            noted that while the new regime had, in response to our strong
                            demarches, moderated its original harsh policy on executions and had
                            begun to establish some internal stability, its inexperience had made
                            its viability far from certain.<note n="2" xml:id="d59fn2">See <ref

                                the Government of Liberia conveying the concern of the U.S.
                                Government that the accused members of the former government be
                                “assured due process,” that “executions have shocked the American
                                public,” and that “such acts will certainly have serious
                                repercussions” on how the world views the new Liberian government.

                            our political, economic and strategic interests in Liberia, including
                            important communication facilities, considerable economic investment,
                            access to air and port facilities, and some 4,000 American citizens. It
                            was recognized that while we have not received requests for large-scale
                            assistance as yet, the likelihood is that the Liberian economy will
                            deteriorate badly rather quickly, and such appeals for economic aid can
                            be expected in the coming months. (S)</p>

                        <p>It was agreed that:</p>
                        <p>—We should augment our present relationship with the new government

                        <p>—We should reaffirm our present policy of not granting asylum requests

                            humanitarian reasons in extreme or exceptional circumstances, where the

                            statement concerning our obvious political, economic and strategic
                            interests in Liberia, noting the extensive communication facilities, the

                            of some 4,000 U.S. citizens. He said that it was his personal judgment
                            that the position of the Doe Government remains somewhat precarious and
                            tenuous. He asked <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> for its

                            to note that there was recent evidence to suggest a growing interest in
                            Liberia on the part of both Ethiopia and Libya. He judged that Doe would
                            respond to this interest in a manner dependent upon our ability to be

                            briefly outlined the three basic options,—to distance ourselves from the
                            Doe Government, to maintain the present relationship, or to augment the
                            present relationship. He noted a preference for option
                            three,—augmentation, but pointed out that this was easier to state than
                            to fund, given our scarce resources. (S)</p>

                            we were faced with a terribly weak leadership in the new government, but
                            that it was all we had to work with. (S)</p>

                            of continuing with the Presidential Commission on U.S.-Liberian

                            said that the Commission had been “put on hold” for now, but that
                            Chairman Gray had expressed an interest in going to Liberia with one or
                            two others,—perhaps Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MRM_1"
                                >Moose</persName> and <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> staffer

                            supported the Chairman’s idea, but pointed out that this would require
                            much groundwork with the Doe people so as to avoid raising false
                            expectations. (U)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_FG_1">Funk</persName></hi> agreed
                            with Gray’s suggestions, as well as <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1"
                                >Newsom</persName>’s caveat, but also pointed out that in his
                            discussions with Chairman Gray, Gray had expressed a desire to have at
                            least one other Commission member go along,—perhaps Andrew Brimmer.

                            being no disagreement, Gray and a few select people should travel to
                            Liberia, but as a “special delegation” rather than as a Commission.

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Claytor</hi> said that should the presently moderating

                            to lift the present ban on lethal items, but that while the Liberian
                            army was requesting resupply of ammunition, this request should be
                            answered only after a thorough research of actual needs. (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Pelletreau</hi> noted the urgent request for $500,000

                                >FMS</gloss>, but stated his strong reservations. (S)</p>

                            noted that we should not rush to do so, as we could expect to have
                            increasing claims put upon these dwindling resources in the months

                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_FG_1">Funk</persName></hi> noted
                            the desirability of such a program for Liberia, given the continuing
                            basic “rice crisis” facing the country, but said that such a program
                            would have to be weighed carefully on other African claimants to a

                            agreement on the desirability of trying to be responsive to what can be

                            of reprogramming which would not do serious harm to other vital

                            suggested that it would be useful to encourage the availability of sound
                            economic advice, on a technical rather than a political basis,—perhaps

                            and guidance would be helpful in sending reassuring signals to the

                            strategy with Congress, suggesting that we should continue to keep
                            Congressman Gray and Congressman Solarz and other key members of the
                            House and Senate fully informed. All agreed. (U)</p>

                                >Christopher</persName></hi> asked for ideas on evacuation, stating
                            a preference for continued low-profile voluntary evacuation of
                            dependents and non-essential people. (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Claytor</hi> supported this continuation of this

                            continuing basis, and noted that a helicopter ship would remain in the

                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName></hi>
                            asked that the possibility of direct sea evacuation, in cooperation with
                            commercial lines, not be overlooked. (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Pustay</hi> said that <gloss target="#t_JCS_1"

                            of muted public criticism, coupled with direct and forceful admonitions
                            to the Doe regime to initiate and maintain a policy of respect for human
                            rights and rule of law. There was complete agreement on this point.

                            outlined the concerns which had been raised on the Hill, particularly by
                            Congressman Solarz, with respect to the late Foreign Minister <persName

                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_FG_1">Funk</persName></hi> stated
                            a preference for maintaining our present policy of not granting asylum
                            in a foreign jurisdiction except for temporary refuge in extreme

                            then noted that so far there was a general coolness to the Doe
                            Government on the part of other African governments, and asked if there
                            might be some impact on our relations with these other Africans, should

                            far in support of a government which was obviously bringing more chaos

                            there was a three-part covert action proposal on Liberia to be
                            considered, and it was his understanding that there would be little
                            discussion on parts two and three, with somewhat more discussion on item
                            one. He therefore suggested we work backwards, taking the first item
                            last. He then summarized the three-part proposal:</p>

                            said that State had no objections to items two and three,—security
                            liaison and propaganda. (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Admiral Murphy</hi> asked what safeguards there were to
                            the security liaison proposal, noting that the creation of a very

                            provide some measure of personal protection for the executive, [<hi

                            a police operation. He said that we all knew there could be no absolute
                            guarantees, but that the best guarantee was our presence. [<hi

                            or question, the meeting approved items two and three;—security liaison
                            and propaganda,—and asked for discussion on item one, providing

                            asked for some elaboration on the proposal, and said that it was not
                            clear if it was offered in response to <gloss target="#t_GOL_1"

                        <p>The leadership of the Government of Liberia is frightened and confused by
                            the problems it is facing, and it is operating on two distinct
                            levels—the Military Peoples Redemption Council seeing one set of
                            problems, and the Cabinet (and civil servants), another. But all agree
                            that they need help, desperately, and that they want this help to come
                            from the US—their “first and best friend.”</p>
                        <p>We (Congressman Gray, Asst. Sec. <persName corresp="#p_MRM_1"
                                >Moose</persName> and I) talked to virtually the entire Cabinet and
                            top civil servants several times over 3 days, met with Doe twice, and
                            with the entire <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>! In all that time
                            there was no threat to move toward the Libyans, Ethiopians, Cubans and
                            Soviets, but it is painfully clear that if they don’t get the help they
                            need to survive from us, they will take that help from any source.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>’s
                            View</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> has been expanded from the
                            original 17 to include an additional 11 “associate members”—thus
                            allowing for marginally better tribal balance, and a mechanism for
                            denoting some of the more hopeless incompetents from the all-powerful 17
                            who act as executive and legislature. Doe and his top 3/4 people are
                            intelligent and highly motivated to bring honest reform, but they have
                            the equivalent of perhaps a 5th grade education. They are clearly
                            popular, for now, but they seem to realize this will change rapidly if
                            they can’t deliver.</p>
                        <p>They are focused on two problems—the desperate need for military housing
                            (as requested by <persName corresp="#p_TWR_1">Tolbert</persName> when he
                            saw the President last year),<note n="2" xml:id="d62fn2">See <ref
                                    target="#d49">Document 49</ref>.</note> and the hostility of
                            their neighbors, which they blow all out of proportion.</p>
                        <p><pb n="188" facs="0220" xml:id="pg_188"/>Thus, Doe and his immediate
                            circle are asking for housing aid, and modest military help—trucks,
                            radios, some small arms. We are answering the military needs. But the
                            housing will require a program of $10 million a year for four years.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Cabinet’s View</p>
                        <p>The Cabinet, which is dominated by Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_MGB_1">Matthews</persName>, Planning Minister Tipoth,
                            Justice Minister Cheapoo and Financial Advisor Tarr—is focused on the
                            real and crucial immediate problem: how to maintain financial liquidity.
                            They were left with $5 million in the bank and a shortfall of $25
                            million at the end of the fiscal year, June 30. (The <persName
                                corresp="#p_TWR_1">Tolbert</persName> government would have faced
                            the same problem, but with a line of commercial credit to carry them
                            over the year end.)</p>
                        <p>Once through this credit crunch, the Cabinet sees a need to get on with
                            the military housing—as they feel that will ensure the <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>’s early return to the barracks.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Policy Statements</p>
                        <p>The Cabinet has issued political and policy statements which we can live
                            with—“true non-alignment,” honoring all existing agreements, maintaining
                            free enterprise system, etc. The human rights situation is not great,
                            but steadily and clearly improving.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">What Do We Need to Do?</p>
                        <p>We have already shown our good will and won a large measure of confidence
                            from both the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> and the Cabinet by
                            being responsive to the immediate needs of the military ($2.5 in <gloss

                            economy and quite probably the political system will cave in. We can be
                            certain the Soviets and friends will scavenge the remains.</p>

                        <p>Senghor said that <persName corresp="#p_NSD_1">Sam Nujoma</persName> can
                            be influenced in favor of moderation. “We will make him a social
                            democrat and keep him out of the Soviets arms.” Senghor said the African
                            moderates are insisting on a free election in Namibia along the lines of
                            Zimbabwe. <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss> should not take power

                            negotiations with South Africa. Senghor replied that he supports the
                            efforts of the Western contact group, but that South Africa will not go
                            along unless pressure is applied. Senghor said that an immediate oil <pb

                            reconciliation with <persName corresp="#p_SJ_1">Savimbi</persName>, but
                            the Soviets stopped that development by killing <persName

                            said he supports <persName corresp="#p_SJ_1">Savimbi</persName> because

                        <p>Senghor prefaced his remarks by saying he does not want to appear
                            anti-semitic. He said that his two children by his first marriage have
                                <pb n="191" facs="0223" xml:id="pg_191"/>Jewish blood through their
                            mother. One of his sons is engaged to a Dutch woman of the Jewish faith.
                            Senghor said he gets along well with Simon Peres of the Labor Party. But
                            Begin is an extremist; there will be no hope for Palestinian autonomy as
                            long as Begin is Prime Minister. The Israelis have to decide they are a
                            Middle Eastern people, and not a European people. Senghor said he
                            supports the Camp David Agreement. Senegal has never failed to oppose
                            efforts to condemn Sadat in international conferences.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President said the U.S. is grateful for Senegal’s support, and
                            we hope it will continue. The Vice President said one of the problems in
                            reaching an agreement on Palestinian autonomy is Israel’s sense of
                            isolation. The Africans broke relations with Israel because of Egypt’s
                            requests in 1967 and 1973. Now that Egypt has resumed relations with
                            Israel, isn’t it time for the Africans to do the same. President Senghor
                            implied that the question was premature, and began a discussion of
                            Libya. He said that Senegal broke relations with Libya because
                            Senegalese citizens had been enticed to go there for military
                            training.</p>

                        <p>Senghor said he was upset with <persName corresp="#p_GdV_1">Giscard
                                d’Estaing</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SH_1">Helmut

                            Afghanistan and Iran. He said that Africa cannot be expected to resist
                            communist penetration if the West is reacting so weakly to the Soviet
                            threat. Senghor said he mentioned this to both Giscard and <persName

                        <p>The Vice President replied that the U.S. was disappointed in its European
                            allies, and said he was pleased that Senghor had made his displeasure
                            known to them.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">North-South Dialogue</p>
                        <p>Senghor said that the Sahel countries can solve the problem of
                            desertification only through the construction of dams. The dams needed
                            to save Senegal alone will cost one trillion dollars by the year 2020.
                            It will be impossible to achieve these objectives if the industrialized
                            countries do not follow the World Bank recommendation to donate 0.7
                            percent of their <gloss target="#t_GNP_1">GNP</gloss>’s to economic
                            assistance. He cited figures to show that Europe is donating only 0.30
                            percent of <gloss target="#t_GNP_1">GNP</gloss>, and the U.S. only 0.25
                            percent. He pleaded for greater understanding.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President pointed out that President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> has consistently asked Congress
                            to increase foreign aid. But Congress has found it difficult to do so in
                            view of the needs of the poor in the U.S.</p>

                            these as preferable to an embargo which might prompt Libya to seize
                            Niger’s uranium mines. He predicted a 60 million dls shortfall due to
                            lower uranium prices in the 300 million dls revenue foreseen in Niger’s
                            current budget, and he asked for American assistance. Pessimistic about
                            the Chadian situation, he endorsed the concept of a <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> peacekeeping force. He said Niger has
                            not recognized the Polisario’s claims because their acknowledgement
                            would encourage other groups within the Sahara to contest the legitimacy
                            of recognized international borders. The Vice President outlined Western
                            concerns provoked by the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and described
                            some of the defensive measures being undertaken by the United States and
                            its allies. End summary.</p>

                        <p>2. Vice President <persName corresp="#p_MWF_1">Mondale</persName> met
                            with President Shagari for about a half an hour on Tuesday morning, July
                            22. The initial welcome by President Shagari and response by the Vice
                            President were attended by the press and the Vice President’s party.
                            Following this the press and non-official members of the party
                            withdrew.</p>
                        <p>3. The Vice President passed on to President Shagari President <persName

                            meet with him in early October when President Shagari was visiting the
                                <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss>. Because of President
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>’s busy campaign
                            schedule it was difficult to tie down an exact time but this could be
                            worked out by the ambassadors.</p>
                        <p>4. President Shagari again welcomed the Vice President noting this
                            obvious further demonstration of U.S. interest in Nigeria following
                            President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>’s visit in

                            support for Nigeria’s democratic constitutional development and was
                            pleased with the evident seriousness with which we were approaching the
                            economic talks.</p>
                        <p><pb n="194" facs="0226" xml:id="pg_194"/>5. The President said that the
                            Nigerian people needed some clear-cut identification of America with its
                            development progress. The British and Europeans and Japanese were
                            associated with the country’s industrial development. The Soviets had
                            undertaken to assist with its steel industry. Nigeria is determined to
                            do something about agriculture and the President said he believed the
                            U.S. should devote its efforts to that sector. The second area of
                            involvement should be energy development. He would like to see the U.S.
                            make an impact in the oil and petrochemical industry so that Americans
                            could be clearly identified with this sector.</p>
                        <p>6. The President said that he would also like to see Americans associated
                            with Nigerian constitutional development. The country is still
                            experimenting with its structure. If it succeeds it will set an example
                            towards which the rest of Africa will look.</p>
                        <p>7. The Vice President responded that America was thrilled by the
                            restoration of democracy in Nigeria, and particularly impressed that it
                            had chosen a constitutional structure similar in many ways to our own.
                            He assured the President of our immediate response if there was any way
                            in which we could be helpful in this regard.</p>
                        <p>8. As to the bilateral talks the Vice President said he had brought a
                            high-level delegation of men and women who were capable of making
                            decisions on the spot and wanted to see concrete results. The Vice
                            President said we fully support the priority which Nigeria gives to
                            agriculture. If oil is its biggest asset, its dependence on foreign
                            agriculture is its greatest liability. Farmers are the most stable
                            element of society. The Vice President noted that he had brought
                            Undersecretary Hathaway with him for discussions on agriculture and that
                            we are prepared to sign a memorandum of understanding which covered
                            detailed areas of cooperation. He described some of the areas. On
                            energy, Undersecretary Sawhill was prepared to contribute to the success
                            of the meeting. We had no disagreement on any of this. The President
                            agreed that there were no disagreements; we just needed
                            accomplishments.</p>
                        <p>9. The Vice President then reviewed his written list of projects we are
                            preparing. He mentioned soil conservation, trade and development and our
                            interest in science and technology. Here he noted that President
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> wanted to send his
                            science advisor, <persName corresp="#p_PF_1">Frank Press</persName>, and
                            a group of our leading scientists to Nigeria in September to discuss
                            cooperation in that area. He noted student exchanges in education and
                            pledged that we would try to do a better job in getting rid of
                            unnecessary obstacles. We are hoping for instance to be able to permit
                            Nigerian students to obtain multiple entry visas.</p>
                        <p>10. The President said he was impressed with this very concrete list of
                            proposals and acknowledged that the ball was in the Nigerians <pb

                        <p>Prime Minister Pires welcomed the Vice President, saying that he was most
                            honored and gratified to receive him in Cape Verde, particularly in view
                            of the special relationship that exists between our two countries owing
                            to the many Cape Verdeans living in the U.S.</p>
                        <p>Pires regretted that the Vice President could stay so little time. He
                            would have wished him to visit the other islands, especially inasmuch as
                            Sal was not representative of the rest of the archipelago. He described
                            the topographic and climatic conditions of Cape Verde, referring in the
                            main to the drought. The Vice President was aware of the problem and
                            sympathetic about it, pointing to our own arid lands and the recent
                            drought that has ravaged our Southwest and Midwest.</p>
                        <p>Referring to the large Cape Verdean population in the U.S., the Vice
                            President asked if many returned to the islands to visit. Pires said a
                            fair number had traditionally come back to live once they were eligible
                                <pb n="196" facs="0228" xml:id="pg_196"/>for pensions, and that
                            since independence interest in the country had grown among the emigrants
                            more and more were returning as visitors.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President then told Pires that he had had good visits to
                            Senegal, Niger, and Nigeria,<note n="2" xml:id="d66fn2">See <ref
                                    target="#d63">Documents 63</ref>–<ref target="#d65"
                                >65</ref>.</note> where he had had comprehensive exchanges of views
                            with their leaders. During his talk with Pires, he especially wanted to
                            hear the Government of Cape Verde’s concerns, to know how our assistance
                            was working and what more we could do to help, since that was our
                            desire. He then hoped to hear Pires’ views on Angola, a country with
                            which we would like to have better relations. Since Cape Verde and
                            Angola shared a common history in their relationship to Portugal, he
                            knew that the Cape Verdeans understood the Angolans and he was
                            interested in what they thought we should do in relation to Angola.</p>
                        <p>Pires’ response to the first question was that their most pressing,
                            immediate worry was that the rains were very late in coming, as the Vice
                            President had no doubt already heard in Senegal.</p>
                        <p>On cooperation with the United States in general, he described it as
                            “quite good.” Extensive talks had been held with <gloss
                                target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> representatives in which the Cape
                            Verdeans had been able to describe their problems. A series of projects
                            were planned or under way, which Pires outlined briefly:</p>
                        <p>Two desalinization projects, one on Sao Vicente to expand and improve an
                            existing plant, and a new one on Sal, which had been delayed but thanks

                            Sal population, the airport, and the present and future hotel
                            facilities. He used the Sal project to make the general point of how
                            essential all water-related projects were to Cape Verde’s future,
                            equalled in importance only by finding means to meet the country’s
                            energy needs.</p>
                        <p>A brief general discussion followed on the economics of desalinization
                            and on non-conventional sources of energy.</p>
                        <p>Pires then resumed his description of the <gloss target="#t_AID_1"
                                >AID</gloss> program, mentioning the Tarrafal and Sao Tiago
                            agricultural and soil conservation projects, school construction, and
                            research on non-conventional energy sources. This prompted the Vice
                            President to ask an aide to invite Dr. John Sawhill of <gloss

                                praised Cape Verde’s non-alignment stance and program of economic

                        <p>Pires continued with his outline of the <gloss target="#t_AID_1"
                                >AID</gloss> program, saying how important the food assistance was
                            to his country. He described the operation of the National Development
                            Fund, stressing its value in creating employment and his government’s
                            philosophy in administering it, i.e. selling the food rather than giving
                            it away, so as not to create a “beggar mentality” among the people, and
                            then investing the proceeds in labor-intensive projects, particularly in
                            agriculture.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President informed Pires that the U.S. would be providing 5,000
                            tons of corn above the 10,000 already agreed upon, as soon as adequate
                            storage became available. Pires acknowledged that, adding that
                            discussions were in progress on the receipt of food assistance under
                            Title III. The <gloss target="#t_VP_1">VP</gloss> responded that we were
                            pleased to work with the Cape Verdeans on this, indicating how
                            complicated our legislation is.</p>
                        <p>At this point Dr. Sawhill arrived, and the conversation turned back to
                            energy. Pires described his country’s dependence on diesel-fueled
                            generators, their inability to effect economies of scale because the
                            islands were so small, and even to have an integrated power system on
                            each island. CV places great hope in eventually being able to use solar,
                            wind, and sea energy (the latter taking advantage of the differences in
                            temperature between the various layers of water). He described the newly
                            created Technical Research Institute which will be concentrating on such
                            forms of energy. The <gloss target="#t_GOCV_1">GOCV</gloss> has been in
                            touch with various European governments about the institute, and have
                            found the Swedes to be especially interested in helping. Also, the
                            Institute’s director was recently in the U.S. making contacts there.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Sawhill said the <gloss target="#t_DOE_1">DOE</gloss> would be happy
                            to receive the Director and to show him the various technologies we are
                            working on. Pires replied that the Institute was still being organized,
                            existing largely on paper and with few staff members. In any case, Dr.
                            Sawhill undertook to provide whatever documentation the Institute might
                            wish and to cooperate in other ways. Prime Minister Pires promised to
                            follow up on the offer.</p>
                        <p>Pires added that there was already a wind energy project with <gloss
                                target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> on Sao Tiago, and that Cape Verde was
                            also involved via <gloss target="#t_CILSS_1">CILSS</gloss> in some
                            regional energy activities that received U.S. assistance. In fact, it
                            was possible that the future <gloss target="#t_CILSS_1">CILSS</gloss>
                            center for research on non-conventional energy sources would be located
                            in Cape Verde.</p>
                        <p><pb n="198" facs="0230" xml:id="pg_198"/>The Vice President said that he
                            had been very impressed with his visit to the <gloss target="#t_CILSS_1"
                                >CILSS</gloss> Agrhymet center in Niamey, and told the Prime
                            Minister about the Cape Verdean trainees he had met there. The <gloss
                                target="#t_VP_1">VP</gloss> was pleased that Cape Verde was involved
                            in the <gloss target="#t_CILSS_1">CILSS</gloss> regional program, since
                            essentially the Sahel countries faced the same problems. That was true,
                            responded Pires, but Cape Verde’s situation was more complicated because
                            of its being made up of islands.</p>
                        <p>In connection with training, Pires informed the Vice President that there
                            were Cape Verdeans in the U.S. now being trained, mainly to work with
                            the <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> agriculture and irrigation
                            projects.</p>
                        <p>In summary, Pires said, there was broad cooperation between the U.S. and
                            Cape Verde, with which his government was pleased.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President then informed the Prime Minister that we would be
                            doubling our scholarship program, raising it from $100,000 to
                            $200,000.</p>
                        <p>At this point, the Vice President was notified that it was time to make
                            his departure statement, and the private meeting broke up. Before
                            leaving the VIP lounge, however, a quick conversation on Angola was
                            held, in which the other people in the room were included (some <gloss
                                target="#t_GOCV_1">GOCV</gloss> officials including Foreign Minister
                            Duarte, and, on our side, <persName corresp="#p_CAD_1">Denis

                            Torre).</p>
                        <p>Pires told the Vice President that prior to his arrival in Cape Verde the
                            Angolans had been in touch with the <gloss target="#t_GOCV_1"
                                >GOCV</gloss>. The Angolans were very concerned about finding a
                            solution to the whole Namibia-South Africa problem and with the latest
                            activity in the U.S. Congress on the Clark Amendment.<note n="5"
                                xml:id="d66fn5">The Clark amendment to the Arms Export Control Act
                                of 1976 forbade aid to groups involved in military operations in

                        <p>The Vice President said that he did not think the Senate modification of
                            the Clark Amendment had any chance of coming out of the House-Senate
                            conference. Even if it were approved, however, we had no intention of
                            changing our present policy and no intention of intervening in Angola.
                            What we wanted, simply, was that the parties there resolve their
                            differences peacefully.</p>
                        <p>Pires responded that the Angolans feel the problem of South Africa has to
                            be resolved; with that, the Namibian and other problems can be worked
                            out. The <gloss target="#t_VP_1">VP</gloss> asked if he did not mean
                            that the Namibian problem had to be resolved first. Pires acknowledged
                            that that was right, but that it was the South Africans who were
                            invading Angola.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President then stated that we hoped to be able to force South
                            Africa to agree to the holding of <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                            >UN</gloss>-supervised elections, which would allow for the creation of
                            a democratically elected government <pb n="199" facs="0231"
                                xml:id="pg_199"/>as was the case in Zimbabwe. This in turn would
                            provide justification for President dos Santos to have the Cubans leave
                            Angola. Pires answered that that was the Angolans’ position exactly.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President remarked that we have been working exceedingly hard on
                            the Namibian question. If Pires had any ideas on how we should be
                            dealing with the South Africans, we would welcome his advice. We are
                            doing what we can to pressure them to let go.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_LWA_1">Tony Lake</persName> added that we had been
                            working closely with Angola on the Namibia question. The first step had
                            to be an agreement on Namibia. With that settled, the big benefit would
                            be that it would reduce the reasons given for the Cuban presence in
                            Angola. Pires responded that the Angolans were very open to cooperation
                            on settling the Namibia problem. That, said Vice President <persName
                                corresp="#p_MWF_1">Mondale</persName>, was all the more reason for
                            us not to let up on our efforts there.</p>
                        <p>The meeting ended at this point, the Vice President delivered his
                            departure statement to the press in the public lounge, and then we went
                            out to the plane. There, Pires again expressed his great pleasure in
                            having met with the Vice President and asked him to come back and spend
                            more time in Cape Verde. The Vice President said he would be delighted
                            to do so.</p>

                            </list>
                            <p>This memorandum lists the initiatives which resulted from the Vice
                                President’s visit to West Africa July 16–23. There are four actions
                                which might require direct follow-up by the Vice President. Two of
                                these related to the establishment of the Joint Agricultural
                                Consultative Committee, which was one of the key areas of
                                concentration at the bilateral meetings in Lagos. We recommend that
                                the Vice President consider the following:</p>
                            <p>1. Sign a letter to Orville Freeman asking him to serve as the
                                Chairman of the Joint Agricultural Consultative Committee. The
                                Department has already discussed the Committee with Mr. Freeman but
                                nobody has yet asked him to be Chairman. A self-explanatory draft
                                letter which has been cleared by Agriculture Under Secretary
                                Hathaway is attached to this memorandum (Tab 1).</p>
                            <p>2. Sign a letter to <gloss target="#t_IDCA_1">IDCA</gloss> Director
                                Thomas Ehrlich requesting that <gloss target="#t_IDCA_1"
                                    >IDCA</gloss> consider funding the initial visit to Nigeria of
                                the members of the Joint Agricultural Consultative Committee
                                (scheduled for late this year or early next year) to identify
                                projects. <gloss target="#t_IDCA_1">IDCA</gloss> was originally very
                                forthcoming on this idea, but has recently shown signs of diminished
                                interest. A draft letter is also attached (Tab 2).</p>
                            <p>3. Secure a time on the President’s schedule for a meeting with
                                President Shagari of Nigeria. In response to the Vice President’s
                                invitation, President Shagari will arrive in Washington on the
                                morning of October 7 and depart that same evening for Nigeria. The
                                White House has been unable to provide a time for this meeting
                                because of the <pb n="202" facs="0234" xml:id="pg_202"
                                />uncertainties for the President’s schedule so far in advance.
                                Although recognizing that this is an election year, the Nigerians
                                are very sensitive about sufficient advance notification. In 1973
                                President Nixon kept Head of State Yakubu Gowon waiting for an
                                appointment that never materialized. This non-meeting contributed
                                substantially to a deterioration in relations with Nigeria. Both the
                                Ambassador in Washington and at the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                    >UN</gloss> have indicated that they would very much appreciate
                                early confirmation of an appointment time.</p>
                            <p>4. Debrief Israeli Ambassador Evron on the results of the visit. The
                                Israelis are very interested in the results of any conversations of
                                the Vice President regarding possible African moves toward the
                                reestablishment of relations with Israel. The Israeli Embassy
                                understood before the visit that the Vice President would urge
                                African leaders to consider these ties.</p>
                            <p>Following is the list of initiatives from the Vice President’s visit
                                with notes on the current status of each.</p>

                                and other international financial institutions. The Vice President
                                pledged that the U.S. would support Niger in its international
                                efforts to offset the revenue shortfall caused by the slump in
                                uranium prices. At about the same time, the <gloss target="#t_IMF_1"
                                    >IMF</gloss> approved a $7.1 million <gloss target="#t_SDR_1"
                                    >SDR</gloss> Trust Fund Loan. The State Department will remain
                                in close contact with Treasury on these questions.</p>
                            <p>D. Talks with Kountche. President Kountche suggested the Vice
                                President speak with the Nigerian President about the situation in
                                Chad and Liberia. Only Liberia was discussed with Foreign Minister
                                Audu during the visit to Lagos. The Department has forwarded a brief
                                summary of this conversation and that of Mr. <persName

                                to Monrovia for the Ambassador to use in his discussions with
                                President Kountche.</p>
                            <p>E. Uranium issues. Since the Vice President’s visit, we have been
                                notified that the Libyan Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (<gloss
                                    target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>) safeguards agreement entered into
                                force July 8, 1980. As a result the pressure is diminished on Niger
                                to cease its exports to Libya. Uranium shipped to Libya by Niger
                                will now be under safeguards pursuant to the safeguards agreement.
                                To facilitate the flow of information in this area Niger will
                                continue to record its exports in the <hi rend="italic">Official
                                    Journal</hi> and will begin to report directly to the <gloss

                            <p>F. Arms sales. President Kountche indicated that the Nigeriens would
                                be interested in purchasing military equipment from the United
                                States. There has been no subsequent discussion of this topic
                                between the Nigeriens and our Embassy.</p>
                            <p>G. Closer cooperation in the area of intelligence exchange. In
                                response to President Kountche’s request for cooperation in this
                                area, the Vice President agreed to send a senior intelligence
                                officer to Niamey to meet with President Kountche. A message about

                                for the Nigerian Ministry of Agriculture to identify priority
                                projects. The <gloss target="#t_FGN_1">FGN</gloss> ministry has
                                promised us this information by September 1. Quentin West or Dale

                                scientific and technical information in each area. They will also
                                include in some areas short-term visits by scientific and technical
                                persons from the two countries. They may also include temporary

                                them shortly. Specific follow-up actions on priority project areas
                                were also agreed upon. The Department is coordinating these actions

                                August 9, which was a form agreement more suitable for use with a
                                    non-<gloss target="#t_GATT_1">GATT</gloss> country; thus it is
                                not applicable to our purposes. The Trade Policy Committee is
                                drafting a new agreement incorporating some of the language from the
                                Nigerian draft. We expect to cable a draft to Lagos early in the
                                first week of September. The Nigerians have been informed of the
                                reasons for the delay.</p>
                            <p>10. The US agreed to support legislation for Congressional

                                for Nigeria. This must await outcome of negotiation of bilateral

                            <p>11. The US and the Nigerians agreed to resume negotiations on the
                                Bilateral Tax Treaty. The US proposed March 2 to resume
                                negotiations. The Nigerians have tentatively accepted this date.</p>
                            <p>12. The Nigerians agreed to notify <gloss target="#t_GATT_1"

                            <p>13. The Nigerians agreed to review their policy regarding issuance of
                                Multiple Entry Visas to businessmen and others. State and Commerce
                                are compiling information to provide the Nigerians with an update on
                                recent experiences of businessmen. The Nigerians agreed then to
                                review their policy. The Embassy will monitor this situation.</p>
                            <p>14. The Nigerians agreed to explore the possibility of centralizing
                                and simplifying the approvals process for foreign investors. The
                                Embassy will follow up by continuing to encourage such action.</p>
                            <p><pb n="207" facs="0239" xml:id="pg_207"/>15. The Nigerians agreed to

                            <p>1. Both sides agreed to act on the final agreement and signing of the

                                Nigerians. <gloss target="#t_IDCA_1">IDCA</gloss> is pursuing

                            <p>4. The US agreed to advise the Nigerians on criteria for issuance of
                                J–I visas for students. The Embassy and <gloss target="#t_ICA_1"

                            Welcome to the United States. You shoulder the burden both of President
                            of your country and Chairman of the Organization of African Unity. I
                            understand you made a good speech at the United Nations yesterday. I
                            value your friendship. I want you to know that you honor me by coming to
                            the White House to call on me. I would be interested in hearing your
                            views during this brief meeting of some of the issues which concern the
                                <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>. Congratulations also on your
                            75th birthday, your diamond birthday, which is particularly appropriate
                            because of the diamonds your country produces. Your vigor reminds me of
                            my mother who is in her 80’s and still extremely active. (C)</p>

                            this visit even more greatly appreciated. The first necessary quality
                            for a national leader is stamina because of the amount of energy needed
                            for all of the travel. I come as a friend of the United States and am
                            happy to be here. (C)</p>

                            neighbor, you should be able to explain the situation there better than

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Stevens:</hi> We are negotiating with the Secretary
                            General on these issues now. It is not an easy problem because of the
                            issue of colonial boundaries cutting across tribal boundaries. I am
                            planning to visit Chad myself. I have every hope for progress. With
                            regard to the Western Sahara, the Moroccans showed up for the first time
                            at an <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> Wisemen’s meeting. This was a
                            sign of progress, but they brought with them ten groups. The Wisemen
                            opposed listening to all of the Moroccan sponsored groups, but I
                            prevailed and insisted that they all be heard. The Moroccans said they
                            did not want a referendum, but I hope the Wisemen’s Committee members
                            can help. (C)</p>

                            What about the problems between Liberia and her neighbors? (C)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Stevens:</hi> In Liberia the colonial boundaries also
                            cut across tribal boundaries. Some of the Liberian tribes are the same
                            as those in Sierra Leone and Guinea. My mother is a Vai, a group which
                            lives on both sides of the border between the two countries. We have a
                            great interest in peace with Liberia. The Mano River Union is important
                            to us.<note n="4" xml:id="d68fn4">The Mano River Union was an agreement
                                reached in 1973 between Sierra Leone and Liberia to foster economic
                                ties between the two countries.</note> We have found that outside
                            powers pay greater attention to countries which are associated with this
                            sort of union. Later this month, we hope that <persName
                                corresp="#p_TAS_1">Sekou Toure</persName> will join us. At first I
                            was very skeptical about the new Liberian government, but I believe they
                            are now trying to set things straight. I had told the <persName
                                corresp="#p_TWR_1">Tolbert</persName> Government to try to get as
                            many people as possible involved in the government in order to create a
                            sense of belonging. He had responded that it was very difficult because
                            of some of the other people in his clique of important supporters. I
                            told him to go into the bush to seek support, but he did not. (C)</p>
                        <p>Master Sergeant Doe has written to <persName corresp="#p_TAS_1">Sekou
                                Toure</persName> to invite him to Monrovia in connection with Guinea
                            joining the Mano River Union. I am of course a little prejudiced because
                            of his past, but peace is most important. I recognize that this
                            invitation is part politics on the part of the Liberians but I will try
                            to convince <persName corresp="#p_TAS_1">Sekou Toure</persName> to
                            participate to promote stability in the region. These meetings are
                            difficult because of the problems of different languages. Shortly after
                            the coup I saw <persName corresp="#p_MGB_1">Matthews</persName> and told
                            him to watch the soldiers because when soldiers rule problems can
                            develop. They were unable to watch the soldiers and so good people got
                            killed. We are now in the process of normalizing relations. We are
                            trying to prevail on the Liberians to urge the military and civilians to
                            work together. If there is no cooperation, the civilian <pb n="211"
                                facs="0243" xml:id="pg_211"/>ministers are powerless. After
                            elections I have told them that they should all continue to try to work
                            together. (C)</p>

                            diplomatically, that is the business of other people. In Yamasoukro two
                            months ago, we found it hard to understand his English. At the airport
                            Senghor (sic) said that Master Sergeant Doe seemed to be a hostage
                            himself, judging from the soldiers around him. After the coup Doe made
                            foolish promises about quadrupling salaries of military. We realize,
                            however, that we must work with him. <persName corresp="#p_MGB_1"
                                >Matthews</persName> and Fanbullah in the cabinet make things
                            easier. As an example of the recent changes, when one soldier <gloss

                                <gloss target="#t_JFK_1">JFK</gloss> Hospital, he beat up the
                            doctors who refused him immediate entrance. That soldier was removed
                            from the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> and locked up. That is
                            some progress. (C)</p>

                            Southern Africa is also a serious problem. We are very interested in

                            Some people say that the principle of non-intervention should be
                            maintained, but what does this mean? In some cases, non-intervention is
                            a factor which I question. We welcome your policies. As you know nature

                            With regard to the north-south dialogue, we in the third world have
                            serious problems. We hope that you will show a particular interest in
                            this issue. We have problems with our balance of payments. This is one
                            of the main subjects of discussion with the World Bank and the <gloss
                                target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss>. Whatever the U.S. can do will be
                            highly beneficial. Current economic problems could lead <pb n="212"
                                facs="0244" xml:id="pg_212"/>to the disintegration of some
                            countries. They might reach the point of no return. How can we be
                            expected to balance our books on Wednesday, when because of price
                            changes, like the recent $2 <gloss target="#t_OPEC_1">OPEC</gloss> oil
                            increase, everything changes on Thursday. The <gloss target="#t_IMF_1"
                                >IMF</gloss> told us two years ago that we had to devalue. But it is
                            very difficult to tell your countrymen that their money is only worth
                            half what it used to be worth. They can’t understand and think you are
                            cheating them. A woman once approached me asking for some money. When I
                            told her I had none she would not believe me and insisted that I must
                            have some because after all my picture was on the money. It is very hard
                            to explain devaluation. We are a small country. Modest help can take us
                            a long way. There is much outside states can do to help. The oil
                            producing states say they will help, but they have done nothing. I hope
                            you will look into this matter before it is too late. (C)</p>

                            privately, how delighted I am that you can be with us and that you
                            brought such a distinguished delegation with you. We have read of their
                            distinguished backgrounds. Their presence will add to the depth of
                            understanding on the issues which we discuss. I am also grateful that
                            you were such a generous host to Vice President <persName

                            many products, and especially the exchange of students. All this has
                            been very beneficial. (S)</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_PF_1">Press</persName> was very pleased to have

                            of common interest, including those of a bilateral, Africa-wide and

                        <p><hi rend="italic">President Shagari:</hi> I want to offer my sincere
                            thanks for your kind invitation. It is especially thoughtful for you to
                            see me now because of all of your other business, the election and the
                            campaign. It will be <pb n="214" facs="0246" xml:id="pg_214"/>definitely
                            a privilege to share part of your time. I am happy that you have invited
                            me and members of my staff for these talks to discuss matters of mutual
                            interest between our two countries. We appreciated very much the visit
                            of your Vice President and others. We had fruitful discussions with
                            them. As in your case, I have four years to accomplish many tasks. One
                            year of that term has already passed. In the next three we will want
                            results. As I told Vice President <persName corresp="#p_MWF_1"
                                >Mondale</persName>, Nigeria cannot afford a lot of bureaucracy and
                            red tape. We do not want talk but action. We want to produce results. We
                            are happy that you have responded positively to our science interest by
                            sending <persName corresp="#p_PF_1">Frank Press</persName>, and by
                            making arrangements for the various committees to discuss the various
                            issues between our two countries. I want to thank you for what you have
                            done. Our officials are here and in other places today to meet with you
                            and others to finalize many things. We really want to get moving. We
                            know how busy you are. Our officials should work together and get
                            results. (S)</p>
                        <p>I know that we have recently formed a joint agricultural committee. I
                            have with me Professor Edozien who will be our chairman; also my
                            Minister of Agriculture and my special advisor who will meet with some
                            of the eminent agriculturists here in the U.S. Our number one priority
                            is agriculture. Nigeria has a lot of potential. Before we exported a lot
                            of food; now we import it. We have every potential to export again. We
                            know how much the U.S. can contribute. The President himself is a farmer
                            and knows what we are talking about. (S)</p>
                        <p>We recognize that agricultural development is a long-term activity and
                            one cannot expect quick results. During my talks with American
                            businessmen in Nigeria and New York all have talked of the trade
                            imbalance between Nigeria and the U.S. As far as I am concerned the way
                            to reduce this imbalance is for Americans to invest in Nigeria in a big
                            way. This will provide much scope for more imports, especially
                            industrial. For our development programs we need increasingly to import
                            machinery, particularly agricultural machinery. We are presently
                            preparing a four-year development plan which we have been working on
                            since January. We have had to import a lot of machinery in the past and
                            hope that your cooperation in the future will be forthcoming. (S)</p>
                        <p>American businessmen also complain about the lack of markets in Africa.
                            Not many know about our potential. We are 80 million people and with
                                <gloss target="#t_ECOWAS_1">ECOWAS</gloss>, we see a possibility of
                            expanding this market to the rest of West Africa with a total market of
                            150 million people. This is a market which we would like to show your
                            businessmen. (S)</p>
                        <p>Another interest is our desire for technology transfer. We need
                            assistance in this regard. We are really going for improved technology
                            in a big way. We are trying to open technical universities and technical
                                <pb n="215" facs="0247" xml:id="pg_215"/>schools. We believe that
                            this technical experience will be required for running both our old and
                            new industries. (S)</p>
                        <p>On the question of education, we owe a great deal to the U.S. Most people
                            who hold high positions in my government were trained in the U.S. We
                            still need teachers from the U.S. These, Mr. President, are some of the
                            points which have been discussed before with the Vice President and Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_PF_1">Press</persName>. (S)</p>
                        <p>Other questions of importance in Africa are: Chad—we are very worried
                            about the situation there; Western Sahara—Nigeria is a member of the
                                <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> “Wisemen”; Namibia—which I
                            discussed with Secretary-General <persName corresp="#p_WK_1"
                                >Waldheim</persName>; South Africa—which concerns us very much; and
                            the Horn of Africa—Nigeria is chairman of the committee set up by the
                                <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> for reconciliation between
                            Ethiopia and Somalia. We held a meeting in Lagos to try to bring
                            together the two countries. There were, of course, certain difficulties.
                            I would be pleased to discuss these and other issues. (S)</p>
                        <p>Outside Africa, Nigeria is concerned about the Middle East, and the war
                            between Iran and Iraq. We are among those who share your concern about
                            the unfortunate situation in Afghanistan. We are very concerned about
                            the hostages in Iran and have made appeals to the Ayatollah. All these
                            things, Mr. President, are matters that concern us. I will be quite
                            happy to do whatever small part I can to contribute toward world peace.
                            (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                    >Carter</persName>:</hi> Thank you very much. It is important to
                            have heard your explanation of the bilateral issues. I am especially
                            interested in the exchange between colleges because I believe our land
                            grant universities have much to offer. The soils in many parts of the
                            U.S. are similar to those in Nigeria. If you should have any needs for
                            fertilizers, transportation, methods to harvest crops or means to
                            control insects or rodents, I hope you will make a request. We will try
                            to be resourceful and send experts to Nigeria, or bring people here. We
                            also can be helpful with the problem of transportation, particularly
                            with regard to the transportation of seed. (S)</p>
                        <p>We are anxious to help on rice. There are certain segments in the
                            American economy who are upset about the difficulties of exporting rice
                            to Nigeria. I would like to see a change in your sales policy authorized
                            by you. Our farmers would like to see this very much. We also have an
                            eager business community which follows this issue. Following my visit I
                            know that you have modified your laws in part to the benefit of both
                            countries. (S)</p>
                        <p>We are pleased by the number of Nigerian students studying in the U.S.,
                            especially in vocational and technical schools. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_PF_1">Press</persName> would like a list of your needs
                            in this area and we will try to accommodate <pb n="216" facs="0248"
                                xml:id="pg_216"/>you. We have a high trade deficit with Nigeria,
                            primarily because of your oil exports. (S)</p>
                        <p>We will consult closely with you on the question of Namibia. As you know,
                            the US is one of the five members of the contact group. You may know
                            also that the Secretary-General is going to southern Africa to explore
                            next steps on October 20. (S)</p>

                        <p><hi rend="italic">President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                    >Carter</persName>:</hi> My opinion is that South Africa has
                            delayed settling the Namibia question month after month. I must not
                            build up expectations too much because in the past when we thought we
                            were close to a settlement, the South Africans have always created
                            problems. I should admit though also that there have been some problems
                            on the other side as well. (S)</p>
                        <p>I share your view on the war between Iran and Iraq. I hope that you will
                            join with others in seeking a peaceful solution to this problem. Twelve
                            million barrels of oil per day flow through the Persian Gulf. A few
                            countries which are dependent upon supplies from Iran and Iraq are now
                            deprived of this fuel. I would hope that during this interim period you
                            could increase Nigerian production and sell to some of them. The spot
                            market is a very difficult and expensive place to purchase fuel. (S)</p>
                        <p>We will follow up on the science and technology exchange. Your

                        <p>I appreciate your efforts to get the hostages in Iran released. Iran has
                            become very isolated in the world community as a result of the hostage
                            issue. We want to see the hostages released, but we would also like to
                            see Iran at peace with its neighbors. This is not possible as long as
                            Iran is guilty of holding hostages. Your assistance is very beneficial.

                        <p>As you know, we follow closely what the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1"
                                >OAU</gloss> does on Chad and the Western Sahara. Please, if you
                            have further ideas on this subject, let me know either through
                            Ambassador Low in Lagos or Ambassador Jolaoso here. We believe that the
                            problems of Africa can best be solved by Africans. We are strongly
                            opposed to the presence of foreign troops in Africa. We would like to
                            see the Cuban troops leave Angola after the problem of Namibia is
                            resolved. The Angolans know our views on this and our desire for normal
                            relations. We appreciate personal consultations. I would be happy if you
                            would send me letters with your thoughts on these issues and I would
                            like also the privilege to write to you from time to time. (S)</p>

                            Egypt does it, perhaps claiming that this is necessary to control the

                            how difficult he can be. We will do our best to talk to them. They
                            support one side one day and another the next. In the case of the
                            Western Sahara, we have managed to get all sides together to talk. We
                            were able to get the Moroccans to attend the most recent session. I
                            believe that this Moroccan willingness was due largely to the pressure
                            which Nigeria applied. The Moroccans have just recently refused to
                            accept our solution from that conference that is a referendum, one which
                            seemed very reasonable to us. The <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>
                            has accepted our solution and the Polisario has accepted it as well.
                            With great difficulty we got the Polisario to agree on a cease-fire and
                            a referendum. (S)</p>
                        <p>The Moroccans have refused the referendum part and parcel. They state
                            that the traditional way of conducting a referendum has already been
                            exercised; that is, the tribal chiefs have already paid homage to the
                            King which they interpret to mean the people have accepted the Moroccan
                            solution. We tried to show that this sort of traditional
                            self-determination is no longer acceptable. There should be a free and
                            fair referendum. Our fear is that they will refuse and that more and
                            more African states will recognize the Polisario. In that case the
                            Polisario will definitely be encouraged to continue fighting. If Morocco
                            goes on fighting that will be too bad for them. They must agree to a
                            referendum supervised by the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> and
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>. Everybody will accept that
                            outcome. We as friends and the US also must exert pressure upon the
                            Moroccans to make them see reason and stop war. (S)</p>
                        <p>Much the same is true in the Horn of Africa. There the <gloss
                                target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> passed a resolution which said that
                            the Ogaden is a part of Ethiopia. This is based on the <gloss
                                target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> charter which says that all colonial
                            boundaries must <pb n="218" facs="0250" xml:id="pg_218"/>be accepted.
                            Unless this principle is accepted all Africa will be at war with each
                            other. The colonial boundaries must be observed. Somalia must realize
                            this. This problem has brought in powers outside Africa. That is one of
                            our problems—foreign troops—they come in when African countries fail to
                            solve problems. Issues should be resolved between neighboring countries
                            themselves. We think the Somalis should accept the resolutions of the
                                <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> instead of fighting. We know
                            these questions are not of your direct concern. We members of the <gloss

                        <p>Meeting with the Joint Agricultural Consultative Committee, Shagari and
                            his senior advisors were very forthcoming on their interest in U.S.
                            agribusiness investment and outlined several changes in their
                            regulations, which have either already been implemented or are in the
                            works, to encourage foreign investment in the agricultural sector. At a
                            follow-up meeting, the members of the Committee seemed to agree that the
                            opportunities were great, but so were the problems. Success depends on
                            Shagari’s continued strong commitment. (LOU)</p>

                        <p rend="center">KEY JUDGMENTS</p>
                        <p>The United States enjoys valuable access rights and facilities in Liberia
                            which probably cannot be duplicated elsewhere on the continent. In the
                            eyes of the world, Liberia is inextricably linked to the United States,
                            and its failures will be interpreted as American failures. As a result,
                            the symbolic importance of Liberia to US interest may even transcend
                            material considerations. If Liberia is disappointed with US assistance,
                            it will turn elsewhere. This could allow nations unfriendly toward the
                            United States to make significant inroads.</p>
                        <p><pb n="221" facs="0253" xml:id="pg_221"/>The coup last April left Liberia
                            with a fragile political system and profound weaknesses in its
                            institutions, leadership, and social structure.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d71fn2">See <ref target="#d55">Documents 55</ref> and <ref
                                    target="#d56">56</ref>.</note> Realization of these conditions,
                            and fear that the most likely alternative to the Doe regime is
                            unpredictable chaos, is probably the major cement holding the system
                            together today. The regime depends on the support of the military, and
                            therefore must satisfy the personal and professional demands of the
                            ethnically disparate rank and file. Continued relative stability in
                            Liberia depends on solving the near-term fiscal crisis to permit
                            continued importation of petroleum products and foodstuffs. In the
                            longer term, basic economic stability will depend on a return of foreign
                            investor confidence. Foreign assistance will be crucial both in the
                            short and in the long run.</p>
                        <p>Despite the grudging acceptance of the new regime by other African
                            governments, Liberian leaders remain frightened of subversion supported
                            from the outside. Efforts by Communist and radical African regimes to
                            exploit the situation have so far generally been unsuccessful because of
                            the Liberian Government’s continued attachment to America and its
                            suspicion of Communist motivation.</p>
                        <p>Civilian rule will not return to Liberia until the economic situation
                            improves to a point where civilians and military alike can count on some
                            benefits from the system. This in turn depends upon the ability of a
                            fragile administration to sustain progress and to resolve day-to-day
                            crises in the fiscal and public security areas. Liberia is bound to the
                            United States and its progress, or lack of it, will depend upon
                            cooperation with the United States or replacement of the United States
                            with some other outside benefactor.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> was in good form and
                            seemed relaxed.</p>
                        <p>3. In seating us at the breakfast table on deck, <persName

                            away from the hot sun in order to “protect human rights”. He then
                            started off the conversation by asking <persName corresp="#p_STW_1"
                                >Seelye</persName> what good news he had brought from

                            for being received by the President, particularly at time when President
                            was busy with consultations with members of his Political Bureau. He
                            reviewed his trip in Africa thus far, observing that <gloss

                                >Seelye</persName> said his next stop would be Cameroon, a country
                            with which the US enjoys excellent relations.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_STW_1">Seelye</persName> said he considered his
                            visit to Zaire the high point of his trip and remarked that it would be

                            relations with Zaire. In this connection, if the President were
                            interested, he would propose to discuss various aspects of our
                            relationship. The President nodded support. <persName corresp="#p_STW_1"

                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_STW_1">Seelye</persName> said that the new

                            to Zaire and noted that we had just submitted to Congress proposals for

                            thereby effect the country’s economic recovery. In doing so, Zaire will
                            need all the help it can get and must therefore look to the US for

                            credits for fiscal year 1978, an undertaking which had been submitted
                            for congressional approval.<note n="4" xml:id="d72fn4">In telegram 41170

                            <persName corresp="#p_STW_1">Seelye</persName> remarked that Congress’
                            increasing role in foreign policy requires much closer consultation

                            matters, and it will therefore be necessary to work more closely than
                            ever with Congress in underlining the importance of our continuing our
                            military assistance program to Zaire. He said that, as part of this
                            effort, I had been asked to return to Washington in a couple of days for
                            consultations. <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> stressed
                            the continuing need for military aid, referring to the hundreds of tanks
                            in neighboring Angola and in Congo as well. <persName corresp="#p_STW_1"
                                >Seelye</persName> noted that, as the President was aware, we had

                            Zaire and that subsequently, last January, US defense experts had held

                            bilateral relationship, but we value the moderate and constructive role
                            that he has played and can continue to play in Africa.</p>
                        <p>11. <persName corresp="#p_STW_1">Seelye</persName> said there were two
                            other matters involving our bilateral relations that he wanted to
                            mention. First, he said that the new administration attaches a great
                            deal of importance to human rights considerations in its relations with
                            countries around the world. Accordingly, programs of bilateral
                            assistance would depend to a certain extent on how recipient governments
                            protect human rights. I interjected to say that Congress also is deeply
                            interested in this issue and has asked the administration to submit to
                            it public reports on the status of human rights in many individual
                            countries, including Zaire, where we of course have important assistance
                            programs. <persName corresp="#p_STW_1">Seelye</persName> went on to say
                            that President <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> should be
                            fully aware of this factor in our foreign policy, although he did not
                            think that this should pose a problem in our relations with Zaire.</p>
                        <p><pb n="225" facs="0257" xml:id="pg_225"/>12. Addressing the issue of
                            human rights, <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> expressed
                            confidence in Zaire’s situation. He said the Zairian people were
                            attached to their leader because they knew he was doing his best to lead
                            and develop the country and to improve their lot. So long as there was
                            this attachment by the people there should be no problem regarding human
                            rights.</p>
                        <p>13. As his final point in discussing our bilateral relationship,
                                <persName corresp="#p_STW_1">Seelye</persName> alluded to the news
                            which had come out during his stay in Kinshasa regarding the Zairian
                            Government’s decision to discontinue its contract with PanAm to manage
                            and operate Air Zaire. He said he was “surprised” at this decision since
                            it seemed to be in our mutual interest to expand all possible areas of
                            American-Zairian relations.</p>
                        <p>14. <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> responded with lengthy
                            explanation of why he found it impossible to renew the PanAm contract,
                            making essentially same points he had previously made to me: i.e., after
                            six years PanAm’s efforts had accomplished next to nothing; contract was
                            tilted in favor of PanAm’s interests vis-a-vis those of Air Zaire;
                            contract was too expensive in light of Zaire’s budgetary and
                            [garble—fiscal?] crunch, with too much evidence of high-living by
                            expatriate employees; those foreigners still needed should be hired
                            individually by Air Zaire, but not under contract with another airline.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> said he had nothing
                            against the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>; but he had concluded
                            it was in Zaire’s sovereign interest to terminate the contract with
                            PanAm. <persName corresp="#p_STW_1">Seelye</persName> acknowledged that
                            it was of course a decision for Zaire to make. I said I understood PanAm
                            would start immediately to remove its personnel and in doing so would
                            make every effort to minimize any possible damage or disruption to Air
                            Zaire’s operations. <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>
                            indicated he appreciated PanAm’s intention to terminate its services
                            “correctly”.</p>
                        <p>15. Turning to area issues, <persName corresp="#p_STW_1"
                                >Seelye</persName> brought the President up to date concerning our
                            approach to resolution of the Southern African problems. Inter alia, he
                            made the following points:</p>
                        <p>(A) The new administration has publicly indicated its determination that
                            the US continue to play an active role in facilitating negotiated

                        <p>(B) The British “formula” for assuming an active role in the transition
                            government still seems to provide a basis for bringing the parties

                        <p>16. With regard to Namibia, <persName corresp="#p_STW_1"
                                >Seelye</persName> said that there has been no movement in the last
                            few months but the US continues to believe South Africa is prepared to
                            make some basic concessions which, if met by some flexibility on the
                            part of <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss>, could produce results.
                                <persName corresp="#p_STW_1">Seelye</persName> stressed that the
                            fact we are working with South Africa in resolving problems of Rhodesia
                            and Namibia should in no way be misinterpreted as US support for
                            apartheid. On the contrary, our policy continues to be based on strong
                            opposition to apartheid and the new administration has already expressed
                            strong views in this regard. At the same time, US policy is based on the
                            premise that top priority should be given to resolving the pressing
                            issues of Rhodesia and Namibia.</p>
                        <p>17. <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> interjected that he
                            fully agreed with this set of priorities and noted basic differences
                            between problems of Rhodesia and South Africa. The whites in Rhodesia
                            were clearly a colonialist minority and there is no question that the
                            country should move quickly to rule by the black majority. In South
                            Africa, on the other hand, the whites had just as much of a claim to
                            staying there as the blacks. The institution of apartheid was the
                            problem, and efforts should therefore be directed toward changing it. On
                            Rhodesia, <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> noted that
                            Zaire opposed exclusion of any of major Zimbabwe nationalist groups and

                        <p>18. On Angola, <persName corresp="#p_STW_1">Seelye</persName> recalled
                            that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VC_1">Vance</persName> announced
                            some weeks ago that the US is prepared to consider normalizing relations
                            with that country, but, frankly, we do not expect this to be an easy
                            process. We are approaching this matter with great care. In response to
                                <persName corresp="#p_STW_1">Seelye</persName>’s query as to
                                <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>’s views on the
                            internal situation in Angola, <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> said it is evident the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1"
                                >MPLA</gloss> regime is split essentially between those favoring the
                            Soviets and Cubans and those opposing them. In any case, the Angolans
                            themselves are not in control of their own affairs. He thought Lara is
                            the man to watch as being potentially one of the most influential
                            members of the regime.</p>
                        <p><pb n="227" facs="0259" xml:id="pg_227"/>19. I raised the question of
                            Zaire’s relations with Angola, noting that Luanda seems finally to have
                            acknowledged Zaire’s formal recognition of the <gloss target="#t_PRA_1"
                                >PRA</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>
                            attributed this acknowledgement to his own rebuttal of Luanda’s charges
                            that forces from Zaire had attacked across the border, noting also that
                            in his rebuttal he had called <persName corresp="#p_NAA_1"
                                >Neto</persName>’s bluff by endorsing <persName corresp="#p_NAA_1"
                                >Neto</persName>’s appeal for an <gloss target="#t_OAU_1"
                                >OAU</gloss> investigation. <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> expressed doubt, however, that Angola’s
                            acknowledgement of Zaire’s recognition meant that Angola would soon be
                            willing to move seriously toward improving relations.</p>
                        <p>20. <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> said that during his
                            recent visit to Nigeria President <persName corresp="#p_OO_1"
                                >Obasanjo</persName> had offered to help in normalizing
                            Zairian-Angolan relations by talking to <persName corresp="#p_NAA_1"
                                >Neto</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> had
                            agreed and the Nigerians did in fact elicit assurances that the <gloss
                                target="#t_PRA_1">PRA</gloss> wished to improve relations. However,
                                <persName corresp="#p_OO_1">Obasanjo</persName> had not been aware
                            of all the charges <persName corresp="#p_NAA_1">Neto</persName> was at
                            the same time making publicly against Zaire, and Nigeria’s efforts had
                            not accomplished much. <persName corresp="#p_STW_1">Seelye</persName>
                            said he was interested in the President’s allusion to better relations
                            between Zaire and Nigeria and wondered if it would be correct to say
                            that these relations are now good. <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> replied in the affirmative.</p>
                        <p>21. <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> closed the
                            conversation by asking <persName corresp="#p_STW_1">Seelye</persName> to
                            convey another message to President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                >Carter</persName>: while Zaire may not be the predominant leader in
                            Africa, it has the capability of exerting strong influence and—just as
                            he helped the previous administration to avoid or resolve certain
                            problems in its relations with Africa—so <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> remains ready to continue to advise and support
                            the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> as it pursues its African
                            policies. <persName corresp="#p_STW_1">Seelye</persName> thanked the
                            President and said he would convey this assurance of continued
                            cooperation to the new administration.</p>
                        <p>2. Comment: <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> was obviously
                            pleased to have this chance to talk to <persName corresp="#p_STW_1"
                                >Seelye</persName>, the second high-ranking official to come out
                            from Washington since the new administration took office. Without
                            resorting to the hard sell, <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> nevertheless made his message clear: he needs and
                            wants our continued economic and military assistance, and is at the same
                            time ready to continue cooperating with us on a spectrum of issues where
                            US interests are involved. Certainly such is the case in Southern
                            Africa, where—although his capacity to influence events is clearly
                                limited—<persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>’s views and
                            objectives remain generally in line with ours and where he is willing to
                            work at least privately with other Africans in support of moderate
                            solutions.</p>

                            The invaders hold a number of towns in the Shaba (Katangan) region along
                            the Angolan border in a triangle approximately 100 miles long and 40
                            miles deep. They also apparently hold 7 American missionaries. At this
                            point we tend to the view that this is a limited incursion in
                            retaliation for alleged Zairian support of Angolan insurgents. It is
                            possible, however, that Angola President <persName corresp="#p_NAA_1"
                                >Neto</persName> wants to promote secession in the Shaba which could

                                >Mobutu</persName>’s overthrow. Zaire’s military forces are of poor
                            quality and most of them are located far from the threatened area. In
                            addition, a severe fuel shortage, particularly in the Shaba, has put a

                            and is playing by ear to see if even this small push might cause
                                <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>’s downfall.</p>
                        <p>I cannot see that it is in our interest to prop <persName

                            own insurgency problems. They know that we (not to mention the South
                            Africans) could turn that pressure up considerably.</p>
                        <p>Even if there turns out to be a modest Cuban involvement, we are dealing
                            here with an African problem that should be handled through African
                            channels—the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> if possible. Our
                            principal interest is to see that the Soviets—and we—play as minor a
                            role as possible. Most Africans share this perspective.</p>
                        <p><pb n="230" facs="0262" xml:id="pg_230"/>We have a long-term interest in
                            the stability of Zaire and perhaps a short-term interest in supporting
                                <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>. Our credibility is
                            not at stake, however. We bear no responsibility for whatever trouble
                                <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> has gotten himself
                            into. Short of major Cuban/Soviet involvement, there is no issue of
                            principle involved for us.</p>
                        <p>Our policy approach should therefore be along these lines:</p>
                        <p>—Actions and statements should be very low key, playing down the idea of
                            Soviet/Cuban involvement unless it becomes clear that they are deeply
                            involved <hi rend="italic">and</hi> present a serious threat.<note n="2"

                                “agree” in the right margin next to this point.</note></p>
                        <p>—In talking to the Soviets and Cubans we should not throw down any

                                remaining three points.</note></p>
                        <p>—We should encourage African mediation, recognizing that such an effort
                            may not come out wholly to the liking of <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName>. That is his problem, not ours.</p>
                        <p>—We should get these points across to <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> and support at the present level of threat should
                            be limited to modest resupply.</p>
                        <p>The actions we have taken thus far seem to be moving in the right
                            direction. They should be strengthened, however, with a more explicit
                            rationale, and monitored closely to ensure that they do not gain an
                            independent momentum.</p>

                                Zaire’s finalized request for military assistance. (National

                                telegram 2320 from Kinshasa, March 15, the Embassy provided
                                justification for <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>’s

                                File, D770089–0387)</note> It is estimated that some of the Zairian

                            in the next few days.</p>
                        <p>We wish to give President Mobuto a chance to mount a credible defense as
                            the pursuit of a diplomatic solution centered around the <gloss
                                target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> goes forward. We must decide how far
                            we wish to go to assist him militarily at this time.</p>
                        <p>A refusal by the U.S. to provide ammunition would obviously hurt
                                <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>’s hope for survival
                            and encourage the invaders to step up the pressure. We could mitigate
                            these adverse effects by providing Zaire with the means to purchase the
                            ammunition. Assuming that we would supply the ammunition directly,
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CWL_1">Cutler</persName> has
                            recommended that we respond only at this time to the request for 2
                            million rounds of M–16 ammunition.</p>
                        <p>Zaire has asked us for ammunition for M–16 rifles, 4.2 inch mortars, 50
                            caliber machine guns and LAWs with a total estimated value of $1.5
                            million. Zaire also has U.S. 75 mm recoilless rifles and 60 mm and 81 mm
                            mortars. Ammunition for all these weapons is produced and can be
                            purchased in Europe. There are no legal impediments to prevent us from
                            authorizing Zaire to draw down on the $28 million in approved FY 1977
                                <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> funds for military <gloss
                                target="#t_POL_1">POL</gloss> imports. In an average month, Zaire
                            spends about $12 million on <gloss target="#t_POL_1">POL</gloss>
                            imports.</p>
                        <p>To arrange this: the oil company from which Zaire purchases its <gloss

                            bill to the Government of Zaire, which then sends the bill to the
                            Defense Department with the <pb n="232" facs="0264" xml:id="pg_232"
                            />normal certificate testifying to the fact that the goods were received
                            and that the Zairian Government wishes to use its credit for this
                            purpose.</p>
                        <p>If you approve, we would approach the Belgian Government to be sure it
                            has no objection to the purchase of the ammunition, and will facilitate
                            the delivery. There are other countries where the ammunition could also
                            be purchased.</p>
                        <p>This indirect route of providing <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> with ammunition would obviously be more
                            acceptable to Congress than supplying it directly from the U.S. There is
                            no legal impediment to allowing <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> to use <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> funds
                            from FY 76 Transitional Quarter and from FY 1977 for the purchase of
                            ammunition in the U.S.</p>
                        <p>I advise that at this time we arrange to provide <persName

                        <p>I raised the question of the invasion into Zaire from Angola with
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF_1">Dobrynin</persName> this afternoon. He
                            told me that the Soviets had been in touch with <persName
                                corresp="#p_NAA_1">Neto</persName> who claimed that there were no
                            Cubans or Angolan forces in Zaire. <persName corresp="#p_NAA_1"
                                >Neto</persName> further said to the Soviets that he would not put
                            Angolan or Cuban troops in Zaire. I told <persName corresp="#p_DAF_1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> that we were very concerned with this incursion
                            and that I expected that they would continue to caution restraint. I
                            informed <persName corresp="#p_DAF_1">Dobrynin</persName> that we had
                            already sent limited supplies and gave him the nature of the

                        <p>Summary: During March 25 meeting I briefed <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> on the status of our consultations with Nigerians
                            on mediation, our undertaking direct contacts with Cubans, and discussed
                            both the political and military dimensions of the Shaba problem. I
                            stressed the importance of Zaire’s continued cooperation in seeking a
                            political solution and need to avoid actions which might impede
                            achievement of that goal. <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>
                            indicated his agreement on most points and understanding of reasons why
                            we placed priority on political settlement. He reiterated his concern,
                            however, re our reluctance to extend more military aid and the dangerous
                            signal this could give to those attacking Zaire. End summary.</p>
                        <p>1. I spent an hour with <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>
                            this morning, March 25. I began by referring to our phone conversation
                            yesterday (Ref A) and said I thought it would be useful to discuss
                            further the reasons why we remained intent on pursuing a diplomatic
                            solution to the Shaba problem as a first priority. I noted that both
                            President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> and Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_VC_1">Vance</persName> had underlined the
                            importance we attach to mediation efforts in recent public
                            statements.</p>
                        <p><pb n="235" facs="0267" xml:id="pg_235"/>2. <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> broke in, as I expected he would, to say that not
                            all of those statements were very favorable for Zaire. He mentioned
                            particularly the President’s press conference remark yesterday to the
                            effect that the US had no military obligation to Zaire,<note n="7"

                                    >Carter</persName> said, “We look on them as a friendly nation,
                                and we have no obligations to them as far as military aid goes. But
                                we have been cooperating in exchanging information with the Belgian
                                Government, the French Government, and others, just to try to
                                stabilize the situation and to lessen the chance of expanding the

                            might only encourage the Angolans and their Cuban and Soviet supporters
                            to pursue their aggression against Zaire. I said that, while I had no
                            official elaboration, from reading the text of the President’s comments
                            I had the impression he was speaking more in the context of whether we
                            were actually committed to make further arms shipments in response to
                            the Shaba attack, and not so much in terms of our ongoing, longer-range
                                <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> program. As <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> was well aware, the question of
                            the degree of our response had aroused considerable interest both in the
                            US media and the Congress, and the administration had made clear that it
                            intends to weigh all factors carefully. <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> then expressed surprise that Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_VC_1">Vance</persName> had told the press that, in view
                            of mediation efforts, no additional shipments will be made to Zaire. I
                            corrected this, noting that the Secretary had said such shipments may
                                <gloss target="#t_rpt_1">rpt</gloss> may be unnecessary.<note n="8"

                                responded to questions from reporters. In response to a question
                                about the U.S. response to Zaire’s request for ammunition, he said,
                                “We have nothing at this point. At the moment, we’re looking to see
                                what we can do on the question of a political solution there.” The
                                reporter followed up by asking, “It may be unnecessary, is that what
                                you seem to be saying?” <persName corresp="#p_VC_1">Vance</persName>
                                responded, “It may be unnecessary.” (National Archives, RG 59,

                        <p>3. I then returned to the question of mediation and gave <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> a run-down of the Secretary’s
                            consultations with Nigerian <gloss target="#t_FonMin_1">FonMin</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GJN_1">Garba</persName> (Refs B, C) which, I
                            noted, seemed to have gone very well. <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> listened with interest and seemed pleased with
                            the results. When I mentioned <persName corresp="#p_GJN_1"
                                >Garba</persName>’s concern that any attempt to pursue the Katangans
                            across the border into Angola might provoke an escalation of the
                            conflict, <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> said <persName
                                corresp="#p_GJN_1">Garba</persName> had expressed the same concern
                            to <persName corresp="#p_NK_1">Nguza</persName> and he, <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>, understood well why this would
                            indeed cause problems. I also noted that Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_VC_1">Vance</persName> had confirmed we were talking to
                            the Soviets about the Shaba problem. I then went on to convey the
                            Secretary’s message concerning US-Cuban discussions (Ref D), noting our
                            hope to broaden the talks to cover Cuba’s intervention in Angola and its
                            policies in Africa.</p>
                        <p><pb n="236" facs="0268" xml:id="pg_236"/>4. I said all of these
                            activities—including instructions just sent to our posts in a number of
                            African countries which <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>
                            had suggested to us—clearly showed our continuing desire to be helpful
                            in Africa.<note n="9" xml:id="d77fn9">Telegram 64155 to all African

                                Zaire. (National Archives, RG 59, Central Foreign Policy File,
                                D770158–0374)</note> As for the Shaba, our stress on an African
                            solution does not mean we intend to wash our hands of the whole affair.
                            On the contrary, we are playing an active although discreet role with
                            many parties in support of successful mediation. I expressed the
                            personal view that a political solution was by far the best and perhaps
                            the only feasible way to resolve the Shaba problem.</p>
                        <p>5. I said I had been impressed by the positive steps <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> himself had taken in the
                            diplomatic area, and expressed hope we could count on his continued
                            close cooperation. I thought it was particularly important to avoid any
                            actions that might harm the chances for mediation or provide Luanda with
                            excuses—such as claims of Zairian border provocations—for abandoning the
                            political track. On the other hand, I could see an advantage in finding
                            ways to demonstrate positive support for mediation, which would
                            strengthen Zaire’s international position and certainly be well received
                            in the US. In this regard, I favorably noted a report this morning that
                            the GOZ had stated it had no objection to Nigerian mediation.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> agreed on the need to
                            avoid charges of not wanting a political settlement and, in this regard,
                            said he had no intention of stirring up trouble elsewhere along the
                            border. He then went on to review some of the GOZ’s successful efforts
                            to gain diplomatic support, noting <persName corresp="#p_AID_1"
                                >Amin</persName>’s decision to send food to Zaire (which he found
                            amusing) and the support for Zaire published by the Libyan press (which
                            he found mystifying). He said the GOZ would continue its diplomatic
                            efforts and would seek additional ways to indicate a positive approach
                            to mediation. Then, he said, if Angola backs away the onus for failure
                            will be on them.</p>
                        <p>7. Turning to military matters, I said I did not yet have a definitive
                            reaction to <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>’s suggestion
                            that we might find a way to help finance Belgian arms and ammunition
                            shipments to Zaire. However, I did not discount the possibility that
                            something along these lines might be feasible. As for mercenaries, I
                            referred to General Babia’s comments to our ZAMISH chief on this matter
                            (Ref E). I said that, while I had no official guidance, my personal view
                            was that news of introduction of foreign mercenaries in Shaba,
                            particularly Americans, [would] elicit a decidedly negative reaction in
                            the US. The whole mercenary question had proved highly controversial in
                            the US during the Angolan war, <pb n="237" facs="0269" xml:id="pg_237"
                            />and I anticipated a similar reaction should they now turn up in Shaba.
                            As for Babia’s suggestion that we might help in recruiting
                                anti-<persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Castro</persName> Cuban
                            mercenaries, I thought this was clearly out of the question. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> said he understood and agreed
                            with my assessment, and said the GOZ did not have in mind seeking <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> assistance in recruitment. He did not
                            explicitly confirm or deny that he intended to move ahead with putting
                            mercenaries in place. However, he went on to stress the urgent need to
                            improve the lamentable performance of his forces in Shaba. In this
                            connection, he said he would make major changes in command personnel in
                            the next few days. <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> gave
                            no detailed response to my query as to how he intended to proceed
                            militarily in Shaba, other than to confirm that defense of Kolwezi had
                            first priority and that he also intended to counter-attack at an early
                            date.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> made a final reference
                            to the serious threat which the Shaba invasion posed to Zaire’s
                            hard-pressed economy, both in terms of domestic finances and the
                            negative impact it might have on foreign donors and investors. He hoped
                            he could count on our continuing assistance. I said we were proceeding
                            with our economic assistance programs and were alert to new needs which
                            might arise. This very serious aspect of the current situation
                            underlined the importance of resolving the Shaba problem just as quickly
                            as possible.</p>
                        <p>9. Comment: <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> was in one of
                            his rare listening moods today and seemed to take in most of what I
                            said. While I suspect he harbors reservations about the Nigerian role
                            and tends to view of the whole mediation track more in terms of
                            political competition than a serious way out of his problems, he still
                            seems inclined to cooperate. In this regard, I believe the fact that we
                            ourselves are playing an active role is a source of reassurance and
                            encouragement to him. Certainly by now he understands the problems we
                            have in moving ahead with further military aid at this time and the real
                            importance we place on a political solution.</p>

                            our help in funding the importation of petroleum products to meet

                            average month, Zaire spends roughly $12 million on <gloss

                        <p>1. Following is summary of Secretary’s April 2 conversation in Paris with
                            Giscard on Zaire.</p>
                        <p>2. Secretary summarized U.S. actions concerning situation thus far, noted
                            speed with which we had responded to <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName>’s request for non-lethal aid,<note n="2"

                                Bonn, March 31, the Department reported on congressional
                                consultations on assistance to Zaire that “the reaction is mixed and
                                some of it quite negative.” (National Archives, RG 59, Central

                            with inaccuracy of intelligence received from Zaire and bluntly
                            condemned military competence of <gloss target="#t_FAZ_1">FAZ</gloss>.
                            He noted this reluctance to fight created great problems for <gloss

                            pointing to regional and broader effects in Africa of Shaba

                            Belgian and French assistance, and expressed view Zaire could not hold
                            out without support. Secretary reported he had twice warned Soviets of
                            adverse consequences of Zaire developments. When he raised issue in
                            Moscow, Soviet response was totally inadequate, consisting of repeating
                            Angolan assurances of non-involvement and stating Katangans were not
                            using Soviet equipment.<note n="4" xml:id="d79fn4">See <ref

                        <p>4. Giscard commented at length on Zaire in context of overall African
                            situation, seeing Zaire as test for both U.S. and France. He claimed
                            U.S. had been rather indifferent to Africa in past 12 years, which saw
                            nearly half of African regimes move toward pro-Soviet affiliation. Rest
                            could follow by 1980 unless we meet challenge. Moderate leaders know
                            that Soviets would provide ample arms, lots of aid and, if necessary,
                            Cuban military assistance, thus assuring their personal safety. West on
                            other hand provides little or no military aid, <pb n="240" facs="0272"
                                xml:id="pg_240"/>some economic aid, but no technicians or advisers.
                            Africans have never shown martial prowess.</p>
                        <p>5. Giscard said <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> is Zaire’s
                            only possible leader; without him country will rapidly fall into
                            anarchy. He should not be dropped unless it becomes absolutely certain
                            he cannot survive. Some of the business interests which control Belgian
                            policy are tempted to flirt with Katanga solution. This would be gross
                            mistake. It important to stabilize military situation, if only for few
                            weeks. France is trying to do so “ourselves”. Morocco will probably soon
                            send few “volunteers” and Egypt perhaps some air transport. King Hassan
                            said he will decide soon after one of his ablest advisers now in Zaire
                            returns. Giscard expressed belief even 200 good fighting men could bring
                            overnight change to military situation, which not regular war but rather
                            homeward migration of Katangans. Once they leave forests and try capture

                        <p>6. Secretary agreed we should try to avoid giving any impression we are

                            but warned some Congressmen might so speculate and the press might use
                            such comments to misstate our policy. We would have problem there.
                            Secretary added we would move ahead with support for <persName

                            as soon as he returned to Washington. We will consider requests for more
                            petroleum, rations or other non-lethal supplies. We must by law inform
                            Congress of any sizeable amounts of assistance but within certain limits
                            we can give <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> more. Willing
                            fighters on ground are vital to provide time for political solution.</p>

                        <p>Our intelligence on the invasion is limited and confirmed information is
                            particularly scarce. [<hi rend="italic">1 line not declassified</hi>] We
                            have moved additional personnel and equipment to Lubumbashi
                            (approximately 400 kilometers from the fighting) and hope to obtain air
                            photography within the next week.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Tactical Situation</p>
                        <p>The invaders entered Zaire March 8 and occupied three towns along the
                            western and southern borders of Shaba Region with Angola: Kapanga (in
                            the north), the border and railhead town of Dilolo, and the manganese
                            mining town of Kisenge (in the south).</p>
                        <p>Moving slowly along the Dilolo-Kolwezi, the invaders are now somewhere
                            east of Mutshatsa, probably in the area of Kayembe, approximately 80
                            kilometers west of Kolwezi. There are unconfirmed intelligence reports
                            that the invaders have also moved north from <pb n="242" facs="0274"
                                xml:id="pg_242"/>Kapanga towards the Kasai Region, and south of
                            Kolwezi towards the key junction of Tenke (the rail link to the north).
                            Finally, there are unconfirmed reports that as many as 250 invaders have
                            infiltrated into Kolwezi itself.</p>
                        <p>There have been no significant battles; the only confirmed fire-fight was
                            the ambushing (with upwards of 200 casualties) of a Zairian unit near
                            Kisenge in the first few days.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Invaders</p>
                        <p>In one of their rare announcements, the invaders have identified
                            themselves as ex-Katanga Gendarmes. The Zairian Government claims they
                            number 5,000 and are accompanied by Cubans and/or mercenaries—which we
                            doubt. We estimate their numbers at approximately 2,000. There are
                            unconfirmed reports that up to 4,000 more Katangan Gendarmes are in
                            reserve in Angola.</p>
                        <p>In local terms, the invaders are experienced and disciplined troops.
                            Although the Zairians claim they are equipped with armor, rockets, and
                            heavy artillery, we have no independent confirmation. We assume they
                            have mostly small arms and crew served weapons (probably from former
                            Portuguese and/or perhaps Cuban and Soviet stocks) as well as
                            vehicles.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Angolan, Cuban and Soviet Backing</p>
                        <p>We assume that at a minimum the Soviet and the Cubans (who helped train
                            the Katangans during the past two years) acquiesced in the Zaire
                            invasion. The Angolans are presumably providing at least logistical
                            support from their side of the border. Angolan President <persName

                        <p>Opposition to <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> consists of
                            a number of small, fragmented movements led by various exiled political
                            figures. There is also a minor insurgent opposition in the far east of
                            the country which <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> has not
                            been able to eliminate, but which has not yet tried to exploit the
                            invasion.</p>
                        <p>A number of the opposition figures recently formed a coalition and
                            presented a letter to our Embassy in Paris asking the <gloss

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Political Atmosphere in Zaire</p>
                        <p>More important than organized exile dissidence is the emergence of vocal
                            opposition to <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> within the
                            Zairian establishment. From a position of popularity as the man who
                            restored order, <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> has in
                            the past three years lost most of his credibility with Zairians (both
                            elite and the mass). This results primarily from a series of disastrous
                            political and economic policies rather than from ideological
                            differences. The invasion appears to have brought criticism to a point
                            where highly placed members of the elite no longer support his
                            continuation in office.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Zairian Armed Forces</p>
                        <p>The air force transport wing (<gloss target="#t_C130_1">C–130s</gloss>)
                            appears to be performing well but the attack component equipped with
                            Mirage jets and Macchi fighters has been useless.</p>
                        <p>The Zairian army numbers under 30,000, plus 30,000 Gendarmes (police). It
                            has little heavy equipment. Morale, training and competent leadership
                            are lacking. There are mixed reports as to how well Zairian units
                            performed in the Angolan war, but in the end all of them were
                            demoralized by the beating they took from the Cuban backed Angolans.</p>
                        <p>Their officer corps is, broadly speaking, divided into two groups: the
                            blatantly political elements and a number of trained professionals.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> has constantly
                            balanced off these groups. The units and officers sent to Shaba so far
                            have been drawn from the poorest elements of the army.</p>
                        <p>There were no Zairian forces west of Kolwezi when the attack began, and
                            no more than three battalions in the whole region. They have since
                            transported upwards of five battalions (possibly 3,000 men) to Shaba.
                            Zaire’s best units, the para-commandos, remain in the Kinshasa

                        </list>
                        <p>I have examined the various options available to us in connection with
                            the continuing invasion of Zaire, and their respective implications. Our
                            options range from maximum support to total non-involvement and
                            encouragement of internal reform.</p>
                        <p>We face a situation where the military prognosis is very poor, and tends
                            to undermine our diplomatic and political actions. The Zairian forces
                            have shown little will to fight, and are only now beginning to get
                            organized in the defense of Zaire’s main copper center. There is no
                            certainty that foreign mercenaries or military cadres can stiffen the
                            Zairians sufficiently to develop some military equilibrium, supportive
                            of diplomatic efforts. Or, that the other side may not try to trump
                            foreign combat aid to Zaire by escalating in its turn.</p>
                        <p>The military situation is, also, further weakening political support for
                            President <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>. But <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> is a fighter not inclined to
                            make concessions to his opposition under pressure. And no one can
                            identify an obvious alternative leader capable of preventing a return to
                            the regionalism and factionalism which threatened to disintegrate Zaire
                            after independence. We see little alternative, therefore, to continued
                            support of the legitimate government. Now is not the moment to <pb
                                n="245" facs="0277" xml:id="pg_245"/>address the longer-term
                            question of reform in Zaire, or to try dealing with <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>’s opposition.</p>
                        <p>Our influence in this situation is unfortunately limited, and yet our
                            prestige as well as our interests are involved. Given the unfavorable
                            outlook, we should avoid making Zaire appear a test of American interest
                            or will, indeed a major East-West confrontation. At the same time, our
                            failure to support Zaire against an attack widely perceived in Africa as
                            having been engineered by Angola and its communist supporters would also
                            have wider repercussions on our future influence on that continent.<note

                        <p>We will need, of course, to consult first with key members of Congress,
                            explain the rationale and scope of our policy, and hopefully obtain
                            their concurrence, if not enthusiastic support. Because of Congressional
                            concerns, we should consult regularly with Congress, at least once a
                            month, making very clear to key Congressional leaders exactly what we
                            have sent Zaire, what we propose to do further and why. I recommend a
                            supportive but limited policy involving the following courses of
                            action:</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Military</hi>. We will, in consultation with Congress,
                            make further shipments of non-lethal equipment, including <gloss

                            Quarter and FY 1977 are estimated at $30 million. We would provide the
                            pending Zairian request for non-lethal equipment, valued at $13 million
                            (Tab 1); of that $13 million, over $9 million is for a <gloss

                                wrote “OK” in the left margin.</note> We would plan to expend the
                            balance of the $30 million, if necessary, with great care.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mercenaries</hi>. We will neither encourage nor
                            discourage our allies from providing mercenaries requested by President
                                <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>. However, if pressed,
                            we will have to express our general disapproval of mercenaries, the use
                            of which can be expected to be widely criticized.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Foreign Troops</hi>. Reports of whether—and how
                            many—foreign troops, especially Moroccans and Egyptians, might go to

                            April 8, at the earliest. We will be addressing messages to the
                            Moroccans and Egyptians telling them in general what we propose to do,
                            asking what they plan to provide. While the appearance of foreign
                            African officers in Zaire is more acceptable publicly than mercenaries,
                            this course is also not without its complications—particularly if the
                            other side should escalate its involvement. We may also expect requests
                            for <pb n="246" facs="0278" xml:id="pg_246"/>assistance in funding or
                            facilitating military aid from moderate African states which we will

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Economic</hi>. We can be quickly supportive by
                            authorizing the expenditure of the FY 1977 $16.6 million Security
                            Supporting Assistance commodity import program and the $14.9 million
                                <gloss target="#t_PL_1">PL</gloss>–480 program. Both programs could
                            probably be ready for signature within a week but it would take several
                            months for any commodities to reach Zaire, unless items destined for
                            delivery elsewhere were diverted there. If necessary, we will seek to
                            make such diversions and as expeditiously as possible.<note n="5"

                        <p>We also plan to encourage the International Monetary Fund, World Bank,
                            international banking community (via Citibank) and other governments to
                            be understanding of Zaire’s present financial difficulties.
                            Specifically, we would propose postponement of the Paris Club debt

                            contribute to the success of the Nigerian initiative and the
                            preservation of Zaire’s territorial integrity. If this effort fails, and
                            the conflict continues, we will examine the possibility of getting
                            Nigeria alone or with several other states to ask <gloss

                        <p>—We continue to uphold the principles of territorial integrity and
                            non-interference, both for Africa as a whole and in the specific case of
                            Zaire.</p>
                        <p>—Many African leaders are concerned by the implications of this attack
                            for their own future security and territorial integrity.</p>
                        <p>—Whatever their objectives, the Katangan insurgents risk re-igniting the
                            civil war which devastated the old Congo.</p>
                        <p>—We believe that the current problem in Zaire is one which should be
                            solved by Africans and we fully support diplomatic efforts to this
                            end.</p>
                        <p>—We will continue to keep the Congress fully informed of our actions.</p>

                            <p>The following non-lethal military support items are presently on
                                order for delivery under Foreign Military Sales credits. The cost
                                column should generally be treated as including estimates rather
                                than firm figures. The items have been purchased either directly or
                                commercially with <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> credits in
                                some cases dating back to FY 1975. It is estimated that Zaire has
                                used up about $8 million of its $10 million in Transitional Quarter
                                credits, (including, to avoid default, <gloss target="#t_FMS_1"

                                            military transport system to the Shaba. Thus far, we can
                                            take some pride in the fact that this US-organized
                                            branch of the Zairian forces is operating relatively
                                            efficiently. It would be good to be able to authorize
                                            release of this plane for delivery as soon as possible.

                        <p>1. Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_NK_1">Nguza</persName> called
                            me in at noon today, April 7, to inform me that 1500 Moroccan troops
                            will start arriving in Zaire April 8. Troops will be transported by Air
                            Zaire DC–10 aircraft in series of six flights beginning this evening.
                            Troops will be flown directly from Morocco to Lubumbashi or,
                            alternatively via Libreville which <persName corresp="#p_NK_1"
                                >Nguza</persName> said will be used by Moroccans as their
                            “operational base”. From Lubumbashi they will be transported directly to
                            Kolwezi in <gloss target="#t_FAZ_1">FAZ</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_C130_1">C–130</gloss>’s. Morocco will also send
                            approximately 125 “military vehicles” and six tons of materiel.</p>
                        <p><pb n="250" facs="0282" xml:id="pg_250"/>2. An Egyptian military
                            delegation headed by general officer will arrive Kinshasa tonight to
                            make arrangements for provision of Egyptian troops. <persName

                            following request for US Government support of the Moroccan/Egyptian
                            operation:</p>
                        <p>A. Tents for 3,000 personnel (this is now rainy season in Shaba).</p>
                        <p>B. Organizational tentage for 2 infantry brigade configuration (CP tents,
                            GP mediums, kitchen tents, etc.).</p>
                        <p>C. Medical supplies for 3,000 personnel.</p>
                        <p>D. C-rations for 5,000 men for 30 days.</p>
                        <p>E. Assistance in air transport of 200,000 cans of Coke to be purchased
                            commercially in US by GOZ. (Coke is staple in Zairian diet and
                            presumably is for <gloss target="#t_FAZ_1">FAZ</gloss> as well.)<note

                                >Mobutu</persName>: <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>
                            values assurances, as most recently conveyed in Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_VC_1">Vance</persName>’s letter of March 11, that US
                            will continue its traditional support of Zairian unity.<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d82fn4">In telegram 56010 to Kinshasa, March 12, the
                                Department transmitted the text of <persName corresp="#p_VC_1"
                                    >Vance</persName>’s letter to <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                    >Mobutu</persName>, in which he wrote, “The United States has
                                for 17 years been an unwavering supporter of Zairian unity and we
                                have no intention of changing now.” (National Archives, RG 59,
                                Central Foreign Policy File, D770086–0492)</note> At the same time,
                                <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> understands problems
                            which Shaba invasion has caused the administration and Congress.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> shares our concern
                            that the Shaba problem be handled to the extent possible within African
                            context. It is with that in mind that Zaire readily accepted Nigeria’s
                            offer to seek mediation. By the same token, request for military
                            assistance from fellow African states such as Morocco and Egypt complies
                            with principle of Africans trying to solve their own problems. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> hopes the US will bear these
                            points in mind when deciding whether it can lend the limited logistical
                            support requested above.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_NK_1">Nguza</persName> also provided following
                            background to current operation: Idea of sending troops was first
                            discussed during <persName corresp="#p_NK_1">Nguza</persName>’s visit to
                            Cairo and Marrakesh. Morocco then sent Air Force delegation to Kinshasa
                            last week for consultations. After this delegation reported back to King
                            Hassan, latter consulted with Sadat and Giscard. Giscard indicated his
                                <pb n="251" facs="0283" xml:id="pg_251"/>support, as did Sadat
                            following his consultations with Giscard in Paris last weekend. At that
                            time Sadat also told Hassan that Egypt would favorably consider taking
                            similar action but he first wanted to talk further with Giscard and
                            President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NK_1">Nguza</persName> anticipates that Sadat will make
                            definitive decision next week to send similar force. He said Saudis have
                            agreed to provide discreet financial assistance to both Moroccans and
                            Egyptians.</p>
                        <p>6. General Babia conveyed much of the same information to Chief ZAMISH,
                            including request for US logistical support, at the same time I was
                            seeing <persName corresp="#p_NK_1">Nguza</persName>. In his presentation
                            Babia specified that Moroccan force would be paratroop unit. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NK_1">Nguza</persName> said whole matter was being very
                            tightly held for the time being in the hope that the entire Moroccan
                            force could be in place in Shaba prior to Moroccan/Zairian announcement
                            of action being taken.</p>
                        <p>7. In response to my query, <persName corresp="#p_NK_1">Nguza</persName>
                            said he did not believe Moroccan/Egyptian intervention would interfere
                            with Nigerian mediation effort. He said <persName corresp="#p_OO_1"
                                >Obasanjo</persName> had emphasized necessity of holding the line
                            militarily if negotiations were to succeed. <persName corresp="#p_NK_1"
                                >Nguza</persName> acknowledged, however, that GOZ had not yet
                            informed Nigerians and did not intend to do so until operation well
                            underway.</p>
                        <p>8. GOZ is apparently making separate requests to French and Belgians for
                            military assistance/support, and we will report on this separately. Our
                            initial impression is that GOZ is asking them mainly to support <gloss
                                target="#t_FAZ_1">FAZ</gloss> while making its requests to US in the
                            context of supporting other African troops being sent to help.</p>

                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Congressional Consultations on Zaire:</hi> We have
                            begun to call members of the Leadership and others who should be
                            consulted on your decision to provide assistance to Zaire. We expect to
                            complete the calls late today or early tomorrow. We are emphasizing the
                            following points:</p>
                        <p>—The outlook in Zaire is uncertain at best, and we must avoid making
                            Zaire appear as a test of American interest or will, or a major
                            East-West confrontation. At the same time, our failure to support Zaire
                            against an attack on its territorial integrity would have wider
                            repercussions on our future influence in Africa.<note n="2"

                                initialed “C” in the left margin.</note></p>
                        <p>—We will send non-lethal equipment and only in amounts already approved
                            by Congress for Zaire.</p>
                        <p>—We do not plan to expand the number of American personnel in Zaire.</p>
                        <p>—We will accelerate already programmed economic assistance in the form of
                                <gloss target="#t_PL_1">PL</gloss> 480 food and commodity
                            imports.</p>
                        <p>—Belgium and France are providing logistic support; France is also
                            supplying military advisors. We were not consulted by Morocco on its
                            decision to send troops to Zaire or by France on its decision to lend
                            support. But we are hopeful that their effort can stabilize the military
                            situation so that the Nigerian diplomatic effort will have a chance to
                                work.<note n="3" xml:id="d83fn3">See <ref target="#d82">Document

                        <p>I will report to you tomorrow on the Congressional reaction to our
                            consultation after all the calls are completed.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi rend="italic">US Assistance to Zaire:</hi> You had two questions
                            on the memorandum that I sent to you last week on US assistance to

                        <p>—First, you asked why I said we should turn down requests for US
                            assistance in funds or military aid from moderate African states
                            interested in helping Zaire. The reasons for opposing such aid are
                            essentially political. We have the authority to let a foreign government
                            use US supplied defense articles for purposes other than internal

                            His chief concern was whether this assistance would really make a

                            pleased that we called her but is highly skeptical. However, she

                            read as backing out of our commitment to Zaire. She will appear on a
                            television talk show tonight (in Los Angeles, we believe) and can be
                            expected to raise questions but will be moderate in her criticism.</p>

                            the Congressional mark-ups for Security Supporting Assistance are taking
                            place this week, and we can expect considerable opposition to a
                            continuation of our previous military aid relationship with Zaire. We
                            are attempting to devise a strategy that will allow us some flexibility
                            in making future decisions with respect to both lethal and non-lethal
                                equipment.<note n="5" xml:id="d85fn5"><persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"

                        <p>After an extensive study of Zaire’s military capabilities and needs, it
                            was decided in November of last year to offer Zaire a military “upgrade
                            package” designed to equip and train a Zairian military force over a
                            period of four years which would be capable of deterring external
                            aggression, especially in the Shaba region. The recent events in Shaba
                            have underscored the continuing importance of assisting Zaire in the
                            development of such a force. The upgrade package consisted of 56 <pb
                                n="256" facs="0288" xml:id="pg_256"/>heavy armored cars, mobile
                            artillery and a program to train and equip infantry for integrated
                            mobile operations.<note n="6" xml:id="d85fn6"><persName
                                    corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> underlined “heavy armored
                                cars,” “mobile artillery,” and “train and equip infantry,” and wrote
                                “ok” in the right margin.</note></p>
                        <p>Subsequently, the previous administration decided for political and
                            psychological reasons to add 10 M–60 tanks to the upgrade package.<note
                                n="7" xml:id="d85fn7"><persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>
                                underlined “10 M–60” and wrote “no” in the right margin.</note>
                            Given the absence of a security justification for the tanks and the
                            strong Congressional opposition we would encounter to providing them, we
                            are eliminating them from the package. I nevertheless believe that we
                            should attempt to retain some flexibility to provide Zaire with the
                            other types of equipment in the original package and also to respond to
                            any future requests we receive from the Zairians for emergency supplies.
                            To do this, I intend to have Administration witnesses try to retain as
                            much as possible of the $30 million in security supporting assistance
                            requested in our FY 78 budget proposal for possible use in the
                            development of such a mobile force. If this package were authorized, we
                            could still, of course, continue our present policy of limiting sales to
                            non-lethal items if circumstances in FY 78 so dictate.</p>

                        <p>Summary: The invasion of Zaire was planned and carried out in close
                            coordination with Angolan Army and Cuban military personnel in
                                Angola.<note n="2" xml:id="d86fn2">An unknown hand underlined this
                                sentence.</note> The invaders were promised full Angolan support.
                            They assumed that many African countries would support the invasion,
                            that <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> would be quickly
                            overthrown and that no outside military assistance would be available to
                            Zaire. Zaire Air Force operations greatly demoralized the Katangan
                            troops as did the failure of their <gloss target="#t_SAM_1"
                            >SAM</gloss>–7 anti-aircraft weapons. The arrival of the Moroccans
                            caused panic among the invaders and caused Angola to suspend its
                            promised support. No contingency plans were made for insurgent
                            operations in Zaire and it is estimated that one-half of the invading
                            soldiers have fled and no longer want to fight.</p>
                        <p>1. The invasion of Zaire by ex-Katangan gendarmes from Angola was planned
                            and prepared in close coordination with the Angolan Army (<gloss
                                target="#t_FAPLA_1">FAPLA</gloss>) personnel and Cuban military
                            advisors assigned to <gloss target="#t_FAPLA_1">FAPLA</gloss> in
                                Angola.<note n="3" xml:id="d86fn3">An unknown hand underlined this
                                sentence.</note> The invasion plan was built around three basic
                            assumptions: (A) that the Zaire Army (<gloss target="#t_FAZ_1"
                                >FAZ</gloss>) would not fight and that most of its soldiers would
                            defect to the invaders, (B) that Zaire President <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> Sese Seko was sufficiently
                            unpopular in Africa that he would receive no support from other African
                            states and that many African states would publically support the
                            invasion whose goal was to over<pb n="258" facs="0290" xml:id="pg_258"
                            />throw <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>, and (C) that
                                <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> would not be able to
                            obtain effective outside military assistance to fight the invasion.</p>
                        <p>2. The invasion was carried out by a force of about 1,000 men who were
                            armed primarily with light weapons including rifles, AK–47 automatic
                            weapons, light machine guns, grenade launchers, 61 mm mortars, grenades
                            and mines. The invaders were trained in Angola by <gloss
                                target="#t_FAPLA_1">FAPLA</gloss> and Cuban personnel and the
                            weapons were provided from <gloss target="#t_FAPLA_1">FAPLA</gloss>
                                stocks.<note n="4" xml:id="d86fn4">An unknown hand underlined this
                                and the previous sentence.</note> The invaders were promised that as
                            the invasion progressed and showed signs of succeeding, heavier weapons
                            would be provided, including 81 mm mortars, 75 mm recoilless artillery,
                                <gloss target="#t_SAM_1">SAM</gloss>–7 anti-aircraft weapons, and
                            “Stalin organ” 122-mm rocket launchers. As the invasion expanded, and if
                            heavy fighting developed to capture Kolwezi or Lubumbashi, Angola
                            promised that armored vehicles, tanks and heavy artillery would be sent
                            to support them. Large numbers of such equipment were stockpiled at
                            Henrique da Carvalho by <gloss target="#t_FAPLA_1">FAPLA</gloss> and the
                            Cubans and these were shown to most of the Katangan invaders before the
                            invasion to boost their morale. The tanks and armored vehicles were to
                            be crewed by <gloss target="#t_FAPLA_1">FAPLA</gloss> personnel since
                            none of the Katangans were trained in their use.</p>
                        <p>3. The initial objectives of the invasion were the capture of Mutshasa
                            and Kolwezi. Mutshasa was to be made the prime military base because it
                            is located in terrain which is easily defensible, and Kolwezi was to be
                            made the administrative center. By the time Mutshasa and Kolwezi had
                            fallen it was assumed that <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName>’s position would be shaky, that the population of
                            Shaba and the <gloss target="#t_FAZ_1">FAZ</gloss> would be rallying to
                            the invaders, and that the push onward to Lubumbashi would be relatively
                            easy.</p>
                        <p>4. When the invasion began, the Katangans found that the majority of the
                            population welcomed their arrival and that most <gloss target="#t_FAZ_1"
                                >FAZ</gloss> units were giving up without a fight. The invaders were
                            also helped by several high-level “traitors” (unidentified) in the
                                <gloss target="#t_FAZ_1">FAZ</gloss> command structure who were
                            secretly providing information on <gloss target="#t_FAZ_1">FAZ</gloss>
                            plans and order of battle. The move to Mutshasa was done with relative
                            ease and against no significant <gloss target="#t_FAZ_1">FAZ</gloss>
                            opposition. However, many of the Katangans had become nervous by the
                            time of their arrival at Mutshasha because some <gloss target="#t_FAZ_1"
                                >FAZ</gloss> units were resisting their advance, and because there
                            was no widespread defection by <gloss target="#t_FAZ_1">FAZ</gloss>
                            troops from other parts of Shaba.</p>
                        <p>5. During the first two weeks of the invasion a number of <gloss
                                target="#t_FAPLA_1">FAPLA</gloss> and Cuban advisors visited Dilolo
                            and areas east of Dilolo but they took no part in the fighting. The
                            Cubans were mostly light-skinned Cubans dressed in unmarked
                                uniforms.<note n="5" xml:id="d86fn5">An unknown hand underlined this
                                and the previous sentence.</note> There were rumors among the <pb

                            Mutshasa that some Cubans and <gloss target="#t_FAPLA_1">FAPLA</gloss>

                            Kapanga, but these rumors could not be confirmed.<note n="6"
                                xml:id="d86fn6">At a news conference on April 22, President
                                    <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> was asked if
                                Cubans were present in Zaire supporting Katangan separatists.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> responded, “Our
                                best information is that the Katangans have been trained within
                                Angola by the Cubans. We have no direct evidence at all that there
                                are Cubans within Zaire.” (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the

                        <p>6. The appearance of Zaire Air Force planes in the battle caused the
                            first serious signs of demoralization among the Katangan troops. Hurried
                            calls for <gloss target="#t_SAM_1">SAM</gloss>–7 anti-aircraft weapons
                            were sent to Angola and <gloss target="#t_SAM_1">SAM</gloss>–7 weapons
                            were sent to forward units. However, the Katangan troops quickly found
                            that the <gloss target="#t_SAM_1">SAM</gloss>–7’s misfired, jammed, or
                            went wild, and were generally ineffective. Heavy machine guns were then
                            sent from Angola, and these also proved to be ineffective against the
                            aircraft. Though the Zaire aircraft did little damage and caused few
                            casualties, their operations and the failure of the <gloss
                                target="#t_SAM_1">SAM</gloss>–7’s caused serious demoralization
                            among the Katangans and caused the troops to refuse to proceed beyond
                            Mutshasa without heavier weapons.</p>
                        <p>7. Another reason the troops refused to advance from Mutshasa was that it
                            was also becoming apparent to the Katangans that expected African
                            support for the invasion had not materialized and that <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> was still entrenched in power.
                            Furthermore Angola’s support for the invasion was beginning to waver and
                            those few <gloss target="#t_FAPLA_1">FAPLA</gloss> officers who had been
                            with the Katangans were ordered to return to Angola in mid-April. There
                            was a general feeling among the troops in mid-April that they were being
                            abandoned because they had not won a quick victory.</p>
                        <p>8. When the Moroccan intervention was announced, the Katangan leadership
                            was caught by surprise and many of the troops wanted to flee. They
                            refused to press forward against the Moroccans without the armored
                            vehicles, tanks and the Angolan intervention which had been promised.
                            Katangan leader General <persName corresp="#p_MN_1">Nathaniel
                                Mbumba</persName> went to Luanda to plead for support from Angolan
                            President <persName corresp="#p_NAA_1">Agostinho Neto</persName> but was
                            told that the Moroccan intervention had created a new set of
                            circumstances and that Angola could no longer provide the promised
                            support. When this became known at the front, plans were formulated to
                            prepare for insurgent operations, but large numbers of Katangan troops
                            began fleeing to Zambia or Angola. Those who fled said that they had
                            fought against the colonialists, in the Angola civil war, and against
                                <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>, and had no real hope
                            of success against the Moroccans. They were afraid and tired of more
                            fighting. Those who stayed were ordered to resist the Moroccans where
                            possible, to make plans for insurgent operations, and to retreat as
                            necessary back to Angola to <pb n="260" facs="0292" xml:id="pg_260"
                            />reorganize. It is estimated that about half of the Katangan invaders
                            followed these orders and that the others fled or disappeared into the
                            bush.</p>
                        <p>9. Those Katangan gendarmes now in refugee camps in Zambia are tired of
                            fighting and are considering means to go back to Zaire, make their peace
                            with the <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> government, and
                            live a normal life.</p>

                        <p>1. US and Congolese delegations met this morning at <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> Foreign Ministry and agreed to issue

                            ending suspension of relations.</p>
                        <p>2. In discussions, which lasted one and a half hours, Ambassador

                            Diplomatic Relations; (2) compensation for US firms nationalized by

                            affairs. Congolese agreed to all points and raised no substantive issue
                            of their own. They agreed to draft communique presented by US side with
                            only minor modifications.</p>
                        <p>3. Text of communique to be released simultaneously in both capitals June

                            June 6, 1977. As a result of this meeting, the Governments of the United
                            States of America and the People’s Republic of the Congo have agreed to
                            put an end to the suspension of their diplomatic relations as of June 7,
                            1977, and to reopen their embassies in Brazzaville and Washington.</p>
                        <p>The two governments express their hope that this step will strengthen
                            relations between their countries and contribute substantially to
                            bettering their mutual understanding and cooperation based on the

                            non-interference in internal affairs. In this connection, the two
                            governments reaffirm their adherence to the principles of international
                            law, and, in particular, to the provisions of the Vienna Convention on

                            met June 6, 1977, in Bonn. The discussion took place in an atmosphere of
                            frankness and mutual understanding.</p>
                        <p>The two delegations thank the Government of the Federal Republic of

                        <p>5. Comment: Although they had no substantive points to raise Congolese
                            evidently not willing to authorize release of joint communique ending
                            suspension of diplomatic relations for two reasons:</p>
                        <p>1) They prefer it to emanate from Brazzaville and Washington rather than
                            third capital;</p>
                        <p>2) The need for <persName corresp="#p_OT_1">Obenga</persName>, although
                            he did not say so directly, to associate his government and party
                            leadership with text when he returns to Brazzaville.</p>
                        <p>6. Although in his remarks <persName corresp="#p_OT_1">Obenga</persName>
                            several times alluded to “economic, scientific and technological
                            cooperation,” no direct statement about US assistance was made.</p>
                        <p>7. Later Germans told us that Congolese indicated they wanted first
                            contacts with us to be political. Economic questions would be taken up
                            later.</p>

                                corresp="#p_NK_1">Nguza</persName>.</p>
                        <p>1. Zairian radio announced at noon today the arrest of Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_NK_1">Nguza</persName>, recalled from Europe
                            yesterday, on charges of treason. <persName corresp="#p_NK_1"
                                >Nguza</persName> is accused of having learned from Congolese
                            National Liberation Front (FLNC) official Kibwe, during <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>’s January-February visit to
                            Europe, of FLNC plans to invade Shaba in March, and of having concealed
                            that information from the President. The radio also reports that
                                <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> became aware of
                                <persName corresp="#p_NK_1">Nguza</persName>’s “treachery” during
                            early July (i.e., before <persName corresp="#p_NK_1">Nguza</persName>
                            left for Washington), but chose to watch him closely before ordering his
                            arrest.</p>
                        <p>2. In addition, radio announced arrest of Lunda Paramount Chief Mwant
                            Yav, seized with documents in his possession indicating ties with FLNC
                            leader <persName corresp="#p_MN_1">Mbumba</persName>.</p>
                        <p>3. Comment: <persName corresp="#p_NK_1">Nguza</persName>’s arrest comes
                            as total surprise to foreign observers here and, apparently, to most
                            Zairians as well. While in announcing Sambwa’s dismissal earlier this
                            week <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> made clear other
                            heads would soon roll,<note n="2" xml:id="d90fn2">The Embassy reported

                                corresp="#p_NK_1">Nguza</persName>’s name was high on the list. We
                            expect others will follow in what looks like major purge of all those
                            suspected of having wavered in their fidelity to <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> when he appeared to be on the
                            way out. Fact that <persName corresp="#p_NK_1">Nguza</persName> had just
                            returned from U.S. as President’s emissary may stimulate speculation
                            that <persName corresp="#p_NK_1">Nguza</persName>’s downfall is in some

                            relations, and in fact could be interpreted as a slap in our direction.
                            So far, however, there is no indication <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"

                                >Carter</persName> administration:</p>
                        <p>—First of all, a message of thanks for all that the US has done in the
                            past for Zaire; a reaffirmation of the true friendship which exists
                            between Zaire and the United States. For over 17 years that friendship
                            has been constant. Please reassure President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> that, from the Zairian side,
                            this friendship will never lag.</p>
                        <p>—Secondly, President <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> wants
                            the Secretary to know how much he appreciated the way in which General
                            Babia was recently received at various levels of the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>.<note n="2" xml:id="d92fn2">Not

                        <p>—Then Umba launched into the <persName corresp="#p_NK_1">Nguza</persName>
                                affair.<note n="3" xml:id="d92fn3">See <ref target="#d90">Document
                                    90</ref>.</note> Clearly, <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> wants to make the point that our relations are
                            based on institutions and not on individuals, like <persName
                                corresp="#p_NK_1">Nguza</persName>—and the point that he, <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>, hopes that the <persName
                                corresp="#p_NK_1">Nguza</persName> affair will not negatively impact
                            upon those relations. Umba related <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName>’s points and concerns as follows:</p>
                        <p>—Thank you for the welcome you offered to my predecessor, <persName
                                corresp="#p_NK_1">Nguza</persName>.<note n="4" xml:id="d92fn4">See
                                    <ref target="#d89">Document 89</ref>.</note> That welcome, we
                            know was to a man who was a special envoy of President <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>.</p>
                        <p><pb n="267" facs="0299" xml:id="pg_267"/>—President <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> asked me to dispel any
                            ambiguity which might surround the fact that <persName corresp="#p_NK_1"
                                >Nguza</persName> was accused of treason just after his visit to the
                            U.S.</p>
                        <p>—<persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> was not aware of
                                <persName corresp="#p_NK_1">Nguza</persName>’s treason when he sent
                            him to the U.S. and it was only after he left that the full facts were
                            known. <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> did not feel he
                            could recall him and thus allowed him to terminate his mission to
                            America; indeed he allowed him then to go on to Holland for medical
                            treatment. And only after <persName corresp="#p_NK_1">Nguza</persName>
                            was feeling better did the President instruct him to return to
                            Zaire.</p>
                        <p>—Thus, the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> should in no way believe
                            that the <persName corresp="#p_NK_1">Nguza</persName> affair has
                            anything to do with the United States. Our relations are based upon
                            institutions, not personalities. In example, it is not now I who speak
                            to you, but rather President <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> who has asked me to relay this message.</p>
                        <p>—President <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> has also asked
                            me to relay his profound thanks for the ways in which you made known the
                            American concern for <persName corresp="#p_NK_1">Nguza</persName>’s
                            fate. Certain other countries (he refers to Belgium) overstated their
                            case and did so in a public and unhelpful manner. The U.S. interventions
                            on behalf of <persName corresp="#p_NK_1">Nguza</persName>, on the other
                            hand, were handled through normal diplomatic channels.<note n="5"

                                out that a “speedy and fair trial of <persName corresp="#p_NK_1"
                                    >Nguza</persName> would be best indication that <persName
                                    corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> intends to fully implement
                                reforms, especially in the area of human rights.” (National
                                Archives, RG 59, Central Foreign Policy File,
                            D770296–0060)</note></p>
                        <p>—Then Umba went to the question of <persName corresp="#p_NK_1"
                                >Nguza</persName>’s guilt, pointing out that whatever we might
                            believe on this subject—<persName corresp="#p_NK_1">Nguza</persName>
                            confessed his treason in the letter he wrote to President <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> asking for clemency.</p>
                        <p>—Umba also showed the Secretary a regular Zairian passport delivered to
                                <persName corresp="#p_NK_1">Nguza</persName> by the Zairian Embassy
                            in The Hague on 3 July 1977, whereas <persName corresp="#p_NK_1"
                                >Nguza</persName> carried and had the right to carry a diplomatic
                            passport. Umba speculated that <persName corresp="#p_NK_1"
                                >Nguza</persName> knew he was guilty and wanted to anticipate
                            trouble.</p>
                        <p>—Without missing a beat, Umba then turned to “bilateral relations.” He
                            allowed that the Secretary almost certainly knew what he was going to
                            say concerning certain problems in the Zairian economy, but <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> thought it important to
                            reiterate the points through his Foreign Minister.</p>
                        <p>—In spite of the very considerable efforts Zaire has made to live up to
                            the economic stabilization program—and the <gloss target="#t_IMF_1"
                                >IMF</gloss> can attest to our success in this regard—this austerity
                            has been imposed at enormous sacrifice and to little evident economic
                            effect.</p>
                        <p><pb n="268" facs="0300" xml:id="pg_268"/>—The economic situation remains
                            extremely difficult; copper prices are down, inflation up. There are
                            strikes. The balance of payments gap means a further reduction of
                            imports and then the prospect of more inflation and labor troubles.</p>
                        <p>—Zaire is talking with a number of friendly countries, asking them for
                            additional assistance. But US influence is such that these governments
                            will not move unless they see a real American interest in Zairian
                            economic recovery.</p>
                        <p>—However, if the economic picture is bad, the political scene is in very
                            good shape. During the Shaba war many commentators said that it was an
                            “internal” matter. Umba asked rhetorically if, since the invaders were
                            repulsed, one now heard of continued conflict in Shaba.</p>
                        <p>—But beyond the basic political stability is the important fact that the
                            political reforms announced by President <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> are being applied. The electoral campaign, for
                            example, is in full swing.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VC_1">Vance</persName> interjected to say
                            that he was very pleased to hear of the program of political reform, and
                            interested to see that it goes forward and becomes a reality as soon as
                            possible.</p>
                        <p>—Umba said that the electoral campaigns were under way now, but
                            emphasized President <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>’s
                            prediction that the ex-Katangan Gendarmes would probably try to cause
                            trouble in order to sabotage political reforms. Umba said that the
                            Katangans’ commando training continued and that they continue to
                            infiltrate anti-regime groups.</p>
                        <p>—The Secretary asked if the GOZ expected such attacks only in the Shaba,
                            or in other parts of Zaire as well? Umba believes that the initial
                            attacks will come in the Shaba, but that they may be followed by forays
                            into neighboring provinces.</p>
                        <p>—Umba went on to say that the leading Zairian oppositionists are now in
                            Algiers and that their plans included infiltration through Zambia. The
                            Secretary asked if <persName corresp="#p_NAA_1">Neto</persName> was
                            aware and approved of the Katangan plans? Umba said that given the
                            numbers of Katangans on Angolan soil, we must assume that <persName
                                corresp="#p_NAA_1">Neto</persName> is aware of this and their plans.
                            Then Umba offered a personal opinion to the effect the Katangans had
                            begun to bother <persName corresp="#p_NAA_1">Neto</persName>—they were
                            stealing his diamonds—and thus he simply wanted them out of Angola. Umba
                            finished off this part of the conversation by saying that he and
                            Ambassador Kasango had just seen the Zambian Foreign Minister who
                            assured them that Zambian territory would never be used to allow
                            Katangan infiltration into the Shaba.</p>
                        <p>—Umba finally terminated his near monologue by complaining that in spite
                            of the 17 year old friendship between the US and Zaire—in spite of the
                            fact that Zaire would not be independent today, within its present
                            borders if the US had not intervened in the early sixties—<pb n="269"
                                facs="0301" xml:id="pg_269"/>in spite of all this “we have the
                            impression that you are ashamed of being Zaire’s friends.”</p>
                        <p>—Your enemies are better treated than your friends, like Zaire, Umba
                            continued. You continue to make clear your commitments to Israel and to
                            South Korea. “Are we not friends on the same plane as they?”, the
                            Foreign Minister asked.</p>
                        <p>—Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VC_1">Vance</persName> then responded to
                            Umba’s points:</p>
                        <p>—We share President <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>’s
                            desire to strengthen and to improve our relations. Indeed, we have
                            worked closely together for the last 17 years and we hope and expect
                            that this close cooperation will continue in the future.</p>
                        <p>—We appreciate President <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>’s
                            message. Please convey to him our thanks for his prompt support for the

                        <p>—I am also convinced of the necessity of economic reforms under <gloss
                                target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss> leadership. These are very important
                            and we want to continue to work with you in implementing these
                            reforms.</p>
                        <p>—On the military side, we have recently approved the use of FY 1977
                                <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> funds for the purchase of a
                            stock of M–16 ammunition as well as for tents, medicines, C–rations and
                            other basic supplies.<note n="8" xml:id="d92fn8">In telegram 223964 to

                            are working together to come up with the right equipment to fit into
                            your military reform plans. And in this regard we have discussed further
                            military needs with the Belgians and the French. We seem to be in
                            agreement on your needs and on the question of the relative supply role
                            of each of us. We have eliminated, as you <pb n="270" facs="0302"
                                xml:id="pg_270"/>know, certain items such as tanks, but these do not
                            seem to us to be the kind of equipment you need in a Shaba-type
                            situation. Other elements of our initial package will be continued,
                            however and our two governments are working out the details.</p>
                        <p>—We are certainly not embarrassed over the good relations our two
                            countries have enjoyed over the years.</p>
                        <p>—Our relations have been forged from mutual respect and mutual
                            confidence—and these are the bases from which our relations will proceed
                            in the future.</p>
                        <p>—Umba thanked the Secretary and in his closing minutes tried to point out
                            that while Zaire’s critics always emphasized corruption, it was fair to
                            say that no country was free from corruption. So too for the criticism
                            aimed at Zaire’s inefficient administration. Zaire is a young and
                            developing country. President <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> is determined to push through his political and
                            economic reforms—but “we need encouragement.”</p>
                        <p>—The Secretary did not respond directly to this last point and the
                            meeting which had run well over the allotted time terminated amid
                            expression of courtesy from both participants.</p>

                            attend Foreign Minister Umba’s meeting with Secretary <persName

                            had therefore arranged to follow up on certain points with Umba. After
                            initial courtesies, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRM_1">Moose</persName>
                            led off the discussion by making the following points:</p>
                        <p>—You and other Zairian representatives have told us recently that
                            President <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> was pleased
                            that we had directed our interventions <pb n="271" facs="0303"
                                xml:id="pg_271"/>on <persName corresp="#p_NK_1">Nguza</persName>’s
                            behalf through normal diplomatic channels,<note n="3" xml:id="d93fn3"
                                >See <ref target="#d92fn5">footnote 5, Document 92</ref>.</note> as
                            opposed to other governments who had gone public, and that the
                            President’s decision to commute <persName corresp="#p_NK_1"
                                >Nguza</persName>’s sentence reflected our intervention.<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d93fn4">In telegram 8881 from Kinshasa, September 15, the
                                Embassy reported the September 15 news broadcast that gave an
                                account of <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>’s
                                commutation of <persName corresp="#p_NK_1">Nguza</persName>’s death
                                sentence to life imprisonment. (National Archives, RG 59, Central
                                Foreign Policy File, D770335–0492)</note></p>
                        <p>—We will always try to handle problems quietly, but at times issues such
                            as the <persName corresp="#p_NK_1">Nguza</persName> affair can get out
                            of control. For example, Belgian human rights lawyer Wolf came to
                            Washington last week with the intention of making the <persName
                                corresp="#p_NK_1">Nguza</persName> affair a public issue.</p>
                        <p>—This, in our view, would have been unfortunate, and we were able to
                            persuade Wolf that such an action would be unhelpful. But we also told
                            him that we too were concerned over <persName corresp="#p_NK_1"
                                >Nguza</persName>’s ultimate fate, especially in the light of
                            reports that his health was bad.<note n="5" xml:id="d93fn5">In telegram
                                244207 to Kinshasa, October 12, the Department reported on the

                                Wolf, in which <persName corresp="#p_WL_1">Walker</persName> assured
                                Wolf that the U.S. Government was “deeply concerned about the
                                well-being of <persName corresp="#p_NK_1">Nguza</persName>” but
                                stressed “the need to avoid public pressure on <persName
                                    corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>” that “risks making matters

                        <p>—I recount all of this to show you how we are trying to keep the
                                <persName corresp="#p_NK_1">Nguza</persName> affair from becoming a
                            public issue between our two countries.</p>
                        <p>—But I also want to emphasize that there is considerable concern over the
                                <persName corresp="#p_NK_1">Nguza</persName> affair in the Congress,
                            the American press and among human rights advocates in general. And
                            thus, the <persName corresp="#p_NK_1">Nguza</persName> affair remains an
                            important element in our relations.</p>
                        <p>—We have confidence in President <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName>’s political acumen and in his humanitarian
                            virtues. We believe that the decisions he will ultimately take in this
                            case—sovereign decisions—will take into account the various factors at
                            play.</p>
                        <p>—Umba took all this in and clearly got the message that while we were
                            pleased with <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>’s decision
                            to commute <persName corresp="#p_NK_1">Nguza</persName>’s death
                            sentence, we expected that President <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> would make additional, humane decisions in the
                            ex-Foreign Minister’s regard. Umba went back over the accusations
                            against <persName corresp="#p_NK_1">Nguza</persName>, pointed out that
                                <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> was the one who had
                            been most personally touched by the treason of a close collaborator and
                            tried to pin <persName corresp="#p_MRM_1">Moose</persName> down as to
                            just what more the U.S. expected <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> to do.</p>
                        <p>—<persName corresp="#p_MRM_1">Moose</persName> did not bite, but rather
                            reiterated our confidence in <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName>’s judgment—sovereign judgment.</p>

                        <p>—Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRM_1">Moose</persName> then addressed a major
                            preoccupation of Zaire, that concerning the changing nature of the
                            relationship.</p>
                        <p>—You said to the Secretary that it seemed the US was ashamed of its
                            friendship with Zaire. The Secretary responded that such was not the
                            case and the next day President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                >Carter</persName> told you that we were proud of our relationship
                            with Zaire, and I want to reiterate these sentiments.<note n="6"

                        <p>—At the same time, you should understand that our friendship can be put
                            in an embarrassing situation. For example, during the Shaba war when
                            congressional and US opinion feared too deep an American involvement
                            certain very real constraints were placed upon our ability to respond to
                            the requests of an old friend.<note n="7" xml:id="d93fn7">See <ref

                        <p>—These are political facts with which we both have to deal and as long as
                            we are both aware of the constraints, we can indeed work together.</p>
                        <p>—In this regard, and as the Secretary pointed out, progress on political,
                            economic and military reforms in Zaire is the surest base from which the
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> can continue to marshal support
                            for your country. I cannot overemphasize this point.</p>
                        <p>—Umba thanked <persName corresp="#p_MRM_1">Moose</persName> for his
                            frankness and said that it was this kind of open discussion which
                            cleared the air and allowed both sides to proceed with a better
                            understanding of the factors at play. Umba was especially appreciative

                            congressional and executive concerns over Zaire, the image problem from
                            which Zaire suffered and the very real need to improve that image
                            through concrete reforms.</p>

                                >FMS</gloss>:</p>
                        <p>—As the Secretary pointed out, we consider our recent decisions on
                            military supply to be a gauge of our desire for good relations.</p>
                        <p>But there is one point I have made to Ambassador Kasongo and which I
                            would like to reiterate with you: There is profound congressional
                            concern that US military equipment supplied to Zaire might be
                            transferred to <gloss target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss> or other Angolan
                            opposition groups.<note n="8" xml:id="d93fn8">In telegram 243083 to

                                transfer arms to <gloss target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss>. (National

                        <p><pb n="273" facs="0305" xml:id="pg_273"/>—We do not believe this to be
                            Zaire’s intention, but given congressional attitudes, we must make the
                            point concerning third country transfers.</p>
                        <p>—I might also point out that we consider the approval of M–16 ammunition
                            to be a one-time transaction. In other words, the 10 million rounds
                            should last you indefinitely or through any forseeable contingency. We
                            do not expect to receive future requests for M–16 ammo.</p>
                        <p>—Umba said he understood perfectly and pointed out that Ambassador
                            Kasongo had already transmitted <persName corresp="#p_MRM_1"
                                >Moose</persName>’s previous demarche on this subject to President
                                <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>. He reassured us that
                            we need have no fear concerning unauthorized third country
                            transfers.</p>
                        <p>—Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WL_1">Walker</persName> said that during his
                            briefings of Congress concerning our M–16 ammo decisions, he had found
                            great concern over reports that Zaire was on the verge of reinstituting
                            its assistance to <gloss target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss>. These
                            congressional contacts had pointed out that if such were to prove to be
                            the case, all bilateral programs with Zaire could be in jeopardy. Umba
                            said he got the point and would relay it to <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"

                        <p>—At the end of the conversation, Umba said that President <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> had instructed him to intervene

                                D770407–0908)</note> Umba implied that Belgium and African states
                            had asked <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> to undertake
                            this demarche since they all believed it important that the US remain
                            within the organization and “not allow the Communists to take over.”
                            Umba offered to call on George Meany while he was in the US—if that
                            would be helpful.</p>

                                Ramadan, which started on August 15. (National Archives, RG 59,
                                Central Foreign Policy File, D770262–1160)</note> has concluded that
                            Sudan’s most pressing defense need is for an improved air defense
                            capability, including early warning radar and interceptor aircraft. This
                            conclusion is consistent with the December 1976 Sudanese request for
                            F–5’s and associated radar. Although the report does not specifically
                            recommend the acquisition of U.S. equipment, its presentation to the
                            Sudanese later this month is expected to trigger an early reiteration of
                            Sudan’s past request for F–5s and associated equipment. We therefore
                            must consider our response to the anticipated Sudanese request.</p>
                        <p>I recommend that you approve the sale of one squadron of F–5’s and
                            associated air defense radar. These together with a training program
                            would be the most significant U.S. contributions to an initial 2–3 year
                            phase of a multi-year military improvement program. U.S. participation
                            if any in subsequent phases will be subject to later review. The cost of
                            the aircraft would be about $78 million and the radar $31 million. Sudan

                            the sale can not proceed.</p>
                        <p>I believe we should agree to this sale because:</p>
                        <p>—it will add new momentum to improving U.S.-Sudanese relations;</p>
                        <p>—it will be welcomed by the Saudis and others as a sign of U.S. support
                            for moderate Arab and African regimes;</p>
                        <p>—it responds in a modest way to a projected imbalance in aircraft
                            inventories between Sudan and Ethiopia without trying to match the
                            magnitude of Soviet deliveries to Ethiopia.</p>
                        <p>The sale would be consistent with our arms transfer guidelines.</p>
                        <p><pb n="276" facs="0308" xml:id="pg_276"/>—it will not introduce into the
                            region a higher level of combat capability. F–5’s are already in the
                            inventories of Kenya, Ethiopia, and Saudi Arabia. Ethiopia is awaiting
                            and Libya already has the longer-range MIG–23.</p>
                        <p>—the number of U.S. military personnel required to support the sale would
                            be only about 10 for two years, with another 6 contract or <gloss

                        <p>We have also considered diplomatic steps which we might take to stabilize
                            the Angola-Zaire border situation. Our concern is that military
                            assistance from French, Belgian and Moroccan sources being funneled
                            through Zaire to <gloss target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss> may prompt

                            that we cannot dissuade the French and Belgians from their view that
                            their long-term interests are served by an ultimate <persName

                            useful, and I have gained a much clearer impression of Zaire’s problems

                            outside specialists to exercise authority in the central bank and the

                            repatriation and budgetary control.</p>
                        <p>We welcome the role the Belgian Government has played in coordinating the

                                7720 from Brussels, April 20, the Embassy transmitted Belgian
                                Foreign Minister Simonet’s invitation to <persName corresp="#p_VC_1"
                                    >Vance</persName> to participate in an international conference
                                on implementation of economic reforms in Zaire. (National Archives,

                        <p>1. In view of the Belgian invitation to a prospective donors’ conference
                                (<gloss target="#t_reftel_1">reftel</gloss>), the Embassy believes
                            addressees might find useful some background to Zaire’s economic
                            problems, some definitions of terminology, and a report on the status of
                            implementation of economic reforms.</p>
                        <p>2. Causes for the current economic problems: Taking advantage of high
                            commodity prices of the early 1970’s, Zaire embarked on an overly
                            ambitious development program, accompanied by numerous prestige projects
                            and with little management control. During the same period it also
                            undertook an extensive nationalization program which resulted in a
                            drastic decline in industrial and agricultural production as well as
                            disruption of normal commercial supply channels. As long as commodity
                            prices remained high, Zaire had no problem borrowing to meet its foreign
                            exchange deficit. However, in late 1974 there was a general decline in
                            commodity prices and a particularly steep fall in the price of copper,
                            Zaire’s primary export. At the same time, prices for imported petroleum
                            products more than tripled. In 1975, the Benguela Railroad, the
                            principal supply and evacuation route through Angola for Zaire’s
                            minerals, was closed, adversely affecting production levels and
                            increasing costs. Prospects for the railroad’s reopening are still poor.
                            As a result of all these factors, Zaire’s foreign exchange reserves were
                            effectively exhausted in 1975.</p>
                        <p>3. Stabilization program: The <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> and
                            other traditional donor countries informed Zaire that any additional
                            economic assistance would be dependent upon Zaire’s undertaking
                            self-help measures. In August 1975 Zaire requested the assistance of the
                                <gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss> in preparing a stabilization
                            program and began to implement a number of measures designed to bring
                            about economic recovery. These measures, together with an <gloss
                                target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss> standby signed in March 1976 and
                            another <gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss> standby <pb n="280"
                                facs="0312" xml:id="pg_280"/>signed in March 1977, have been the
                            essence of the stabilization program.</p>
                        <p>4. Self-help measures: The most important of the self-help measures which
                            Zaire has undertaken are the following:</p>
                        <p>A. Devaluation: In February 1976 Zaire devalued its currency by
                            approximately 42 per cent. However, continuing inflation coupled with
                            import shortages and economic stagnation have brought about a situation
                            where the zaire is once again seriously over-valued on the official
                            market.</p>
                        <p>B. Retrocession: In late 1976 Zaire began a process, now virtually
                            completed, whereby up to 60 per cent of the equity ownership in major
                            nationalized industrial, agricultural and commercial enterprises would
                            be returned to the original owners.</p>
                        <p>C. <gloss target="#t_OGEDEP_1">OGEDEP</gloss>: In 1976 Zaire created an
                            Office of Debt Management (<gloss target="#t_OGEDEP_1">OGEDEP</gloss>),
                            which inventories and monitors all GOZ debt. This office has only
                            recently begun to function fully.</p>
                        <p>5. <gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss> agreements: Zaire did not comply
                            with the provisions of the 1976 standby, in that the budgetary deficit
                            considerably exceeded the agreed-upon target—primarily because of
                            greater than-anticipated GOZ expenditures. Partly as a result, inflation
                            in 1976 was approximately 80 percent. Following a review in October
                            1977, the <gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss> again found Zaire not to
                            be in compliance with the provisions of the standby signed in March
                            1977. Although the <gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss> found
                            extenuating circumstances in that the price of copper was less than had
                            been assumed and no proceeds had been received from the anticipated
                            private bank loan, the budget deficit was again considerably beyond the
                            agreed-upon target, again because of greater-than-anticipated GOZ
                            expenditures. The GOZ and the <gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss> have
                            had several consultations and are expected to negotiate the terms of a
                            new standby agreement in May.</p>
                        <p>6. Official debt rescheduling: In 1976 the <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> and Zaire’s other major Western creditors, under the
                            auspices of the Paris Club, agreed to reschedule a substantial portion
                            of 1975 official arrearages and a major portion of interest and
                            principal payments coming due in 1976. In 1977 the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> and other major Western creditors
                            agreed to another generous rescheduling concerning most official
                            payments coming due that year. They also agreed that they would consider
                            the same generous terms for 1978, provided that Zaire concluded a
                            comparable agreement with its private creditors, concluded a new <gloss
                                target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss> standby, and made its best efforts to
                            abide by the terms of the previous rescheduling agreements. Although
                            Zaire has made an effort to comply with the terms of the two previous
                            rescheduling agreements, it has not yet reached an agreement with its
                            private creditors, nor has it signed a new standby. However, it is
                            expected that these two conditions will <pb n="281" facs="0313"
                                xml:id="pg_281"/>be satisfied in the near future and a Paris Club
                            meeting to consider 1978 obligations is expected to follow soon
                            thereafter.</p>
                        <p>7. London bank agreement: In November 1976 Zaire reached an agreement in
                            principle with the private banks which were the managers of its
                            syndicated loans. Under the terms of the agreement, if Zaire became
                            current in interest and principal payments due these banks under the
                            syndicated loans, then the banks would make their best efforts to raise
                            up to $250 million in medium-term credits. In July 1977, Zaire
                            essentially complied with its obligations under the London agreement.
                            But, because of the Shaba invasion and other factors, including a change
                            in the Governor of the Central Bank, the private banks by that time had
                            not been able to raise a significant new loan for Zaire. However, it is
                            expected that in the near future these private banks and the GOZ will
                            conclude a five-year credit for approximately $220 million. Disbursement
                            will be contingent upon the GOZ being current in all payments due to
                            banks under syndicated loans and on the conclusion of an <gloss
                                target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss> standby.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> Plan: Following the
                            1977 Shaba war President <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>
                            spoke of a “Marshall Plan” to assist in the economic recovery of

                            restore the economy through a combination of self-help measures and

                                Group meeting, held June 8–10, 1977, in which Zaire’s Minister of
                                State for Finance Bofassa first called for a “Marshall Plan” for
                                Zaire. (National Archives, RG 59, Central Foreign Policy File,
                                D770212–0498)</note> He asked the Belgians to help in the
                            preparation of the plan and to serve as coordinators in soliciting
                            assistance from other donors. Funds from foreign donors are to be
                            channeled and coordinated through the <gloss target="#t_IBRD_1"
                                >IBRD</gloss>. Although not yet completed, the plan is essentially a
                            three-year program designed to ensure better fiscal and monetary
                            management and development of priority projects in key sectors of the
                            economy such as agriculture, transportation, mining and energy. The main
                            aspect of the <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> Plan yet to
                            be completed is the financial section which will reflect key elements of
                            the contemplated <gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss> standby. The major
                            self-help measures contemplated by Zaire will be better fiscal and
                            monetary control. In this connection, the GOZ has requested the <gloss
                                target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss> to provide experts for the Central
                            Bank, and the GOZ and <gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss> reportedly
                            have agreed upon the powers of a team at the Central Bank which will
                            essentially control foreign exchange allocation. Likewise, it is
                            contemplated that foreign experts will be placed in the Ministry of
                            Finance, particularly in the <pb n="282" facs="0314" xml:id="pg_282"
                            />customs division where fiscal irregularities are notorious. The GOZ
                            already has put foreign experts in control of its essential rail and
                            river transportation systems and, as a result, productivity of the
                            transportation sector has increased significantly. It is hoped that
                            similar effectiveness will result from placing expatriates in the
                            Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>Principal points and assignments made were as follows:</p>
                        <p>In the Intelligence area the radio blackout was noted and State is to
                            check with the GOZ concerning the situation at the Base Camp. <gloss
                                target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> is to produce maps and photographs of
                            the Kolwezi area. [<hi rend="italic">3 lines not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>With regard to the evacuation of American citizens, the situation is
                            unclear. State is to look into the possibility of sending cars in from
                            Lubumbashi. <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> said that an air drop
                            into the Kolwezi to seize the airport and rescue Americans could take
                            place in 66½ hours from the time it was ordered. If troops were on alert
                            this would be reduced by 18 hours. The advisability of putting troops on
                            alert will be decided later. <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> will
                            also look at a smaller military option, putting a company-size force in
                            to defend the Americans in place. It will also check on aircraft
                            availability to effect an unopposed evacuation. State is to press French
                            and Belgians on their evacuation plans.</p>
                        <p><pb n="284" facs="0316" xml:id="pg_284"/>In the area of military supply,
                            Defense said it would have a good fix on availabilities and requirements
                            by Wednesday morning. They will see what they can do to expedite flow of
                            critical items both in terms of rapid movement and reprogramming within
                            the FY 1978 orders.</p>
                        <p>We will keep Congress informed and if we decide to go to military alert
                            will brief them. We will be developing public statements later this
                            afternoon.</p>
                        <p>In addition to close consultation with the French and Belgians,
                            diplomatic activities will include keeping selected African states
                            briefed on the situation and contacting the Angolans and Portuguese.</p>

                            base outside the combat area. In addition, the Belgians have asked us

                        <p>The following major points were developed in a meeting this afternoon on
                                Zaire:<note n="2" xml:id="d106fn2">No minutes of this meeting have
                                been found.</note></p>
                        <p>1. <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> gave the judgment that the
                            Katangans can repeat incursions into Shaba in the future, and the <gloss
                                target="#t_FAZ_1">FAZ</gloss> probably cannot prevent them.</p>
                        <p>2. State reviewed the French efforts as indicating movement toward a
                            French-African peace-keeping force, but this is merely an inference. The
                            rundown on the Belgians intentions was taken largely from the recent
                            Belgian cable asking for a swift reply on the U.S. attitude toward an
                            international peace-keeping force in Shaba.<note n="3" xml:id="d106fn3"
                                >In telegram 9852 from Brussels, May 22, the Embassy reported that
                                Simonet had asked “if the United States would support or participate
                                in the formation of an international force to provide security for
                                Shaba.” (National Archives, RG 59, Central Foreign Policy File,
                                D780215–0740)</note> The most useful force, it was observed, would
                            be one along the border which can detect Katangese incursions early.</p>
                        <p>3. The Zaire economy can be expected to spiral downward with the exodus
                            of Europeans which will continue from all parts of Zaire unless the
                            security situation can be changed. In a word, the outlook for the
                            economy is disastrous.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_LWA_1">Tony Lake</persName> suggested we review
                            the long term policy implications, but for the shorter run we must work
                            up a package of economic and military support for Zaire, demanding
                            reforms so that <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> cannot
                            waste the time gained as he has the past year since the first Katangese
                            incursion.</p>
                        <p>5. A number of ramifications of U.S., <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss>, French, Belgian, and African involvement in Zaire
                            were discussed against the previous statements of the situation and
                            proposals for U.S. action.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_AD_1">David Aaron</persName> summed up the
                            meeting with the following points:</p>
                        <quote><p><pb n="290" facs="0322" xml:id="pg_290"/>a. We can render
                                political support for an international peace-keeping effort but at
                                present we cannot make a commitment of material support.</p>
                            <p>b. We face no request for aid now with the possible exception of
                                Babia’s mention of a joint French/Zaire query. That must be
                                clarified as to whether it is in fact a formal Zairian request.</p>
                            <p>c. We need to produce a policy paper reviewing the longer term
                                implications for the U.S. and its allies in Zaire.</p>
                            <p>d. We should draw the French and the Belgians out on their longer
                                term intentions.</p></quote>
                        <p>7. Two outputs to be accomplished are:</p>
                        <quote><p>a. A cable to Belgium answering the questions on peace-keeping to
                                the effect we offer political support to an international
                                peace-keeping effort.</p>
                            <p>b. State’s policy paper on the longer term.</p></quote>
                        <p>8. The meeting also discussed briefly State’s desire not to deliver a
                            bill for the costs of the U.S. forces to the French and Belgians at
                            present. <persName corresp="#p_AD_1">David Aaron</persName> asked, on
                            another matter, that <gloss target="#t_DIA_1">DIA</gloss>/[<hi

                            there was considerable discussion of the U.S. intermediate and longer

                            and diplomatic steps we might take to ensure Zaire’s solvency; and (b)
                            Zaire is essentially a European-African problem, and our role should be
                            minimal. State is preparing a paper now for interagency review on this
                                subject.<note n="3" xml:id="d107fn3">No paper has been found.</note>
                            The paper is to be ready by Wednesday, and another Working Group meeting
                            is scheduled for Thursday. An <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss>

                        <p>The second major topic of discussion was Zaire’s security situation. It
                            is felt that the Zairean armed forces are not able to provide the
                            essential security environment for the return of the expatriate
                            community to Kolwezi. (It may be that expatriates working elsewhere in
                            the country will take the Shaba conflict as a sign that they ought to
                            leave.) This means great difficulty for Zaire’s economy. It was decided
                            that U.S. support for an international peacekeeping force was a
                            desirable thing; however, we could not decide on the character of our
                            support for an international force until we had a clearer idea of our
                            longer run objectives in Zaire. (We will work with <gloss

                        <p>In a news conference on May 25, 1978, President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJE_1">Jimmy Carter</persName> accused Cuba of playing
                            an active role in the Katangan invasion of Zaire. “We believe that Cuba
                            had known of the Katangan plans to invade and obviously did nothing to
                            restrain them from crossing the border. We also know that the Cubans
                            have played a key role in training and equipping the Katangans who
                            attacked.” (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents: <persName

                            insisted that the Cubans “had had no connection with the Katangans for

                        <p><pb n="293" facs="0325" xml:id="pg_293"/>The decisions that we make now
                            are going to have important long-term consequences. To some extent, our
                            support of the rescue operation has identified us with European attempts
                            to preserve the situation in Zaire. If we now decide to proceed with
                            support of French and Belgian ideas for a much more ambitious political
                            and economic rescue plan, backed up by an international military force,
                            we will have committed ourselves to an undertaking that will be costly
                            with only a 50–50 chance of success. Most important, even the fact of
                            consultations starts us on the road to this commitment.</p>
                        <p>You should be aware that the State Department is inclined to consult
                            first and only incrementally develop issues for your decision. Instead,
                            we have insisted on establishing a framework setting forth the limits of
                            our prospective involvement as guidelines for any such consultations.
                            The <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss> recommendations on this are set
                            forth below.</p>
                        <p>The key issues are:</p>
                        <p>(1) Are we willing to get involved in some measure in an increased
                            long-term development/reconstruction effort?</p>
                        <p>(2) Are we willing to support an international “peacekeeping” effort in
                            Shaba?</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Long-Term Effort</p>
                        <p>Despite the poor prospects for significant reform, there was a general
                                <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss> consensus led by State that
                            Zaire is too important and the global stakes too high for the United
                            States to continue its past posture of marginal support for the Zaire
                            economic effort. It is important to recognize that before the invasion,
                            the United States had given indications that it was prepared to support
                            the <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> plan—a fairly
                            ambitious multinational development effort with a price tag of about
                            $300 million annually, with financing coming from governments and
                            international banks. The disruption in Shaba will add another $150
                            million in short-term costs to that price tag. A multinational planning
                            meeting of donor nations for Zaire has been planned for some time to
                            convene June 14–15 in Brussels.<note n="5" xml:id="d109fn5">See <ref

                                11758 from Brussels, June 14, the Embassy summed up the U.S.
                                position in the meeting: “In sum we refused to commit our $18
                                million <gloss target="#t_PL_1">PL</gloss>–480 package until the
                                Zairians give us some indication of what foreign exchange revenues
                                they foresee over the next three months and how they propose to use
                                them to address essential import priorities.” (National Archives, RG

                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss> recommends that any U.S.
                            contribution to such a program would depend on significant reforms—many
                            of which <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> has already
                            pledged he would undertake.</p>
                        <p><pb n="294" facs="0326" xml:id="pg_294"/>The alternative of not
                            participating in this effort would probably lead to a rapid economic
                            collapse in Zaire and political fragmentation of the country. At the
                            same time, you should be aware that deeper U.S. economic involvement
                            will mean that Zaire will become politically more important to us and,
                            success or failure, strategically more significant. In this connection,
                            everyone agrees that, to the maximum extent possible, we should be
                            junior partners to the Europeans and others in this development
                            program.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Security Situation</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss> agreed that any long-term
                            economic recovery could not take place unless there was an improvement
                            in the security situation. There was agreement that you should be
                            prepared to indicate to Giscard our willingness to provide airlift for
                            elements of an international force. It is also recommended that we
                            assume the costs (in the neighborhood of $20 million for approximately
                            175 C–141 sorties).</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss> also believes that we should
                            respond positively to requests for equipment to replace US-origin items
                            transferred into Zaire for the international force. It was recommended
                            that we be prepared to participate in the financing of such replacement
                            equipment but not assume the entire burden.</p>
                        <p>It was also agreed that while the United States should be prepared to
                            provide some specific, very short-term training or familiarization with
                            certain equipment (i.e., commo gear), we should not station any people
                            in Zaire for maintenance or any other purpose.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Allied Consultations</p>
                        <p>There was consensus that the next step should be to begin consultation
                            with the Belgians and the French on both the security situation and
                            economic reconstruction plans. If you agree with the above principles,
                            that would serve as guidance for such consultations.</p>
                        <p>Your meeting with Giscard would be the first of our consultations. At
                            that meeting, you should try to get him to spell out the extent to which
                            France plans to be involved. If the French are prepared to support the
                                <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> plan and an
                            international peacekeeping force as has been reported, you could
                            indicate in general terms our willingness to do so within the above
                                constraints.<note n="6" xml:id="d109fn6">A White House statement

                            the French desire to expand the results of the conference—through
                            presentations during the meeting and the press statement to include
                            their goals of a Pan-African Intervention Force and the Giscard
                                Fund.<note n="2" xml:id="d111fn2">In telegram 17965 from Paris, June
                                6, the Embassy reported on the details of the June 5 Paris meeting
                                and the debate on the press statement. (National Archives, RG 59,
                                Central Foreign Policy File, D780236–0553) Giscard proposed a
                                Special Fund for African Development, which became known as the
                                Giscard Fund, at a Franco-African summit held in May 1976. For the

                            negotiations the press statement reflected the views we share with the
                            British, the Germans, and the Belgians. French concerns were partially
                            satisfied by a general reference to wider African problems. In addition,
                            a working group produced a report which calculated Zaire’s requirement
                            for urgent imports over the next three months at some $55 million for
                            food, petroleum, and medicines alone. The group was unable to calculate
                            the requirement for spare parts but it is probably in the neighborhood
                            of $5–15 million. There was a firm consensus on the need to press
                                <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> for reforms which
                            would be necessary if foreign assistance is to be forthcoming and
                            effective.</p>
                        <p>The French made an appeal to all present to assist with the ongoing
                            support of the African Force in Shaba. No commitments were made in
                            Paris, but this issue of medium-term support for the African Force will
                            bedevil us in the weeks ahead.</p>

                            of the Republic of Zaire for the assistance my government has extended

                                never ceased to give it from its accession to independence in 1960

                        <p>You raise the problem of Soviet-Cuban activities and intentions in
                            Africa, which greatly concern the United States and other Western
                            governments. I have initiated a review of this question and will be
                            undertaking further appropriate actions when that review is
                                completed.<note n="5" xml:id="d112fn5">See <ref target="#d11"

                        <p>But in the meantime, I wanted to share with you my conviction that the
                            problems of stability in Central Africa go beyond the issues posed by
                            Soviet-Cuban activities. And on the basis of the discussions <pb n="299"
                                facs="0331" xml:id="pg_299"/>held in Paris on June 5, I believe that
                            my analysis is shared by the other governments represented there.
                            Indeed, the Ambassadors of the five powers have already shared with you
                            the main conclusions of the meeting in Paris. Let me be more
                            specific.</p>
                        <p>Between friends, we can speak frankly and address the need for reforms in
                            Zaire. Your own public declarations on this subject have come to form
                            the framework of needed reforms in the political as well as the economic
                            fields. Both you and your foreign friends are in agreement that these
                            reforms are urgent.</p>
                        <p>To summarize my understanding of what we have agreed thus far: on the
                            economic front, a new stabilization agreement with the International
                            Monetary Fund must be signed just as soon as possible and it is
                            understood that continued bilateral assistance will be related to
                            performance under the terms of the agreement. We have also agreed on the
                            reforms you set forth in the “<persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"

                                necessary to assist Zaire to implement its plan for economic and
                                financial recovery: “management reorganization, economic and
                                financial stabilization, revitalized production, particularly in the

                        <p>As I review the elements of the economic reform package, I am struck by
                            the common concern, not only in the <gloss target="#t_IMF_1"
                            >IMF</gloss>-led stabilization effort, but also in the <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> Plan, over control and
                            repatriation of foreign exchange.</p>
                        <p>As you know, both the stabilization plan and the recovery plan cannot be
                            put in place overnight, yet the urgency of economic reform is such that
                            something must be done quickly to give the signal that the process is
                            being implemented. This is particularly important from the American
                            viewpoint where our Congress will want to see evidence of reform before
                            we can envisage further assistance. In this regard, you might wish to
                            consider putting into place an interim system for assuring that foreign
                            exchange receipts are repatriated to Zaire’s essential import
                            requirements. You may have other ideas which would get across the <pb
                                n="300" facs="0332" xml:id="pg_300"/>key message that Zaire’s own
                            resources are being used to address essential needs.</p>
                        <p>Beyond the economic reforms you have laid out, I see particular
                            significance in the political reforms you announced in your July 1
                                speech.<note n="8" xml:id="d112fn8">In telegram 6192 from Kinshasa,
                                July 1, 1977, the Embassy summarized the main points of <persName
                                    corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>’s July 1, 1977, speech, in
                                which he proclaimed that Zaire’s “political structure and economy
                                had to be democratized and decentralized.” (National Archives, RG
                                59, Central Foreign Policy File, D770235–0981)</note> As I
                            understand it you envisaged the use of the office of the Prime Minister
                            more fully to handle the day-to-day business of the government and to
                            revitalize the functions of the legislative assembly. I consider this
                            concept of decentralization critical not only to the functioning of your
                            constitutional institutions, but also to the effort of national
                            reconciliation which I know you are undertaking.</p>
                        <p>When the five met in Paris we reviewed the short term requirements of
                            security in Shaba and, as you know, discussed the needs of the African
                            force which is being put in place there. But we all agreed that the
                            African force is only a temporary solution and that the fundamental
                            problems of stability in that region had to be addressed:</p>
                        <p>—The reintegration of Shaba into the body politic of Zaire;</p>
                        <p>—An improvement in relations between Zaire and Angola, which would lead
                            Angola to cooperate in preventing the further incursions of Katangans
                            into Zaire;</p>
                        <p>—Restructuring the <gloss target="#t_FAZ_1">FAZ</gloss> into a leaner,
                            more disciplined force which would have the trust and support of the
                            population.</p>
                        <p>Again, I know that you have ideas on how these critical problems can be
                            approached and I would greatly appreciate hearing from you in this
                            regard. In Paris, our analysis pointed to some specific actions, but we
                            were all agreed that only you could undertake the dramatic gestures and
                            detailed diplomacy that will be necessary.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, Mr. President, I must raise the most delicate of issues. As you
                            know, the furtherance of human rights has become an integral part of
                            American foreign policy.</p>
                        <p>There is no intention on our part of imposing our view on others, but it
                            is also clear that a pattern of human rights violations in a given
                            country inevitably has its repercussions on the overall relationship in
                            general and on assistance programs in particular.</p>
                        <p>I realize full well the enormous challenge that bringing unity to the
                            nation of Zaire presents and I know that American norms cannot be
                            transplanted. At the same time, you must know that I cannot continue
                            significant assistance if corrupt elements continue to be associated in
                            the public mind with your government. Our Ambassador will be pre<pb

                            allegations with you if you desire. Also, support will be most difficult
                            if the pattern of arrests and executions we have witnessed
                            continues.</p>
                        <p>This letter is being sent in a spirit of friendship and frankness. We
                            wish to see Zaire develop into a strong and unified nation. We feel that
                            this can be done only if the hard facts of the current situation are
                            faced courageously and those decisions made which will insure the
                            success of our common effort. Sincerely, <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"

                            were complex, and Sudan considered them just as important as Middle
                            Eastern ones. He said he would like to comment <pb n="305" facs="0337"

                            declared. This is why the Ethiopian people reacted the way they did. He
                            recalled that shortly after changes came in Ethiopia he had visited
                            President Ford and had urged continuation of American military and
                            economic assistance for Ethiopia.<note n="3" xml:id="d115fn3">See <ref

                            was puzzled about what happened after that, he said, for the United
                            States did not give help and left the Ethiopians no alternative but to
                            accept Soviet help. The Soviets rushed in and things have gone from bad
                            to worse, with the Soviets now moving into the area of political
                            organization. Errors on the part of Somalia also contributed to this
                            situation, he said. Ethnic problems in Ethiopia took most serious form
                            in Eritrea because Eritrea had had a separate colonial existence. For
                            Sudan Eritrea is a very important problem, President <persName
                                corresp="#p_NG_1">Nimeiry</persName> said, because it affects Sudan
                            directly, with half a million Eritrean and Ethiopian refugees there. The
                                <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> Summit meeting in Khartoum
                            recognized this problem, he said, and tried to find a way of trying to
                            settle it, with Sierra Leone taking the lead in mediation efforts.<note

                                summit took place in Khartoum July 18–21. The Embassy reported on
                                the Ethiopia/Sudan Mediation Commission, chaired by Sierra Leone, in
                                telegram 3335 from Khartoum, July 24. (National Archives, RG 59,

                        <p>As long as the Soviet Union and Cuba are involved in Ethiopia, <hi
                                rend="italic">President <persName corresp="#p_NG_1"
                                    >Nimeiry</persName></hi> said, he feared the Eritrean problem
                            could not be settled, for he was convinced the Soviets wished to exploit
                            it to consolidate their position in Ethiopia. The Somalis were
                            continuing to support the guerrilla movement in the Ogaden and Sudan
                            fears that this may bring about another outbreak of war. This would also
                            help Soviet and Cuban interests. “What exactly are Soviet and Cuban
                            intentions?” he asked—“I cannot be sure about them but I believe that
                            their objective is still to expand their influence and to bring Marxist
                            ideology to all of Africa. The Soviet Union, using Cuba as an
                            instrument, is very active in Africa and claims to be opposing
                            imperialism or reactionary systems. A central factor is the speed with
                            which the Soviet Union responds to the needs of Africans so that some of
                            the smaller and weaker countries find it very attractive to turn to the
                            Soviet Union for help, knowing that they will get it quickly—the Soviets
                            pour in weaponry. They take advantage of the poverty of people in these
                            countries and their lack <pb n="306" facs="0338" xml:id="pg_306"/>of
                            knowledge of the real intention of the Soviets. We have tried to find
                            alternative solutions for some of these countries.”</p>
                        <p>Returning specifically to Ethiopia, <hi rend="italic">President <persName
                                    corresp="#p_NG_1">Nimeiry</persName></hi> said Sudan had tried
                            to find a basis for settlement in Eritrea and also a basis for
                            settlement between Ethiopia and Somalia. He was convinced that these
                            efforts would have had some success had it not been for the fact that
                            the Soviet Union moved with such speed to undermine them. <hi

                                    >Carter</persName></hi> said we had evidence of strain between
                            the Soviets and <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName> and
                            reports that <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName> had asked
                            the Cubans to reduce their forces; he added that we knew <persName
                                corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName> had made overtures to the
                            Egyptians for better relations. “What are the chances for better

                                corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> asked.</p>
                        <p>“We believe we could move very fast in improving our relations with
                            Ethiopia but only on condition that the parties commit themselves to a

                                    <persName corresp="#p_NG_1">Nimeiry</persName></hi> replied. “It
                            may be that next month I will have a meeting with <persName
                                corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName> in Dar es Salaam. I intend to
                            confront him very frankly with some of the problems that we see
                            confronting Ethiopia and to suggest what could be done to bring Ethiopia
                            back to a better position. But I am afraid that Ethiopia under the
                            leadership of <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName> seems to
                            resort too rapidly to extreme Marxist approaches—this may well indicate
                            that Ethiopia is going to be a second Cuba and merely an instrument of

                            Sudan needs military support to confront threats from outside because it
                            is a large country located in a crossroads position and it is affected

                            source of strength, he said, was its internal strength. Changes which
                            have been brought about have made the country stronger, he

                        <p>It can be argued that, having airlifted the peacekeeping force into

                            never assumed such a commitment. When President <persName

                            of lifting the Europeans out and bringing African replacements in—not as
                            a contribution to an indefinite maintaining of order in Zaire.</p>
                        <p>In response to a State request, <gloss target="#t_JCS_1">JCS</gloss> is
                            now costing out both the airlift rotation of Moroccan/Senegalese forces

                            likely to be as much or more than for the original lift. While a US
                            airlift with C–141s would be more efficient than our allies’ use of
                            Moroccan or Zairian <gloss target="#t_C130_1">C–130s</gloss>, there is
                            no outsize equipment requiring US planes. Costs could be reduced if
                            troops were flown out by commercial carriers and materiel were airlifted
                            to Kinshasa and then shipped to Dakar and Casbalanca.</p>

                            for him personally during his recent “bad days”.<note n="2"

                                1978, the Embassy reported that <persName corresp="#p_NK_1"
                                    >Nguza</persName> had been released from prison on July 14,
                                1978. (National Archives, RG 59, Central Foreign Policy File,
                                D780290–1108)</note> The Secretary responded that he was overjoyed
                            to see Commissioner <persName corresp="#p_NK_1">Nguza</persName>
                            restored to his present position.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NK_1">Nguza</persName> said that he had already
                            spent three days in Washington, most of it on Capitol Hill, where the
                            subject matter had been only about one-third Zaire and two-thirds
                            Rhodesia. Concerning Zaire, however, he had found a good deal of
                            sympathy, even among those most critical of Zaire and President
                                <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>, e.g., Mr.
                            Solarz.</p>
                        <p>In response to the Secretary’s question as to the situation on the Senate
                            side, <persName corresp="#p_NK_1">Nguza</persName> said that he had met
                            with Senators Church, Javits and McGovern, all of whom had taken a
                            positive view. Javits had told <persName corresp="#p_NK_1"
                                >Nguza</persName> that, although he was a Republican, he would
                            support the administration view on Zaire. Senator McGovern had been very
                            helpful and Senator Church, accompanied by several staff members, had
                            posed many questions and promised to be helpful vis-a-vis the House. The
                            Secretary said that he would personally speak with Congressman Solarz on
                            the issue of aid to Zaire.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked Commissioner <persName corresp="#p_NK_1"
                                >Nguza</persName> for a report on the Zairian action program for
                            internal and economic reforms.</p>

                                >Nguza</persName> responded that President <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> has done a great deal in
                            meeting the requirements of Zaire’s international partners. He ticked
                            off, among other accomplishments, the successful amnesty decree which
                            had resulted in the return of 150,000 Zairians from Angola, the
                            reconciliation with Angola, and progress on the internal problems of
                            Zaire. <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> had asked
                                <persName corresp="#p_NK_1">Nguza</persName> to explain to all
                            Zairian dissidents located outside Zaire that they should and could
                            return to Zaire to work for the good of the country without fear of the
                            central regime. Referring to the decentralization of power, the
                            President had created the office of Prime Minister and was giving the
                            incumbent, Bo-Boliko, a good deal of authority and discretion in the use
                            of his power. Bo-Boliko has been given sufficient independence to make
                            important decisions, in consultation with his cabinet colleagues. The
                            National Assembly has been freely elected, granting that it was within
                            the context of a one party system. Even so the Zairian people had in
                            many instances their choice of up to ten candidates for each post to
                            represent them in Kinshasa. Another hopeful development was the new
                            process of interpellation of department heads in the legislature.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked to what extent the Shabans are being reintegrated in
                            the political life of the country.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NK_1">Nguza</persName>, in response, pointed out
                            the thousands of returnees to Shaba from Angola. Moreover, Shaba is
                            represented in the Political Bureau by a number of members, including
                            himself. <persName corresp="#p_NK_1">Nguza</persName> is a member of the
                            National Security Council. Counting himself, there are a total of three
                            Shabans having ministerial portfolios and there is one regional
                            commissioner (Governor) from Shaba.</p>
                        <p>In response to the Secretary’s question as to the progress on
                            reorganization of the army, <persName corresp="#p_NK_1">Nguza</persName>
                            said that criticism against the army had been at two levels. The first
                            had pertained to the regrettable acts committed by the soldiers, acts
                            which, however, were more understandable when one recognizes that they
                            frequently had not been paid for periods running to three or four
                            months. The solution to this problem had been to create an independent
                            office within the Ministry of Finance which would be responsible for
                            regular pay to the soldiers.</p>
                        <p>The second and larger problem was the creation of a “new army” with more
                            training and more discipline. The <gloss target="#t_FAZ_1">FAZ</gloss>
                            needs officers and non-commissioned officers who care about their
                            profession and who will not confuse their own private interests with
                            those of the country. It was in this context that the government of
                            Zaire had requested and received assistance from Belgium and France in
                            the training of 3,000 new soldiers each. Additionally, Zaire has asked
                            the Chinese to train up to 3,000 commandos.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked how long it would take to complete the training
                            process. <persName corresp="#p_NK_1">Nguza</persName> felt that by the
                            end of September sufficient troops <pb n="312" facs="0344"
                                xml:id="pg_312"/>would be trained to complete replacement of the
                            Inter-African Forces. The Belgians would move their training operations
                            to Kamina Base in Shaba and the French would be physically present in
                            Kolwezi and elsewhere in Shaba. The replacement of the <gloss
                                target="#t_IAF_1">IAF</gloss> would begin about the end of June,
                            continuing through the end of September. At about mid-point, perhaps at
                            the end of August, the French would join the Zairians in joint maneuvers
                            in Shaba for psychological reasons, to reassure the expatriate community
                            that it was safe to remain or return.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary noted that we had carefully followed the repatriation of
                            Shabans from Angola and were encouraged. This had led to greater
                            stability along the border with Angola and reinforced the
                            congratulations which had been given to President <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> on his reconciliation with that
                            country.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NK_1">Nguza</persName> noted that Zaire had been
                            talking to King Hassan about the withdrawal of the Moroccans and other
                            components of the <gloss target="#t_IAF_1">IAF</gloss>, hopefully with
                            United States assistance.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary responded that we will help. We are still considering
                            problems of finance and legal constraints but we are working out the
                            necessary ways to resolve these problems.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRM_1">Moose</persName> noted that we are
                            consulting with the French and Belgians about some kind of joint effort
                            in the replacement process.</p>
                        <p>Commissioner <persName corresp="#p_NK_1">Nguza</persName> referred to the
                            economic situation in Zaire which he characterized as being “terrible
                            and dangerous”. He said that without substantial assistance from Zaire’s
                            friends Zaire will never reach “take off”. The <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> Plan had as a fundamental
                            objective the fight against corruption in Zaire. It looked to reinforce
                            the management of the financial institutions in Zaire such as the
                            Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance. In public enterprises it
                            looked to the reduction of managerial abuses. A fundamental component of
                            the <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> Plan is the presence
                            in Zaire of outside experts such as those provided by the International
                            Monetary Fund.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked what plans were being made to retain the services of
                            the <gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss>’s Erwin Blumenthal. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NK_1">Nguza</persName> responded that Zaire has asked
                            the <gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss> to keep Blumenthal as long as
                            he might be needed.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said it was clear that a key problem for Zaire is regaining
                            the confidence of lenders and donors. To this end it was extremely
                            important to conclude the agreement with the <gloss target="#t_IMF_1"
                                >IMF</gloss> and then to work out the problem of the debt
                            renegotiations.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NK_1">Nguza</persName> said that the government of
                            Zaire was in full agreement. The problem with the <gloss
                                target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss> had become more difficult, however,
                            since the government of Zaire had found it necessary to increase
                            salaries in the public sector following on the steep prices resulting
                            from three currency devaluations. The skyrocketing prices had created
                            severe social and political problems for the government of Zaire.</p>
                        <p><pb n="313" facs="0345" xml:id="pg_313"/>The Secretary responded that he
                            was familiar with the problem having seen it in other countries. He
                            added that he wished to be helpful in getting the (<gloss

                        <p>The Secretary said he was following with considerable interest the
                            problem of barter deals in Zaire. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRM_1"
                                >Moose</persName> commented that he and the Commissioner had covered
                            the barter deal problem in great detail in the morning meeting. It was
                            possible to sympathize with the occasional, one-time, barter deal to
                            cope with a specific difficult situation. However, it is necessary
                            whenever possible to avoid them since they tend to syphon off foreign
                            exchange which would otherwise be available to meet priority needs in
                            the developmental and social needs of the country.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary told Commissioner <persName corresp="#p_NK_1"
                                >Nguza</persName> that the United States government was appreciative
                            of Zairian support for the Egypt/Israel treaty and added that he was
                            worried about the possible outcome of the Islamic conference. It looked
                            as though Egypt might be suspended from the conference.<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d117fn3">In telegram 3164 from Rabat, May 9, the Embassy
                                reported that the Islamic Foreign Ministers’ Conference had voted to
                                suspend Egypt’s membership in the Islamic Conference and associated
                                bodies. (National Archives, RG 59, Central Foreign Policy File,

                            country such as Egypt for entering into an agreement which would enable
                            it to get back its own lands and which would for the first time deal
                            with the Palestinian problem.</p>

                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> stated that the
                            U.S. views Zaire as important, both from the bilateral relations point
                            of view and from the strategic point of view. He noted that it was in a
                            strategic position and wielded important power and influence in African
                            affairs. He went on to speak <pb n="315" facs="0347" xml:id="pg_315"
                            />encouragingly of the reforms which Zaire had instituted, and expressed
                            the hope that this would be a continuing process. (S)</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NK_1">Nguza</persName> responded affirmatively and
                            said that he had been questioned extensively and intensively about
                            reforms, and that at one point he had been asked for “proof” of
                                <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>’s commitment to
                            reform. <persName corresp="#p_NK_1">Nguza</persName> said he simply
                            replied, “the proof is me.” (S)</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> pointed out our
                            concerns about obtaining a just and viable settlement in Southern
                            Africa, particularly Rhodesia, which would forestall further outside
                            intervention, prevent complete polarization of the races, and promote
                            stability in the area. He noted that Zaire had an important role to play
                            in this process. (S)</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NK_1">Nguza</persName> agreed, and said that
                            President <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> would be taking
                            further initiatives in order to help bring about a political settlement.

                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> noted this with
                            satisfaction, and said that he felt the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1"
                                >OAU</gloss> should take a stronger position to assure a larger role

                            responding to an earlier question, noted that he hoped that the

                            would one day be able to get together to talk personally at some

                        <p>The Paris section of the London-based human rights organization said the

                            April 18 and taken to the central Ngarangba prison to be punished. The

                            Nzakara and arrested several hundred children. “Some of the children
                            were stoned by the imperial guards to punish them for having thrown
                            stones at the imperial car,” Amnesty said. “Others were stabbed with
                            bayonets, others died from blows by clubs containing nails. Probably
                            nearly 100 children were killed and buried in a common grave during the
                            night by the guards,” the report said. The organization said the
                            students were locked in small cells sealed so tightly that about 20 of
                            the children suffocated. Amnesty said one witness alone counted 62
                            bodies. The next day, the 58-year-old <persName corresp="#p_BJ_2"

                        <p>A. We have received reports from Bangui that a number of young persons
                            were rounded up and imprisoned in mid-April. The reports included
                            allegations that, while the bulk of the students and other young persons
                            had been released, some of them might have been killed while in custody.
                            The rumors in Bangui ranged from roughly seven dead to about forty.
                            However, we have had no independent confirmation of these stories, or
                            indeed whether any deaths actually occurred. However, if true, we would
                            greatly regret the reoccurence of government violence directed at the
                            student population along the lines of comparable events reported in
                            Bangui in January.<note n="2" xml:id="d119fn2">In telegram 132 from

                                corresp="#p_DFM_1">Deng</persName> of yesterday’s Senate action
                            increasing Sudan’s proposed FY 1980 appropriations to $25M in <gloss
                                target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> credits and $50M in security
                            supporting assistance. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_DFM_1">Deng</persName>
                            responded that he was aware of the Senate’s good news and amazed to see
                            how quickly the word had spread throughout Washington. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DFM_1">Deng</persName> then launched into a lengthy
                            discussion on Sudan’s position in the region vis-a-vis its neighbors,
                            explaining that the principles which Sudan supports and which had won it
                            friends in the past are now endangering Sudan’s achievements. This was
                            evidenced by the hostile actions of Iraq which cut Sudan’s oil supply
                            without warning at a very critical time. Because of the instability in
                            Sudan created by the radical Arabs, a debate within the country has
                            ensued as to whether or not the government’s continued support of
                            President Sadat and the Peace Treaty is wise. The radical Arabs have
                            undertaken subversive actions to discredit President Nimeiri’s position
                            with his countrymen, and to further arouse public discontent.
                            Rejectionist Arabs are providing both money and arms for this
                            purpose.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_DFM_1">Deng</persName> continued that the

                                >Mengistu</persName>’s refusal to resolve the Eritrean dispute
                            during the Freetown talks is also destabilizing to Sudan’s security. At

                            which Dr. <persName corresp="#p_DFM_1">Deng</persName> was asked to

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCW_1">Duncan</persName> stated that he
                            was pleased with the marked improvement in the level of US assistance
                            for Sudan. He believed that through their visits Sudanese officials such
                            as Dr. <persName corresp="#p_DFM_1">Deng</persName> had presented
                            Washington officials with a clearer picture of Sudan’s needs, thus
                            enabling us to be more responsive to Sudan’s requests for aid. Secretary

                            proposal for a National Communications Network for Sudan which both
                            President Nimeiri and <gloss target="#t_LTG_1">LTG</gloss> Magid had
                            raised during previous meetings with him. (Dr. <persName

                            explained that Collins Division of Rockwell International was now
                            actively pursuing the project. Collins expects the project would cost
                            between $5M–$7M, and that the Collins representative in Cairo would be
                            visiting Khartoum within the next week to discuss the proposal with
                            Sudanese government officials. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCW_1"
                                >Duncan</persName> asked Dr. <persName corresp="#p_DFM_1"
                                >Deng</persName> to tell President Nimeiri that we understood the

                            news on the Communications System. He then mentioned that one important
                            issue he was asked to discuss was Sudan’s need for general military
                            planning over the next five years based on the survey report which we

                            understanding in our government of Sudan’s needs. For example, at a time
                            when Congress is enforcing reductions in general, the Senate instead has
                            added to Sudan’s FY 1980 allocations. He was pleased that things are
                            moving in the right direction.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_DFM_1">Deng</persName> then confidentially
                            mentioned that he wished to explain President Nimeiri’s efforts in
                            southern Africa. He believes that if African leadership approaches
                            Rhodesia realistically, they would see that the new government has
                            potential. The new leaders in Rhodesia-Zimbabwe have also struggled to
                            get where they are. It is too simplistic to expect each party to be
                            happy with the outcome of the elections. President Nimeiri believes in
                            the broader concept of representation and for this reason he is
                            continuing to negotiate with Patriotic Front leaders. Nkomo in fact has
                            asked to meet with Nimeiri.</p>
                        <p>On Uganda, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_DFM_1">Deng</persName> explained
                            that the Sudan is apprehensive about the way <persName
                                corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName> met his downfall since it was a
                            violation of territorial boundaries. As head of the <gloss
                                target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>, and because some Sudanese were
                            involved in Uganda, Sudan has withheld recognition of the new
                            government. They do intend to be supportive of the new government,
                            however, in order to help bring stability to the country.<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d120fn4">After <persName corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName>
                                fled Uganda into exile in Libya on April 11, a provisional Ugandan
                                government was formed. See <ref target="#d162">Documents

                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_DFM_1">Deng</persName> briefly mentioned the
                            Foreign Minister’s recent visit to Libya and the embarrassment it had
                            created for his government. He explained that they were trying to
                            correct some of the erroneous statements made on Sudanese policy during
                            the visit.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_DFM_1">Deng</persName> said he would be
                            returning to Sudan from his visit reassured of US support. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DCW_1">Duncan</persName> suggested to Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DFM_1">Deng</persName> that if the Sudanese
                            felt an increase in US presence through ship visits or deployments such
                            as the earlier F–15 visit, would help to deter Sudan’s adversaries, then
                            we would be willing to provide such a signal. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DFM_1">Deng</persName> thanked Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCW_1">Duncan</persName> for the offer. He went on to
                            say that two other ways which he believed we might demonstrate close
                            US/Sudanese defense cooperation and thus deter aggression would be by
                            airlifting some military items which we plan to expedite to Sudan, and
                            by sending a team to Sudan to discuss Sudanese defense planning.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCW_1">Duncan</persName> said he would
                            look into these possibilities.</p>

                            <salute>Dear Mr. President:</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>I want to take the opportunity provided by your kind letter of April
                                28<note n="2" xml:id="d121fn2">See <ref target="#d118fn3">footnote

                                    <ref target="#d118">118</ref>.</note> to review with you key
                            elements of the relations between our two countries. I last wrote you on
                            June 11, 1978.<note n="4" xml:id="d121fn4">See <ref target="#d112"
                                    >Document 112</ref>.</note> Since then, much has occurred and
                            important tasks have begun.</p>
                        <p>The sustained momentum of the economic and other reforms you have set in
                            motion continues to be an important factor in our relations. As we
                            explained to Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_NK_1"
                                >Nguza</persName>, the conclusion of the pending stabilization
                            agreement with the International Monetary Fund will mark a major
                            milestone in your efforts to revitalize the Zairian economy. Once this
                            agreement is in place, we should be able to proceed rapidly with
                            implementation of a new agricultural commodity program and with
                            disbursements on the Inga-Shaba transmission line cost overrun loan.</p>
                        <p>Equally important is continued progress on the full range of other
                            reforms which you have set in motion, including those expanding
                            political and civil liberties. In this regard, I welcome your recent
                            decision to reshape your cabinet as a commitment on your part to place
                            increasing responsibility in the First Commissioner and his colleagues
                            for carrying out reform programs in all sectors of national life.</p>
                        <p>We both recognize, however, that there is still far to go in achieving
                            all that you have established as Zaire’s primary objectives. In
                            particular, we are convinced that the Zairian armed forces must earn the
                            trust and support of the people in all regions of Zaire if they are to
                            carry out their mission of preserving national security. The pace of
                            military reform will assume larger importance as Zairian troops begin to
                            replace the African forces in Shaba. We want to help in this process
                            and, as we informed your Foreign Minister, we are prepared to
                            participate in a combined effort to withdraw the African forces from
                            Shaba according to the timetable you have established.</p>
                        <p>We want to continue to support you as you pursue the rigorous program you
                            have articulated as the sound basis for reform and <pb n="322"
                                facs="0354" xml:id="pg_322"/>national renewal. As a means of
                            cooperating on this important program you have undertaken, our staffs
                            should remain in close and frank dialogue on all aspects of the program
                            implementation, and perhaps at some appropriate point it could be useful
                            and productive for us to get together for a talk under circumstances
                            mutually convenient.</p>

                            <p>2) We appreciated in this regard the constructive role played by

                            <p>3) We were further gratified by Gabon’s efforts to keep the

                                obvious efforts to swing it toward Moscow.</p>

                                that President <persName corresp="#p_BO_1">Bongo</persName>, while

                                the importance of holding to principle on Rhodesia. Some Americans
                                saw a black bishop with the title of prime minister and wanted to
                                lift sanctions precipitously. The President felt we must persevere
                                to seek a government in Zimbabwe truly reflecting majority rule.
                                President <persName corresp="#p_BO_1">Bongo</persName> could help us

                            comprehensive peace was desirable, but we had to start somewhere. Egypt
                            and Sadat were now seriously isolated. Gabon and other friendly African
                            governments were trying to rally African support for him. Africans had
                            broken with Israel at Egypt’s request, and it now appeared logical for
                            Africa to renew contact with Israel. President <persName

                            to the U.K. to make the first move. At such time as Britain declared
                            Rhodesia independent, others could consider their own position. Action
                            now would be untimely and wrong. The citizens <pb n="327" facs="0359"

                            However, the Patriotic Front had refused to cooperate in an early
                            election and <persName corresp="#p_SRP_1">Ian Smith</persName> had gone
                            ahead without them. Others must view the resulting situation with

                            with the Vice President. In order to oppose Cuban influence, the United

                            countries such as Angola where the Soviets and Cubans were not truly

                            communists were not popular in Congo-Brazzaville either. Africans were
                            like people everywhere and wanted to eat and to live more comfortably.
                            You could not eat ideology. Furthermore, maintenance of Cuban armies and
                            technicians was a very expensive matter for African governments; this

                            at his initiative this morning, June 22, in Berengo. In a rambling and

                                target="#t_CAE_1">CAE</gloss>. He said he wished cordial relations
                            with the US and that events here had been exaggerated by the press. I
                            told <persName corresp="#p_BJ_2">Bokassa</persName> that Washington
                            authorities and US public had been shocked by Amnesty International

                            but atmosphere in Washington was such that further bilateral assistance
                            programs appeared impossible at this time. <persName corresp="#p_BJ_2"
                                >Bokassa</persName> took this calmly, said he had facilitated
                            commission’s inquiries and urged me to work for improved US–<gloss
                                target="#t_CAE_1">CAE</gloss> relations. End summary.</p>
                        <p>3. This was an odd visit. Charge Fairchild had been convoked before
                                <gloss target="#t_GOCAE_1">GOCAE</gloss> learned of my return, and
                            the invitation was then changed. <persName corresp="#p_BJ_2"
                                >Bokassa</persName>, accompanied by <gloss target="#t_PriMin_1"
                                >PriMin</gloss> Maidou and Deputy <gloss target="#t_FonMin_1"
                                >FonMin</gloss> Lavodrama, received me cordially, but appeared
                            somewhat muddled and had probably been drinking. He started by saying
                            that the Russians were at the bottom of <gloss target="#t_CAE_1"
                                >CAE</gloss>’s problems. Russian teachers had subverted <gloss
                                target="#t_CAE_1">CAE</gloss> youth, and France had been unwilling
                            to supply adequate assistance to replace the Soviets. He was strongly
                            anti-Communist and wanted to remain close to the US and Western Europe.
                            He regretted the defections of <gloss target="#t_CAE_1">CAE</gloss>
                            Ambassador to France Sylvestre Bangui, who was a fellow M’Baka
                            tribesman, and former <gloss target="#t_PriMin_1">PriMin</gloss>
                            Patasse, who had arranged his coronation. He welcomed democratic
                            opposition (sic) but could not accept violence. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BJ_2">Bokassa</persName> said he had the people with
                            him. If not he would leave the country. At this point he reversed
                            himself and said “no, I will not leave the country. I was born here and
                            I will die here.” Further, he said he had no money whatsoever abroad (a
                            patent falsehood which I did not contradict), and lived on the income
                                <pb n="329" facs="0361" xml:id="pg_329"/>from his Berengo farm. He
                            said he might resign, and compared his plight to that of President Nixon
                            after Watergate. “But Nixon lives quietly. Africa is barbaric. If the
                            Chief of State resigns they kill him”. <persName corresp="#p_BJ_2"
                                >Bokassa</persName> mentioned Ghana’s Acheampong as an example.<note

                        <p>4. I said the US had endeavored to maintain close relations with <gloss
                                target="#t_CAE_1">CAE</gloss>. But the AI allegations of events in
                            April, following the suppression of the January riots, had caused a
                            sensation in the US. Congress had voted against further bilateral aid,
                            and though the decision was not final I saw no likelihood of reversing
                            it. <persName corresp="#p_BJ_2">Bokassa</persName> simply nodded. I
                            noted that the report of the five-nation commission would be read with
                            great interest in Washington. <persName corresp="#p_BJ_2"
                                >Bokassa</persName> said he hoped the report would clear the air.
                            There were too many lies—he mentioned the press reports of an
                            assassination attempt in April, and added, almost as an afterthought “I
                            didn’t kill the children”. Finally, he urged me to work to improve
                            relations, and appeared gratified at my assurances.</p>
                        <p>5. Comment: <persName corresp="#p_BJ_2">Bokassa</persName>’s mood was
                            melancholic, and his attempts to appear cheerful unsuccessful. He is a
                            consummate actor with real powers of dissimulation, but he left the
                            impression of being distraught and uncertain, unable to find a way out
                            of an increasingly untenable position. His motivation for initiating
                            this discussion was perhaps an attempt to shore up relations with the US
                            by stressing his anti-Communist sentiments, but he was singularly
                            unconvincing. I plan to proceed with demarche to <gloss

                            young nation that reached independence under difficult circumstances and
                            his main task had been to create a nation and conditions of peace, at

                            then addressed himself to a series of criticisms that had been laid to
                            Zaire, explaining in some detail how Zaire was making important progress
                            in the fields of democratization under the new constitution including
                            rights of women and said that the support that he had gotten in his
                            reelection, without even having to campaign, showed the strength of the

                            that there are no political prisoners in Zaire and that the prison

                            from the Belgians. Further, <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"

                            that of Belgium and France. He expressed great optimism about the
                            economic future of Zaire under changed conditions and believed that
                            matters are going forward well despite inevitable problems. Zaire

                        <p>The Secretary said he wished to pick up the thread from the preceding
                            conversation. He wondered what the security situation was on the Zairian
                            border with Angola and what effect the succession in Luanda would have
                            on that situation.<note n="2" xml:id="d127fn2">Angolan President
                                    <persName corresp="#p_NAA_1">Neto</persName> died on September
                                10.</note> Were there currently any problems concerning resurgency
                            of the Katangan Gendarmes?</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> said that all
                            depends upon who will be <persName corresp="#p_NAA_1">Neto</persName>’s
                            successor. On the one hand there is Pascoal Luvualu who is well and
                            favorably known to Zaire and who would be an acceptable successor from
                            the GOZ viewpoint. The second candidate, however, is Lucio Lara whom
                            President <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> considers to be
                            dangerous, a man of the left, and in tight relationship with the Cubans
                            and the Soviets. In regard to the gendarmes, <persName
                                corresp="#p_NAA_1">Neto</persName> had kept his promises; the
                            gendarmes remaining in Angola are no problem. However, “most” of the
                            gendarmes have fled to Zambia, posing a small problem there. President
                            Kaunda presumably would not voluntarily let them act against Zaire but,
                            given the difficulty of Zambia in controlling that part of its
                            territory, <pb n="335" facs="0367" xml:id="pg_335"/>something could
                            happen. Zaire, however, is not greatly concerned because the conditions
                            for such aggression are not favorable; things have evolved for the
                            better in Shaba in the recent past.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, said <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>, he had
                            received agreement that the French, the Belgians and the Chinese
                            military trainers will stay on for two more years in a training capacity
                            to assure that the new Zairian armed forces would be well trained and
                            well officered. The French and Belgians are now integrated in command
                            roles with the newly deployed forces in Shaba. They are working closely
                            with their Zairian counterparts, who should be well-trained at the end
                            of the period.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he wished to make a few general comments concerning
                            Zaire. We all recognize that much remains to be done in Zaire but we
                            have also noted the points of progress in the recent past. These include
                            the new agreement with the <gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss>,<note

                            months will be very difficult for Zaire. It will take real determination
                            for President <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> and his
                            colleagues to stay within the <gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss>
                            guidelines and to persist with the important question of military
                            reform. The Secretary congratulated President <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> on the relationship which he
                            had worked out with President <persName corresp="#p_NAA_1"
                                >Neto</persName> of Angola. He hoped President <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> would be able to work with
                                <persName corresp="#p_NAA_1">Neto</persName>’s successor in a
                            constructive fashion to help maintain peace in the area. The Secretary
                            added that he was impressed by the evolving roles of the Prime Minister
                            and the Parliament in Zaire, a point which President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> himself had mentioned in the
                            earlier meeting. The Secretary felt it was important that the Prime

                            in those offices. He then asked how President <persName

                            economic and financial situation in Zaire in the months ahead.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> said that the
                            success of the <gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss> plan would depend,
                            not only on Zairian determination, but also in large part on assistance
                            from Zaire’s partners. This had been a point discussed at the meeting in
                            Brussels in November of last year when it had been agreed that,
                            following emplacement of a satisfactory stabilization plan in Zaire, the
                            various partners would proceed with their assistance programs.<note

                            the program closely.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that we look forward to working with the Foreign

                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_NK_1">Nguza</persName>, we have found
                            that any problems between us have been settled rapidly and satisfactory
                            with his good help.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> said that it was
                            important for him and his colleagues to know that the Americans are
                            supportive of Zaire.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary responded that, given the long ties between our two

                            could count on the US to help the execution of his reform programs.</p>

                                >Mobutu</persName> that in the very near future we will be asking
                            agrément for a very good American Ambassador to Kinshasa, a
                            distinguished foreign service officer, a man whom the Secretary knows
                            well having worked with him for the past three years.<note n="5"

                        <p>Turning to the broader issues of southern Africa, Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_VC_1">Vance</persName> asked President <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>’s views on the current
                            conference in London on Zimbabwe/Rhodesia, and on the Namibian
                            question.</p>
                        <p>Concerning Zimbabwe/Rhodesia President <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> said that the major important fact is that all of
                            the parties have come together in London. He, <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>, had personally always held the
                            view that a settlement could come only by such a conference. He had
                            pressed this on his African friends and at the recent <gloss
                                target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> Summit Meeting. He, <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>, felt that there is no escaping
                            the fact that this is their problem which can be worked out only
                            together. The important thing is that they should continue to talk to
                            each other.</p>
                        <p>On Namibia, <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> said neither
                                <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss> nor the SAG are playing by
                            the rules. South Africa would likely accept an independent Namibia only
                            reluctantly. The South Africans were concerned that a Namibian
                            independence would result in a communist government installed on their
                            border. On the other side, <persName corresp="#p_NAA_1">Neto</persName>
                            had told <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> of his tough
                            problems with <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss> since, according
                            to <persName corresp="#p_NAA_1">Neto</persName>, <gloss
                                target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss> President <persName
                                corresp="#p_NSD_1">Nujoma</persName> was afraid to participate in
                            elections he thought he might lose.</p>
                        <p>Returning to Rhodesia the Secretary said that we are fully supportive of
                            Great Britain in arriving at a peaceful settlement. There was a <pb
                                n="337" facs="0369" xml:id="pg_337"/>good chance of drafting a
                            satisfactory new constitution. New elections under such constitution
                            would, of course, be desirable but they would be more difficult,
                            perhaps, to arrive at than the first step of agreeing on
                            constitution.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> noted that he
                            had been active in working with leaders such as Kaunda, <persName
                                corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nyerere</persName> and Obansanjo to encourage an
                            all-parties conference. Everyone seemed more or less agreed with his
                            viewpoint. He added that, while he would not wish to criticise his
                            Nigerian colleagues, he felt that their attitudes “did not make the task
                            any easier.” However, <persName corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nyerere</persName> has
                            changed for the better and encouraged President <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> in his efforts.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VC_1">Vance</persName> said that
                                <persName corresp="#p_NAA_1">Neto</persName>’s death might have an
                            unfortunate influence on moving the Namibia problem to a successful
                            conclusion. Were <persName corresp="#p_NAA_1">Neto</persName>’s
                            successor not of the same view as <persName corresp="#p_NAA_1"
                                >Neto</persName>, the chances of a solution might well
                            disappear.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> commented that <persName
                                corresp="#p_NAA_1">Neto</persName>’s death was indeed unfortunate.
                            Turning to another subject <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> said that it was not to him to offer advice to
                            the United States Government but he did wish to suggest that the
                            Secretary should follow the Western Sahara question carefully.
                            Developments there could be dangerous. The Secretary agreed, noting that
                            the situation in the Western Sahara had been both dangerous and fragile
                            during the last two months.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> commented that Algeria
                            alone was no particular problem for Morocco but with other players
                            involved, such as Libyans and the Russians, there was a potential for
                            the question to become very big one.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he wished to return to the subject of US assistance to
                            Zaire, which had been raised only briefly in the cabinet room. He said
                            that the continued progress on reform in Zaire was the key to our
                            ability to maintain current levels of economic and military assistance.
                            We are following closely the progress of the new army units in Shaba; we
                            are pleased that they seem to be making a real effort to enlist the
                            support of the population in Shaba.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> commented that the units
                            were under strict orders. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WL_1"
                                >Walker</persName> had seen them in Zaire during his recent visit
                            and could testify to the state of their discipline.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he wished to raise another problem area, i.e., the
                            lack of agreement so far on rescheduling of the Zairian private and
                            public debt. This was significant because the issue was linked to the
                            question of our ability to provide aid. President <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> immediately intervened to say
                            that we should not raise new conditions to US assistance beyond those
                            agreed to at Brussels.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WL_1">Walker</persName> explained that the
                            linkage lies in our inability to disburse assistance when Zaire is in
                            arrears on its debts. The purpose of <pb n="338" facs="0370"
                                xml:id="pg_338"/>rescheduling of the debt was to eliminate the
                            problem of arrearages. He also mentioned to the Secretary that Lazard
                            Freres is now advising the government of Zaire on the question of
                            rescheduling of the debt in the London and Paris Clubs.<note n="6"
                                xml:id="d127fn6">The London Club is a group of private creditors,
                                while the Paris Club comprises public lenders. See <ref

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWC_1">Harrop</persName> said that President
                                <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> was undoubtedly aware
                            of the very strong criticism to which Zaire had been subjected in the
                            Congress. President <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> would
                            be seeing important Congressional personalities tomorrow and would be
                            able to get a first hand appreciation of their attitudes. This was
                            important because it is to the Congress that we must turn for the
                            resources necessary to continue support of Zaire. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_VC_1">Vance</persName> agreed, saying that this
                            presented a golden opportunity for President <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> to meet directly with and hear
                            the ideas of important Congressmen.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then asked President <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName>’s views on recent events in the Central African
                            Empire and Equatorial Guinea. President <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> responded that he did not know Equatorial Guinea
                            well. He had often been invited to visit by the now ex-President but had
                            kept putting the invitation off.<note n="7" xml:id="d127fn7">See <ref

                            that he had been charged some seven years ago by the <gloss

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>’s view of the situation in
                            the <gloss target="#t_CAE_1">CAE</gloss> was somber. He expressed his
                            concern for the families of the dead students and of the “bad situation”
                            in the interior of the country.<note n="8" xml:id="d127fn8">See <ref

                                >Cutler</persName>’s departure from Kinshasa, he, <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> had been away from Kinshasa.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CWL_1">Cutler</persName> had therefore
                            unfortunately left Zaire without the proper honors due him. President
                                <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> wished the Secretary
                            to know that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CWL_1">Cutler</persName>
                            had done a great deal for Zairian-US relations. He had therefore ordered
                            that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CWL_1">Cutler</persName> be
                            decorated with the national order of Zaire, the Order of the Leopard, at
                            a ceremony in the Zairian Embassy the following morning. He wished the
                            Secretary to know that Charge Davis in Kinshasa is doing a excellent job
                            and was much appreciated in Kinshasa.</p>
                        <p><pb n="339" facs="0371" xml:id="pg_339"/>The Secretary responded that he
                            was pleased to hear these kind words and to be informed of Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_CWL_1">Cutler</persName>’s impending honor.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CWL_1">Cutler</persName> was one of the
                            fine officers of the Foreign Service corps and the Secretary was
                            delighted to see such officers recognized.</p>
                        <p>At this point President <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>
                            laughingly pointed out that, in looking around the room, it might well
                            have been a meeting of his own council of ministers in Kinshasa, with
                            the understandable exception of the Secretary, all present on the
                            American side were familiar with and for the most part had served in
                            Zaire. He had been informed that there was a “Zairian Mafia” in the
                            State Department and he now saw most of the members present. He would
                            have <persName corresp="#p_NK_1">Nguza</persName> invite the Secretary
                            to visit Zaire and, thus, close the circuit.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary expressed his regrets at not being able to attend the
                            dinner given that evening by Governor Harriman for President <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> but that he had not enough
                            time. The problem of the Soviet brigade in Cuba was demanding. The
                            Soviets had stated that the brigade was only a training unit which had
                            been in Cuba for many years. The US had only begun discussions with the
                            Soviets on the issue yesterday and the Secretary assumed that the
                            discussions could continue for days or even weeks. President <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> asked if the eventual outcome
                            would be withdrawal of the brigade. The Secretary said that the first
                            problem was to determine the facts. We had put a number of questions to
                            the Soviets but as yet had received no answers. After having the facts
                            we would determine what the optimal outcome of the problem should
                            be.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> concluded the
                            meeting by saying that he hoped to have the continuing support of the US
                            in his programs. It was the US which was the key to garnering support of
                            other partners.</p>
                        <p>On the way out, <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> showed the
                            Secretary a letter from Senghor in which the Senegalese President stated
                            that he had talked with the head of the Jurists’ Commission which had
                            investigated the atrocities in the <gloss target="#t_CAE_1">CAE</gloss>
                            and was convinced there was no truth to the rumor that Zairian troops
                            had been involved.</p>

                                >Nguza</persName> replied that the visit with Solarz had gone well.
                            Personally he had liked the session, which had been handled in a frank
                            democratic way. <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> had
                            acknowledged that there is much wrong in Zaire but that it was important
                            to assess current efforts to rectify Zaire’s problems. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> had urged Solarz to come and
                            see for himself; Solarz has accepted and is scheduled to arrive at the
                            end of November.<note n="4" xml:id="d128fn4">In telegram 241899 to

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NK_1">Nguza</persName> said the Washington visit
                            had been a success in more ways than one. In Paris, on the return trip,
                            Giscard told <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> that it was
                            “wonderful” that he (<persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>) had
                            been able to meet with the “leader of the western world”. Giscard took
                            this as a “green light” for further French aid to Zaire but had said
                            that Zaire “must” implement the terms of the <gloss target="#t_IMF_1"
                                >IMF</gloss> agreement. Giscard had opined that the <gloss

                            immediately responded “Yes, if”, vocally underlining the “if”.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary went on to say that he wanted to underscore the importance
                            of not letting the debt rescheduling process slip. He was a little
                            worried because slippage could have adverse effects on Brussels

                            importance of rescheduling but also had the political will to follow
                            through. He had instructed that all necessary preparatory work be
                            completed before the end of October to permit getting it to Simonet for
                            dissemination to interested parties.</p>

                            agreement. He, <persName corresp="#p_NK_1">Nguza</persName>, had
                            received “rumors” in New York of unauthorized expenditures, e.g., for
                            Air Zaire, and in Lubumbashi and Gbadolite. <persName corresp="#p_NK_1"
                                >Nguza</persName> had immediately sent a cable to Kinshasa saying
                            that he didn’t know if the rumors were true. If so, however, the
                            expenditures were to stop; if not he wanted a cable report. This action
                            was consistent with <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>’s
                            action on return to Kinshasa when he had ordered that all unnecessary
                            expenditures be stopped, at least through the end of this year. This,
                            illustratively, included a prohibition on all official foreign travel
                            except for <persName corresp="#p_NK_1">Nguza</persName> himself, and

                        <p>The trip had gone well, said <persName corresp="#p_NK_1"

                            Santos rather than Lucio Lara who is a “hardline Leninist”. Dos Santos
                            may be in for some internal problems even though he is believed to be
                            the “political son” of, and “pre-selected” by, <persName

                                <persName corresp="#p_NAA_1">Neto</persName> line. On relations with
                            Zaire, Dos Santos had said “Exactly like <persName corresp="#p_NAA_1"
                                >Neto</persName>”. On Namibia, “Exactly like <persName

                            “Exactly like <persName corresp="#p_NAA_1">Neto</persName>”. Per
                                <persName corresp="#p_NK_1">Nguza</persName>, Dos Santos had added
                            “On the body of my brother <persName corresp="#p_NAA_1"
                            >Neto</persName>”, I will follow his line.”</p>

                            and your government are determined to rebuild Equatorial Guinea and
                            overcome the human rights abuses inflicted by former President Macias.
                            Because the plight of the people of Equatorial Guinea has been a matter
                            for deep concern in this country, we will be watching with sympathy and

                            are prepared to offer emergency assistance, initially in the area of

                            envisage relations as being conducted through frequent visits to Malabo
                            by officials accredited from our Embassy in Yaounde. Once relations are
                            formally reestablished, our two governments can consider more permanent

                        <p>The greater US role in the northwestern Indian Ocean area has made it
                            increasingly important from Washington’s point of view to have a
                            friendly and moderate government in Khartoum. Sudanese President
                            Nimeiri’s support for the Middle East peace process, in the face of
                            pressure from other Arab states, has also given his country a new
                            significance.</p>
                        <p>The most serious challenge to Nimeiri’s regime is economic. Despite
                            international financial action, the economic outlook is bleak. Serious
                            shortages of consumer goods and a declining standard of living could
                            cause outbreaks of popular unrest and dissatisfaction within the
                            security forces—Nimeiri’s main base of support—that could threaten his
                            government. The possibility of a commercial-size oil find, his political
                            skill, and the disunity of the opposition will improve his prospects
                            somewhat.</p>
                        <p>If Nimeiri were deposed, the military presumably would remain in control,
                            although it is possible that a successor regime would be nominally
                            civilian led. In either case, the successor regime would probably
                            identify less with US interests in the area and move some distance
                            toward the Arab consensus, especially with regard to policy toward Egypt
                            and the peace process.<note n="2" xml:id="d132fn2">For the views of the
                                Defense Intelligence Agency on this sentence, see footnote 7 at
                                paragraph 75 of the Discussion section. [Footnote is in the
                                original.]</note> A less likely alternative would be a successor
                            regime controlled by military officers who favored a closer alignment
                            with the hardline Arab states.</p>
                        <p>US ability to influence Sudanese policy depends primarily on how the
                            Sudanese perceive US resolve and strength. Sudan wants a strong friend
                            and military patron to counter threats it sees presented by the <gloss

                        <p><pb n="346" facs="0378" xml:id="pg_346"/>As Nimeiri’s hope for political
                            survival over the short term depends in part on his ability to have
                            bread and flour on store shelves when the traditional lean summer season
                            arrives, probably the most important thing that the United States could
                            do to aid him in the near term would be to increase food aid.</p>

                        <p>[Omitted here is the table of contents.]</p>
                        <p rend="center">PREFACE</p>
                        <p>This Interagency Intelligence Memorandum is limited in scope and
                            addresses four basic questions: is <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName>’s Zaire “reformable”; why has no revolt against
                            the <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> regime taken place;
                            what would be the impact if the United States distanced itself from
                                <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>; and what would be
                            the impact of <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>’s fall from
                            power?</p>
                        <p>Included is an annex on the importance of Zaire’s cobalt to the West.</p>
                        <p>This memorandum was prepared under the auspices of the National
                            Intelligence Officer for Africa with contributions from the State
                            Department’s Bureau of Intelligence and Research, the Central
                            Intelligence Agency, and the Defense Intelligence Agency. It has been
                            coordinated at the working level.</p>
                        <p rend="center">KEY JUDGMENTS</p>
                        <p>Although President <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> of
                            Zaire has taken steps in the political and economic spheres he would not
                            have taken without external pressure, he has done nothing he could not
                            reverse if he became convinced that the costs outweighed the benefits.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> is likely to continue
                            to oppose or circumvent efforts to alter significantly his style of
                            rule. He has moved ahead just enough on reforms, however, to make
                            premature the conclusion that additional progress under his leadership
                            is not possible.</p>
                        <p><pb n="347" facs="0379" xml:id="pg_347"/>Far-reaching reform in the
                            Western sense would invite upheaval by stimulating popular expectations
                            and undermining the system centered on <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> that has provided stability so far.</p>
                        <p>There are limited economic, political, and military reforms, however,
                            that would not threaten his regime, and might well strengthen it. Even
                            these <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> would not be likely
                            to make in the absence of foreign pressure; he realizes he must be
                            responsive to his external supporters.</p>
                        <p>By allowing foreign powers to assume key roles in addressing some of
                            Zaire’s major problems, <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>
                            gains room for maneuver and links Belgium, France, and the United States
                            to his own survival.</p>
                        <p>The impact of placing some distance between the United States and
                                <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> would be minor in the
                            absence of concurrent action by France and Belgium, which are likely to
                            continue to support him regardless of his response to pressures for
                            change.</p>
                        <p>Pent-up pressures in Kinshasa could explode at any time and topple
                                <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>, and he could be
                            challenged from unexpected quarters. Revolt has been averted thus far
                            because of disarray within the opposition, <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName>’s skillful manipulation of potential challengers,
                            repression by the security forces, and apprehension among many Zairians
                            that the country without him would return to the chaos of the early
                            1960s. Zaire’s size and diversity reduce the chance that a revolt, once
                            started, could spread. Moreover, African social institutions provide
                            safety valves that relieve somewhat the intense pressures of urban
                            poverty.</p>
                        <p>If <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> were to depart the
                            scene, it is possible that he would be quickly replaced by a military
                            junta which could hold the country together. It is more likely, however,
                            that a prolonged and bloody struggle for power would ensue. The turmoil
                            could well spread from Kinshasa to other parts of the country, reviving
                            secessionist tendencies. Turbulence or disintegration in Zaire could
                            hardly fail to have an impact on Zaire’s neighbors in a variety of ways,
                            not the least of which is the possibility that Zaire would again become
                            a theater for rivalries among external powers.</p>
                        <p>A major impact of <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>’s
                            replacement by an anti-Western regime would be on the African, European,
                            and Arab perceptions of the United States. Conservative African leaders
                            might see it as a further shift in the balance of forces against them;
                            Europeans and Arabs would see it as further evidence of the United
                            States’ inability or unwillingness to protect its friends.</p>
                        <p rend="center">DISCUSSION</p>
                        <p>1. Zaire’s problems loom larger to the United States and other Western
                            countries than those of most other African nations, even though similar
                            difficulties can also be found elsewhere on the continent. <pb n="348"
                                facs="0380" xml:id="pg_348"/>First, Zaire’s size, economic
                            potential, and mineral resources make its international alignment
                            important to the West. Second, its regime is closely associated by much
                            of the world with the West in general and with the United States in
                            particular. Third, the plight of its people, in the face of inefficient
                            government and economic regression, and the association of President
                                <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>’s government with
                            corruption and arbitrary treatment of his people have led many in the
                            West to question the morality of Western support for his regime.</p>
                        <p>2. The military incursion into the mineral-rich Shaba region in March
                            1977 by Zairian exiles based in Angola revealed the extent to which the
                                <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> regime had been
                            weakened by a combination of world market factors and poor management
                            since its zenith in 1972–73. In response to growing domestic and
                            international pressures, the latter principally from the United States,
                                <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> announced in July
                            1977 that major political, military, and economic reforms would be
                            implemented. The most significant political reforms proved to be the
                            holding of competitive elections to fill seats in the legislature, the
                            members of which had previously been appointed, and the creation of the
                            office of prime minister. Responsibility for upgrading Zaire’s armed
                            forces was placed primarily on the Belgian and French military missions.
                            The resultant Belgian-trained 21st Infantry Brigade and the
                            French-trained 31st Paratroop Brigade represent a significant
                            strengthening of Zaire’s military capability. The central elements of
                            economic reform in Zaire have been adherence to an International
                            Monetary Fund standby agreement and reliance on expatriates to staff key
                            positions at the Bank of Zaire, the Ministry of Finance, and
                            Customs.</p>
                        <p>3. In general, there now are two contending schools of thought concerning
                            reform. Some believe that the present regime can be brought to a point
                            of significant reform, that some of the changes that <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> has already made are
                            irreversible and will alter the nature of the regime. Others contend
                            that no real change has occurred and that <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> must go if the current “<hi rend="italic">mal
                                Zairois</hi>” is to be cured.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Belgian Legacy: The Early Years in the
                            Congo</p>
                        <p>4. Although the difficulties that President <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> and his predecessors have faced in trying to
                            establish Zaire as a viable and cohesive state are hardly unique in
                            Africa, the legacy of Belgium’s colonial paternalism and its hasty
                            retreat from its principal African territory virtually assured an
                            inauspicious beginning. In contrast to the relatively orderly
                            preparations for independence that were instituted by the French and
                            British—in which political parties took root and aspiring politicians
                            were gradually brought into the administrative and political systems—the
                            Congolese were grossly ill prepared to take over the administration of
                            the new state.</p>
                        <p><pb n="349" facs="0381" xml:id="pg_349"/>5. By the time <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> seized power in 1965, Zaire had
                            experienced practically everything that could go wrong in a newly
                            independent African country. Independence was followed by an Army
                            mutiny, debilitating political infighting, fragmentation of the country
                            along ethnic lines, three regional secessions, and a series of peasant
                            uprisings. Many of these developments were exacerbated by outside
                            interests, including those of some West European and Communist nations.
                            Five years of independence had left the political, economic, and social
                            life of the country in ruins.</p>
                        <p>6. The pre-<persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> regimes
                            depended heavily on external economic and technical assistance,
                            including the continued service of large numbers of foreign civilian and
                            military specialists. Indeed, the foreign rescue operations that were
                            mobilized to maintain the country’s viability during the tumultuous
                            early 1960s—ranging from economic inputs from aid contributors and
                            private investors to <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> peacekeeping
                            forces—have remained permanent features of Zaire’s history. They were
                            manifested more recently by the French, Belgian, and Moroccan
                            involvement in the Shaba crises of 1977 and 1978 and by international
                            efforts to maintain the government’s solvency. Unlike many other African
                            countries where foreign involvement is rebuffed as neocolonialism, or at
                            least is less visible to the outside world, Zaire under <persName

                            Foreign involvement has become an essential part of the way <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> manipulates the country’s

                        <p>7. Even <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>’s harshest critics
                            grudgingly acknowledge his success in maintaining a reasonable degree of
                            domestic peace and order in Zaire. Except for opponents within the
                            Zairian elite, many observers until recently found few faults with
                                <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>’s efforts at
                            maintaining stability. They viewed the political system he began to
                            construct after he came to power as being not markedly unlike regimes
                            that were emerging in other parts of the continent as African leaders
                            replaced the political frameworks left behind by the former metropoles.
                            Such moves as the establishment of the <gloss target="#t_MPR_1"
                                >MPR</gloss> (Popular Revolutionary Movement) as the sole political
                            party and the gradual extension of <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName>’s control over the armed forces were seen as
                            logical steps to strengthen the central government and prevent a return
                            to chaos.</p>
                        <p>8. Neighboring states were relieved that “the Congo problem” no longer
                            threatened their own stability and shared the general African
                            satisfaction that a blemish had been removed from Africa’s record.
                            During the “Pax <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>” period
                            that lasted through the early 1970s and was marked by relatively
                            substantial revenues from copper and other mineral resources, few

                            was governed, but instead were more concerned with the investment

                        <p>9. Although the innermost workings of <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName>’s circle of cronies and advisers remain obscure,
                            the basic details of how his system works are generally known and have
                            not changed significantly since he took power. He rules more as a
                            paramount tribal chief than as a head of state in the Western sense. He
                            is secretive, ruthless (although less so in recent years), and
                            politically astute, and has a talent for catching potential challengers
                            and foreign leaders off balance and for exploiting tribal jealousies. He
                            adroitly handles the military, judiciously dispenses largesse and
                            punishment, funds pet projects, and indulges in luxuries without being
                            directly accountable to any authority. He also rules by employing a
                            crisis management approach to problems, marshaling seemingly nonexistent
                            domestic and external resources to resolve or defer what appear to
                            others as insoluble economic and political problems.</p>

                                >Mobutu</persName> distrusts Western-style democratic institutions
                            because he believes they would give free reign to the divided loyalties
                            and opportunism that have disrupted Zaire in the past. In the early
                            1970s, when Zaire had emerged from a decade of internal rebellions,
                                <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> embarked on a series
                            of political changes that were intended to create the framework of a
                            one-party state, to introduce into Zaire something of the aura of an
                            African “radical” state, and to give himself the legitimacy that came
                            from identification with the African political mainstream. Perhaps the
                            best known of these enterprises was his unsuccessful attempt to carry
                            out his campaign for “authenticity”—a kind of cultural revolution which
                            had precedents in other African countries and which emphasized political
                            solidarity by stressing the introduction of “authentic” indigenous
                            practices to replace “colonial” ways (for example, changes in personal
                            names from Europeanized to vernacular forms). This was also an attempt
                            to create a sense of national unity, no doubt inspired by <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>’s confidence that he was in
                            full control and by the vague philosophies of other African leaders who
                            have sought to construct a framework for their own particular style of
                            rule. In the event, neither authenticity in its various ramifications
                            nor any of the other innovations that <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"

                            deep root and Zaire’s political system has remained a highly
                            personalized one.</p>

                        <p>11. After 15 years, “Pax Mobutu” is still little more than a truce

                            domination of the instruments of power. Tribal and regional tensions
                            persist, and social and economic problems—including inflation,
                            unemployment, labor and student unrest, periodic shortages of
                            necessities, and deteriorating infrastructure—are now acute.</p>
                        <p>12. Many factors contribute to Zaire’s current difficulties—including a
                            severe deterioration of the terms of trade, the invasions of Shaba,
                            costly economic blunders, the burgeoning foreign debt, and the pilfering
                            of scarce foreign exchange. The resulting deterioration of the economy
                            and public services has stimulated public discontent, while
                            international concern over human rights has rallied some of <persName

                            domestic problems have been compounded by his tendency—for a variety of

                            rather than their causes.</p>
                        <p>13. In gauging his response to the pressures on his regime, <persName

                            there are divergent views among those who advocate change. Longtime
                            Zairian opponents both inside and outside the country seem to believe
                            that any change must be accompa<pb n="352" facs="0384" xml:id="pg_352"

                            The United States and, to a lesser extent, France and Belgium recognize
                            the need for stringent fiscal and monetary measures to halt the economic
                            decline, but only the United States also places emphasis on the
                            necessity of internal political changes. For the Belgians and French,
                            economic recovery programs that result in nondisruptive political
                            changes are acceptable, and Paris and Brussels seem content to let the
                            United States take the lead and act as the lightning rod for any adverse
                            reactions from <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>.</p>
                        <p>14. <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> believes he has the
                            support of the Europeans regardless of his response to reform pressures.
                            He also probably reasons that his critics are limited in dealing with
                            him by the fear of severe unrest and an even less palatable outcome if
                            he should leave the scene. <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> has responded skillfully to these various
                            pressures, dragging out his response while he seeks to play off the
                            outside players against each other, and at the same time weighing the
                            impact of his actions on his control of the internal situation.</p>
                        <p>15. <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> has apparently
                            concluded that the United States and his domestic opponents have similar
                            notions about the changes that should be implemented. Although he
                            realizes that no reforms will satisfy the Zairian intellectual elite,
                            both this group and the United States tend to advocate structural
                            changes in the government that accord with Western conceptions of how
                            reform is induced. Consequently, <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> has only tinkered with the country’s thinly
                            rooted institutions. Among other things, he has appointed a Prime
                            Minister and given him some responsibilities in the day-to-day
                            operations of the government. The legislature has been allowed to voice
                            some criticism of the regime. A number of corrupt officials have been
                            replaced by competent technocrats, and a cabinet shakeup earlier this
                            year appears to have improved the overall competence of the government’s
                            ministers. Against this backdrop, some judicial reforms have been
                            enacted and amnesties for criminals and political dissidents have been
                            announced in order to placate those who point out the repressive nature
                            of his rule. Nevertheless, each move has usually been followed at some
                            point by other actions that are intended to signal to domestic critics
                            that <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> is not prepared to
                            go too far. In essence, he continues to rely primarily on his keen
                            understanding of the system he has created to maintain himself in
                            power.</p>
                        <p>16. <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> has shrewdly delegated
                            major responsibility for solving the economic crisis to Western advisers
                            and governments that are deeply involved in Zaire. By depending on them
                            to come up with stopgap financial aid, to reassure and work with
                            overseas financial institutions and investors, and to oversee Zaire’s
                            banking and customs operations, he has linked the United States, France,
                            and Belgium to his own survival—a move which enables him in part to
                            deflect domestic criticism of the economic situation to outsiders.</p>
                        <p><pb n="353" facs="0385" xml:id="pg_353"/>17. <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> has pursued a similar strategy in the military
                            sphere. Because the armed forces are both the base of <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>’s support and a potential
                            threat to his rule, he probably has ruled out extensive changes in the
                            military that would threaten his control of the officer corps. Economic
                            constraints weigh against any substantial arms expenditures, and a need
                            for continuous security has ruled out replacement of existing forces by
                            totally new ones. Instead, prompted partly by Western pressure and
                            partly by his own recognition of the need for improvement, <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> has put in train a series of
                            important, though less sweeping, measures—reduction in the number of
                            troops, creation of three new brigades, improvements in messing and pay,
                            streamlining the chain of command, retraining a poorly disciplined
                            infantry division, and establishment of a logistics corps. With the
                            exception of the last two of these, measurable albeit halting progress
                            has been made, although this has depended on about 200 Belgian and
                            French advisers, some of whom accompany and command the units they have
                            trained. <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> and key armed
                            forces officers hope the reforms already made will become sufficiently
                            institutionalized to last beyond the tenure of these advisers. One of
                            the most significant of the reforms—the infusion of discipline in the
                            armed forces—has proved less effective. Thus far, with the exception of
                            the Belgian- and French-advised units, there does not seem to have been
                            a significant crackdown designed to impress on the troops the importance
                            of discipline.</p>

                                >Mobutu</persName> has provided room for maneuver to continue his
                            balancing act of maintaining himself in power while others tackle the
                            intricacies of economic recovery and keep the regime afloat with
                            financial aid and economic assistance. While this allows the United
                            States, and to a lesser extent France and Belgium, to maintain some
                            pressure on <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> to reduce the
                            flagrantly corrupt practices that are part of his regime, <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>’s response thus far strongly
                            suggests that fundamental political reform—in Western terms—is neither
                            his intention nor in his perception a possibility. Most of the basic
                            decisions affecting the country’s economic life will continue to be made
                            in his office. <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> doubtless
                            would allow further limited changes in the government and bureaucracy in
                            order to appear responsive, calculating that the high officials and
                            civil servants who are affected by such changes will be content to seek
                            ways around them to survive economically.</p>
                        <p>19. <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> is no doubt aware of
                            the pressure on his principal foreign supporters to distance themselves
                            from his regime, although he probably has fewer doubts about France’s
                            resolve than he does about that of the United States or Belgium. He may
                            reason, however, <pb n="354" facs="0386" xml:id="pg_354"/>that his
                            critics in the international community have been unable to offer a
                            candidate for succession and that active opponents of serious stature
                            either in Zaire or among the Zairian exiles abroad do not exist. He also
                            perceives that most of the international community attaches as much—if
                            not more—importance to access to Zaire’s mineral resources and to the
                            country’s potential for affecting regional stability as to internal
                            reform. Even those nearby African leaders who dislike <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> and are highly sensitive to
                            foreign military rescue operations in support of African regimes would
                            probably argue against disengagement on the grounds that Africa’s and
                            the West’s interests would not be served if <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName>’s departure brought a return to the situation
                            that existed in Zaire before he came to power. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> views his trip to Europe and
                            the United States late last year, his private contacts with French
                            President Giscard, and French willingness to conclude occasional
                            bilateral economic deals that circumvent the <gloss target="#t_IMF_1"
                                >IMF</gloss> program as commitments to his survival.</p>
                        <p>20. While <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> may perceive
                            that the downward trend of US economic and military assistance
                            represents a gradual disengagement, he could conclude that his ties to
                            the French and the Belgians, and to conservative Arab governments that
                            provide financial handouts, are sufficiently firm to enable him to lash
                            out at the United States, as he has done in the past when tensions have
                            arisen in US-Zairian relations. If he judges that US pressures for
                            reform are excessive, he might calculate that the US commitment to Zaire
                            is so deep that a US response to any action he might take would be
                            limited and would not endanger US-Zairian relations. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> might gauge the success of any
                            anti-US move on the lack of a negative US response to his stage-managed
                            ouster of the US Ambassador in mid-1975.</p>
                        <p>21. On the other hand, <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> has
                            seen his margin of maneuver reduced by Zaire’s growing dependence on
                            external financial assistance. Moreover, his exaggerated perception of
                            US influence on the <gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss> (and the World
                            Bank) has contributed to his acceptance, however reluctant, of far more
                            US infringement on what he considers Zairian sovereignty than would have
                            been conceivable in 1975.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Impact of Reform on Stability</p>
                        <p>22. Fundamental political changes designed to liberalize the regime would
                            substantially increase chances for instability by stimulating
                            expectations and undermining the system <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> has assembled for maintaining control. If
                            implemented now, these measures—such as creation of impersonal
                            institutions and independent sources of power, introduction of a
                            multi-party system, or devolution of significant lawmaking authority to
                            parliament or regional bodies—would likely unleash the divisive
                            tendencies in Zaire that <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>
                            so far has managed to contain and use to his own advantage.</p>
                        <p><pb n="355" facs="0387" xml:id="pg_355"/>23. More limited changes,
                            however, unless adopted simultaneously, would probably not threaten
                                <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>’s regime and might
                            well strengthen it by allowing dissidents to vent their dissatisfaction
                            in a controlled environment. Permitting the legislature to elect its
                            officers without presidential interference would be one such measure, as
                            would making regional assemblies centers of discussion about local
                            problems. He could also grant his appointed prime minister authority to
                            select and dismiss cabinet members.</p>
                        <p>24. The security forces likely offer somewhat more room for
                            nonthreatening improvement than does the strictly political sphere.
                            Further efforts to bolster the morale and effectiveness of troops—better
                            training, more efficient pay and quartermaster systems, some new
                            barracks and medical facilities, tighter discipline—would probably
                            improve <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>’s position by
                            raising security force capabilities marginally. But dramatic improvement
                            of military effectiveness would require stressing competence over ethnic
                            background and personal loyalty to <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> within the officer corps. The President would
                            have to relinquish control over officer assignments and
                            perquisites—which would greatly improve chances of an eventual move by a
                            military unit against him.</p>
                        <p>25. There is also a margin for additional reform in the economic arena.
                            Although <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> will continue to
                            need both ample funds for direct payoffs to key supporters and
                            opportunities for them to exploit public positions for private gain,
                            there appears to be considerable room for retrenchment in these areas.
                            Progress on managing Zaire’s foreign exchange earnings and reducing
                            payroll skimming, for example, might cramp <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName>’s style somewhat but at no real political
                            cost.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Reasons for Absence of Revolt</p>
                        <p>26. Many observers wonder why major disturbances have not already
                            occurred in view of the deteriorating quality of life in Zaire. They
                            have argued that the chief danger to the <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> government would come in the form of spontaneous
                            uprisings in such locales as Kinshasa and other urban centers. Aside
                            from the <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> system that has
                            been described, there are other factors that we believe have contributed
                            to stability. Some are specific to <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName>’s Zaire: his manipulation of potential rivals,
                            the relative efficacy of his security forces, the Zairian population’s
                            belief that the United States, France, and Belgium would intervene to
                            prop him up, and the widespread desire to avoid a repetition of the
                            violence of the early 1960s. Others, including ethnicity and income
                            redistribution within the extended family, are features general to
                            Africa.</p>
                        <p>27. During his 15-year tenure, <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> has been extraordinarily successful in
                            controlling military plotting and political intrigue. Through a variety
                            of methods—arrests, intimidation, bribery, rewards, <pb n="356"
                                facs="0388" xml:id="pg_356"/>and the shuffling of portfolios—he has
                            been able to keep potential rivals off balance. His practice of filling
                            government positions with individuals from minor ethnic groups means
                            that there are few persons in positions of power who could command broad
                            support. In the military, he has encouraged factionalism and promoted
                            ethnic and regional tensions. He has periodically manipulated the chain
                            of command to help keep the Army from becoming a unified, cohesive
                            force. He has, moreover, staffed key military positions with presumably
                            trusted officers from his own tribe or region.</p>
                        <p>28. Nevertheless, the military has the potential for a successful move
                            against <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>, so he pays
                            careful attention to it. No senior officers known to us present
                            immediate threats to <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>’s
                            control. Any officer, regardless of his competence, who appears to be
                            attracting a following of his own is shifted promptly to another job.
                            Senior officers still need <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName>—as do most members of his entourage—more than he
                            needs them. This situation is likely to persist at least as long as the
                            effective leaders of elite troops are the foreign training officers, now
                            Belgian and French.</p>
                        <p>29. There is no obvious leader to galvanize discontent and exploit the
                            regime’s shortcomings. With the exception of a vague feeling of
                            “anti-Mobutuism,” there is no one ideology that appeals to a majority of
                            Zairians. Most of <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>’s
                            opposition is based outside the country, either in Europe or in
                            neighboring countries. With the exception of the Front for the National
                            Liberation of the Congo (FLNC: ex-Katangan gendarmes), which has some
                            contacts inside the Shaba region, external opponents have few links
                            within Zaire. They are unable to organize effectively, and none has an
                            effective propaganda machine. Although France and Belgium host numerous
                                anti-<persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> groups and
                            individuals, these governments have not and probably would not allow
                            such groups to engage in serious action to destabilize the regime even
                            if they possessed the potential to do so.</p>
                        <p>30. Another factor is the effectiveness of the security services—the Army
                            and security police. Although ragtag and unprofessional by Western
                            standards, they can contain limited local uprisings and are able to
                            monitor antigovernment activities both at home and abroad. Moreover,
                            their reputation for brutality also acts as a deterrent.</p>
                        <p>31. The implications of perceived US support for Zaire are more valuable
                            to <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> than the actual
                            assistance he receives. Although many educated Zairians believe that the
                            French and the Belgians also would be likely to intervene on <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>’s behalf, they have the notion
                            that Paris and Brussels—despite significantly larger interests to
                            protect in Zaire—take their cue from Washington. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>’s detractors believe that this
                            foreign support bolsters the incumbent and preserves the status quo, and
                            this belief, which <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>
                            reinforces, is also a major inhibitor of meaningful opposition.</p>
                        <p><pb n="357" facs="0389" xml:id="pg_357"/>32. An additional important
                            factor that probably limits the potential for revolt is the population’s
                            fear of a repetition of the internal violence that characterized Zaire
                            in the early 1960s. <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>’s
                            demise could touch off domestic instability that no single Zairian
                            figure would be able to calm. Although disgruntled, many Zairians simply
                            are apolitical; others believe that things could get worse without
                                <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>.</p>
                        <p>33. While a less tangible explanation for the absence of revolt, it
                            appears that most Zairians do not expect much from the regime. This
                            probably works in the President’s favor by lessening demands that might
                            otherwise be placed on the government. The inclination of Zairians to
                            accept situations they perceive as being beyond their control also works
                            to <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>’s advantage.</p>
                        <p>34. The country’s size, diversity, and lack of social cohesion helps
                            prevent the coalescence of a viable opposition. The central government’s
                            presence in Zaire’s diverse regions, tenuous at best since independence,
                            has deteriorated still further in recent years. Several of Zaire’s
                            regions are so physically and psychologically separated from Kinshasa
                            that they are part of the country in name only. Deteriorating roads,
                            shortages of fuel, and limited contact between the capital and the
                            outlying regions contribute to their relative isolation and lessen the
                            likelihood that a revolt would spread.</p>
                        <p>35. Ethnic and regional cleavages that migrants bring with them to the
                            cities remain deeply rooted. This insularity helps to prevent the
                            coalescence of a broadly based dissidence in Kinshasa or in other urban
                            areas.</p>
                        <p>36. “Safety valves” to ameliorate economic hardships in the urban areas
                            to some degree belie the statistical indicators pointing to ever
                            declining living standards. Principal among these safety valves is the
                            village origin of many urban dwellers. In times of shortages or
                            hardship, family members go to their home villages to be fed and cared
                            for; when they return they bring food mostly for family consumption but
                            for sale as well. Some observers point out that 80 percent of all urban
                            women are engaged in some sort of market activity; this contributes in
                            small degree to alleviating the distress of urban workers.</p>
                        <p>37. Because of the responsibilities inherent in the extended family
                            system, those members with jobs or other resources must help less
                            fortunate relatives. This is in effect an informal but effective income
                            redistribution and welfare system that relieves an otherwise bleak
                            economic situation.</p>
                        <p>38. These arguments for the absence of revolt do not necessarily lead to
                            the conclusion that <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> will
                            be in power indefinitely. They do suggest, however, that the individual
                            or group working to replace him will not be visible until very shortly
                            before the action, if then, and may come from unexpected quarters. For
                            example, noncommissioned <pb n="358" facs="0390" xml:id="pg_358"/>and
                            junior officers, who were clearly a major factor in Ethiopia, Ghana, and
                            Liberia, could strike similarly in Zaire.</p>

                        <p>39. The threat to sever or reduce the close US relationship to the regime
                            is Washington’s main source of influencing <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> to adopt reform measures he would otherwise shun.
                            This is not, however, a very powerful source of leverage, and is
                            diminishing as other supporters have adopted comparatively stronger
                            roles in the wake of the two Shaba invasions. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>’s prospects for political
                            survival would not be seriously diminished by a withdrawal of US
                            support, although it would likely encourage some opponents of the
                            regime. A clear signal that the United States would not intervene to
                            rescue <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> from a Shaba III
                            or an uprising in Kinshasa would not have a significant impact on the
                            stability of the regime in the absence of concurrent action by France
                            and Belgium. A drastic reduction of US aid would probably not trigger
                            similar reactions by France and Belgium, and might even stimulate
                            greater support by them. The impact on regional stability of a
                            unilateral US withdrawal would likely be minimal, but would be of
                            concern to other African nations and might tempt the Soviet Union to
                            exploit Zairian weaknesses.</p>
                        <p>40. If, on the other hand, France and Belgium were to follow the US lead
                            and withdraw their military personnel and their general support for
                                <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>, the threat to his
                            survival would increase markedly. The effectiveness and political
                            reliability of key military units would rapidly decline. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>’s opponents, both internal and

                                >Mobutu</persName>’s style of rule would probably become
                            progressively more harsh and repressive. <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> would likely be desperate for foreign support and

                        <p>42. There is no question that Zaire’s size, its location in Africa, and
                            its mineral wealth make it an important country. The impact on US
                            interests of <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>’s
                            disappearance or overthrow would depend on the ability of a successor
                            regime to maintain order. While there is a possibility that a military
                            junta could manage this, we think it more likely that a prolonged and
                            bloody struggle for power would ensue. <pb n="359" facs="0391"
                                xml:id="pg_359"/>The turmoil could well spread from Kinshasa to
                            other parts of the country, reviving secessionist tendencies. Turbulence
                            or disintegration in Zaire could hardly fail to impact on Zaire’s
                            neighbors in a variety of ways, not the least of which is the
                            possibility that Zaire would again become a theater for rivalries among
                            external powers.</p>
                        <p>43. In these circumstances Moscow would be tempted to intervene. Already
                            present in considerable numbers in some neighboring countries, the
                            Soviets and their Cuban allies might be convinced that they eventually
                            could win out in Zaire. Although most of <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName>’s known opponents are not favorably disposed to
                            the Soviets, backing from Moscow or Havana could be the crucial
                            difference enabling new leaders to seize and maintain power. The degree
                            to which the Soviets and Cubans would seek to become actively involved
                            in shaping a post-<persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> Zaire
                            would depend on a multitude of factors, including Soviet commitments and
                            activities elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>44. Assuming that Zaire’s cobalt production facilities are not destroyed,
                            we are not greatly alarmed by the potential for denial of Zaire’s
                            mineral resources to the West. Zaire’s own need for foreign exchange
                            would make it very difficult for any government in Kinshasa to use its
                            strength in cobalt supplies to exert leverage on Western countries. An
                            unexpected and protracted cutoff of Zaire’s cobalt, however, would
                            seriously affect Western industry. (See the annex.)</p>
                        <p>45. This probably understates the noise in the world that would arise
                            from <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>’s overthrow and
                            replacement by an anti-Western regime. A major impact might well be in
                            the perceptions of African, West European, and Arab political
                            strategists. Few now find <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>
                            attractive as a national leader, but he continues, because of his past
                            history of association with the United States and the West, to represent
                            what was, at least at one time, a significant Western victory over
                            hostile tendencies. Conservative African leaders might see <persName

                        <p rend="center">ZAIRE’S MINERAL IMPORTANCE TO THE WEST: THE COBALT
                            CONNECTION</p>
                        <p>1. US strategic interests in Zaire, along with those of most other
                            industrial powers outside the Communist world, are influenced by their
                            almost total reliance on imported cobalt and by Zaire’s prominent role
                            in supply of this critical metal. Prized for its unique qualities,
                            cobalt is regarded as essential and virtually irreplaceable in some 60
                                <pb n="360" facs="0392" xml:id="pg_360"/>percent of its uses by
                            volume in the United States. These include, for example: high
                            temperature, stress-resistant superalloys for jet engines;
                            abrasive-resistant surfaces for tools, dies, and drill bits; and
                            catalysts for petroleum hydrogenation.</p>
                        <p>2. In terms of non-Communist world needs for cobalt, Zaire has been and
                            will remain crucially important. Specifically, it accounts for well over
                            half of the new cobalt entering the market each year. Last year, Zaire’s
                            output of 14,000 metric tons represented 57 percent of the non-Communist
                            world’s cobalt production, overshadowing that by any other producer. We
                            do not believe that recent output gains and plans of other cobalt
                            producers portend any significant diminution of Zaire’s share in world
                            cobalt production over the near future. In terms of land-based reserves,
                            no other country has Zaire’s capability for expanding output.</p>
                        <p>3. This heavy reliance on Zaire takes on special significance because of
                            existing and potential threats to output. Zaire’s cobalt industry has
                            been increasingly strained by shortages of spare parts, inadequate
                            maintenance, need for new equipment, and more recently by shortages of
                            badly needed foreign technical and supervisory personnel. A major
                            breakdown or accident that would defy on-site capabilities for repair
                            could result in a major loss of output for a considerable time. Along
                            with the possibilities of accidental damage, Zaire’s cobalt industry,
                            with its weak plant security, is highly vulnerable to sabotage. Action
                            by just a few individuals against key units, [<hi rend="italic">1 line
                                not declassified</hi>] could, in the view of experts, shut down
                            operations for a considerable period.</p>
                        <p>4. Stoppage in the supply of Zairian cobalt for a few months or so
                            probably would not cause serious hardship to any consuming country,
                            particularly in the light of current market conditions. If the cutoff
                            were protracted, we think that within a year, serious strains and
                            dislocations would be felt by cobalt-consuming industries in a number of
                            countries—particularly those with heavy traditional ties to Zairian
                            supplies. Included in this list are the United States, West Germany, the
                            United Kingdom, and Italy. If the US situation should warrant
                            Presidential declaration of a “national emergency,” strategic reserves
                            could be allocated to keep defense and other essential producers
                            operating for some time; the other countries would face serious
                            operating problems.</p>
                        <p>5. The United Kingdom and West Germany would feel the impact sooner and
                            to a greater extent than the United States, since neither country has
                            meaningful national stockpiles of cobalt or much flexibility to employ
                            substitutes in cobalt consuming industries. France, on the other hand,
                            could stave off serious hardships for a considerably longer period,
                            because it not only receives the bulk of its cobalt from Morocco but has
                            some national stockpiles to fall back on. Japan probably also would feel
                            the impact later than most, since it processes most of its <pb n="361"
                                facs="0393" xml:id="pg_361"/>cobalt from non-Zairian materials and
                            can employ substitutes to a greater extent than most industrial users.
                            Although the effects might be deferred longer in some countries than
                            others, it seems clear that loss of some half of non-Communist world
                            cobalt supply would take its toll directly or indirectly on all

                            with me the thoughts on Zaire’s future and its potential role in
                            Southern Africa. I was pleased to note your continued dedication to
                            working with the International Monetary Fund, as well as with Zaire’s
                            bilateral assistance partners, to reinvigorate the Zairian economy.</p>
                        <p>This is an important step in building on the progress Zaire and its
                            advisors have made in restarting the development process in Zaire.</p>
                        <p>An “extended fund facility” has worked to the benefit of other countries
                            with financial problems similar to those now faced by Zaire, and I
                            understand that the International Monetary Fund has responded positively
                            to your request for an extended arrangement.<note n="3" xml:id="d135fn3"
                                >In telegram 203268 to Kinshasa, July 31, the Department reported

                                need for an “extended fund facility” after assessing its performance

                                Foreign Policy File, D800368–0027)</note> Although the conditions
                            attached to this type of program are stringent, the potential long term
                            benefits are great. You can be assured of our interest in your
                            negotiations with the International Monetary Fund and of our strong
                            support for longer and more generous fund arrangements with those
                            members prepared to undertake equally far-reaching commitments.</p>
                        <p>I sincerely hope that Zaire will be able to reach agreement with the
                            International Monetary Fund quickly and in a manner that will reinforce
                            the economic progress Zaire has already made. Further strengthening of
                            the Zairian economy will also give you more latitude to advance the
                            important initiatives for regional economic and political cooperation
                            that you have recently put forward.</p>
                        <p>I will continue to follow with great interest your government’s efforts
                            to improve the lot of the Zairian people. Sincerely, <persName

                                this diplomatic activity is not likely to show clear results for
                                36–48 hours. It may have to be supplemented by further diplomatic
                                activity.</p>
                            <p>It was the consensus of the Working Group that our strategy at this

                                but not to do so publicly. It is the State Department’s judgment
                                that <hi rend="italic">public</hi> pressure will only provoke

                                extremis and that we should avoid preparations now which would

                            <p>However, the aircraft carrier Enterprise and some other supporting
                                cruisers are in the general area. They have been directed to proceed
                                to a position 100 miles off the coast of Kenya. At the current rate
                                of advance (20 knots), the Enterprise will arrive at noon tomorrow.
                                Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCW_1">Duncan</persName> is
                                concerned that if the fact of the Enterprise’s movements become
                                public knowledge, this could be seized by <persName
                                    corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName> as a pretext for further
                                action. You should be aware that the Enterprise is being shadowed by
                                Soviet ships and planes, and the Soviets could well inform <persName

                            <p>Everyone believes it is only prudent to move the Enterprise into the
                                area although it would have no value in helping us evacuate
                                Americans. It is capable only of offensive operations. It is
                                probably desirable therefore to slow the carrier down or alter
                                course slightly so that its mission is not so evident in the next 24
                                hours.</p>

                            <p>It was agreed that it might be desirable to offer to send an airplane

                            wave of killings in Uganda. He also professes to fear a foreign attack
                            although, again, it is hard to untangle when <persName

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName>’s current behavior follows
                            patterns well established over the past six years and is motivated by
                            the following:</p>
                        <p>—He is seeking foreign scapegoats to divert popular attention from
                            internal troubles and to keep his military opponents off balance. (There
                                <pb n="372" facs="0404" xml:id="pg_372"/>are at least half a dozen
                            active plots against <persName corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName>, some
                            involving the military and some the Ugandan political exiles headed by
                            former President <persName corresp="#p_OM_1">Milton
                            Obote</persName>.)</p>
                        <p>—His cultural background causes <persName corresp="#p_AID_1"
                                >Amin</persName> to blame other people rather than himself for his
                            troubles. Over the years, the Israelis, Asians, British, foreign
                            missionaries, and <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> have been
                            identified as mischievous outsiders who try to sow dissension among
                            Ugandans.</p>
                        <p>—He is immensely insecure and sees foreign missionaries (most of the 240
                            U.S. citizens are missionaries) as a source of opposition. Although he
                            has expelled some missionaries, including Americans, and has curtailed
                            church power, he still worries about the influence of the clergy and
                            religious teachers over the Christian community—roughly half of the
                            Ugandan population. This concern, rather than anti-Christian or
                            anti-white sentiments as such, has been the key to his approach toward
                            missionaries.</p>
                        <p>—He has a love-hate relationship with the West. His original takeover of
                            the government in January 1971 met with Western approbation, but within
                            the year the regime’s excesses, especially military bloodletting, and
                            the expulsion of the Asian community, had tarnished its image and
                            impaired relations with the UK and US in particular. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName> acts like a spurned suitor. He
                            apparently still has a deep affection for the British and Israeli
                            military who trained him, yet he regards these countries as his
                            betrayers.</p>
                        <p>The continued absence of a U.S. Embassy in Kampala—closed in 1973,
                            primarily because of the security situation—is interpreted by <persName
                                corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName> as a rebuff to his periodic
                            overtures for better relations. He regards U.S. military aid to Kenya as
                            still additional evidence that we have lined up with his enemies.</p>
                        <p>The summoning of U.S. citizens in Uganda to a meeting on Monday is
                            undoubtedly the prelude to a period of humiliation, harassment, and
                            perhaps the expulsion of some or all of them. We doubt that <persName
                                corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName> intends to harm them physically,
                                <hi rend="italic">unless he is convinced the U.S. really is involved
                                in a military operation against him.</hi> But there is a great and
                            ever-present danger of ill-treatment or murder by <persName
                                corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName>’s barely-disciplined soldiers,
                            either while the Americans are en route to Kampala or once they have
                            arrived. (Another possibility is that Americans who do not hear of
                                <persName corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName>’s summons in time may
                            be summarily punished by <persName corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName>’s
                            soldiers.)</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName> has bullied and humiliated
                            Westerners on previous occasions, and in the 1975 case of a British
                            citizen—Denis Hills—imprisoned and threatened to execute them, but he
                            has stopped short of killing Westerners (in marked contrast to his
                            killing of Ugandans). There is one exception: <persName
                                corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName> probably ordered the killing of a
                            British citizen—Mrs. Dora Bloch—in the aftermath of the Israeli raid on
                            Entebbe. (Two <pb n="373" facs="0405" xml:id="pg_373"/>Americans, a

                        <p>The Charge answered that he assumed it was due to the tremendous amount
                            of unfavorable publicity and that his government had perhaps decided to
                            postpone the meeting to reduce tension. The Charge also said he had been

                            suggested that the Government of Uganda itself might help defuse the

                        <p>The more I think about it, the more I like the idea of evacuation by

                        <p>Ex-Ambassador Melady urges us to urge all Americans to get out of Uganda
                            finally, realizing that many won’t. One way of getting them <pb n="375"
                                facs="0407" xml:id="pg_375"/>out is to get in touch with their
                            religious superiors here in the States. (Melady did this in 1973 and got
                            the total down from over 1,000 to 200.) We could also tell Ellerkmann to
                            let them know we think they should leave while the going is good.</p>
                        <p>Pretty soon, the President is going to have to return to the theme of
                            human rights in Uganda generally. This will be a touchy problem, but we
                            can’t give the impression of (a) caring only about Americans or (b)
                            having been silenced by <persName corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName>’s

                            to Topple President <persName corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName></p>
                        <p>The assassination or overthrow of President <persName corresp="#p_AID_1"
                                >Amin</persName> is likely to touch off a long period of unrest in
                            Uganda, especially in the military, the major prop of the <persName
                                corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName> regime. The Ugandan army,
                            traditionally an ill-disciplined force, has become even more unruly
                            during <persName corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName>’s six years of
                            maladministration. Military excesses have been a product of:</p>
                        <quote><p>—the privileged position of the armed forces and its virtually
                                unlimited police powers.</p>
                            <p>—the army’s fragmented, chaotic, or nonexistent lines of authority
                                resulting in part from <persName corresp="#p_AID_1"
                                >Amin</persName>’s frequent tribally-inspired purges of the officer
                                corps.</p>
                            <p>—aggravation of serious tribal, ethnic and religious frictions in the
                                army stemming from <persName corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName>’s
                                heavy recruitment and favored treatment of his fellow Muslims and
                                Sudanic tribesmen.</p></quote>
                        <p>Military indiscipline and turmoil is likely to intensify when what little
                            control <persName corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName> exercises by
                            loyalty, obeisance, or terror is removed with his departure from the
                            scene.</p>
                        <p>Fighting in the immediate post <persName corresp="#p_AID_1"
                                >Amin</persName> era is likely to erupt along tribal and ethnic
                            lines and among individual units as new loyalties are sorted out. Those
                            who have suffered at the hands of <persName corresp="#p_AID_1"
                                >Amin</persName> and his Muslim troops are likely to take the
                            opportunity to settle old scores. Recognizing their precarious position
                            without <persName corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName>, some of the
                            president’s followers may take advantage of the confusion immediately
                            following his downfall to take pre-emptive action against their
                            opponents. Others fearing for their lives, will probably melt away to
                            remote tribal areas such as the region straddling the Uganda-Sudan
                            border. In any event, without a cohesive military, whatever individual
                            or group succeeds <persName corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName> will have
                            considerable difficulty gaining control of the situation.</p>
                        <p>In addition to military turmoil, <persName corresp="#p_AID_1"
                                >Amin</persName>’s successors may have to contend with unrest among
                            segments of the civilian population seeking to preserve or reassert the
                            interests of the country’s disparate tribal groups. Members of Uganda’s
                            traditional kingdoms, such as Buganda, <pb n="377" facs="0409"
                                xml:id="pg_377"/>never fully resigned to the kingdom’s dissolution
                            under <persName corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName>’s predecessor, could
                            try to revive their once privileged position.</p>
                        <p>Uganda’s neighbors, especially Kenya and Tanzania, which have been
                            supporting anti-<persName corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName> groups, are
                            also likely to try to influence events in the immediate post-<persName
                                corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName> period. Long concerned about
                                <persName corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName> and his threats to
                            their security, Kenya and Tanzania may see the confusion following
                                <persName corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName>’s death as an
                            opportunity to ensure the rise of a more compatible government in
                            Kampala by insinuating into Uganda elements they have supported.</p>
                        <p>Despite any efforts by Kenya and Tanzania, it is unlikely that a civilian
                            government would emerge on top in Kampala in the immediate

                            a number of civilian groups plotting against <persName

                            the military. The latter groups probably have a good chance of toppling
                                <persName corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName> and playing a role in a
                            successor government, but little chance of dominating such a
                            government.</p>
                        <p>As a result of <persName corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName>’s purges,
                            there appears to be a dearth of widely respected Ugandan civilians
                            capable of bridging Uganda’s ethnic and tribal divisions and wielding
                            sufficient authority to control the situation without relying heavily on
                            the army. Most civilian leaders, either in Uganda or in exile, are not
                            well known or—like former President <persName corresp="#p_OM_1"
                                >Obote</persName>—command little respect in Uganda. One possible
                            exception is Paul Etiang, an outstanding and widely respected member of
                                <persName corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName>’s cabinet. Although
                            opposed to <persName corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName> and not trusted
                            by the president, Etiang has managed to survive and maintain a position
                            in the government.</p>
                        <p>It’s always possible that some unknown junior officer or group of lower
                            level officers could come out on top after a period of instability. This
                            scenario would be more likely if a large part of <persName
                                corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName>’s hierarchy were wiped out in his
                            downfall. Such a government would be marked by considerable maneuvering
                            for loyalties and positions of leadership and might find it necessary to
                            call on a senior exiled or currently out of favor military figure to
                            assume leadership.</p>
                        <p>It appears, however, that senior military officers—possibly those in
                                <persName corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName>’s hierarchy who survive
                            his downfall—would have the best chance of bringing some stability to
                            the situation, but again only after a period of bloodshed. The cast of
                            characters in the upper level of the military has changed frequently
                            since <persName corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName> came to power. Many
                            senior officers have been killed, disappeared, or lost favor with
                                <persName corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName>. Little is known of the
                            current military leadership except that most are Muslims from Sudanic
                            related tribes in northern Uganda and are members of the shadowy Defense
                            Council that is purported to advise <persName corresp="#p_AID_1"

                        <p>We cannot gauge with certainty the foreign policy to be followed by
                                <persName corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName> successors. It seems
                            likely, however, that a successor government will be inclined to follow
                            a moderate nonaligned course with some traditional African socialist
                            trappings. <persName corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName>’s successors
                            will probably reason that the country will need help from all quarters
                            in order to revitalize the economy and domestic institutions devastated
                            by <persName corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName>’s misrule. As a result,
                            they may seek closer ties to the West.</p>
                        <p>A military government will probably maintain ties to the Soviet Union,
                            Uganda’s principal arms supplier, at least over the short run. None of
                            the prominent leaders, however, seems closely aligned with the Soviets.
                            In fact the apparently heavy-handed Soviet advisory and supply role in
                            the military has probably created considerable suspicion and mistrust of
                            Moscow in the army hierarchy. In any event, the policies of a successor
                            government will almost certainly be more consistent than those of the
                            erratic <persName corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName>.</p>

                            moderate young President. He is quite aware of his political enemies,

                                >rpt</gloss> not personally go to the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1"

                        <p>3. I told <persName corresp="#p_BJ_1">Bagaza</persName> that with our
                            growing interest in Africa and our hopes in the next years to become
                            substantially more active in furnishing bilateral assistance to Burundi,
                            we were also more concerned to know where his government would be
                            leading the country. In regard to foreign policy orientation, we saw a
                            tendency to displace foreign experts, Western businessmen, and even some
                            missionaries. I had evidence that the Surete (secret police) checked up
                            on U.S. Embassy contacts with Burundian friends and worried about the
                            supposed preferences of American missionaries for Hutus. The media
                            talked more about divisions among Burundians between revolutionaries and
                            reactionaries, and the latter were linked to “imperialism”, which had
                            anti-Western connotations. It was a fact not only for the U.S. Embassy,
                            but for all Western Embassies, that the requirement that all social
                            contacts with Burundians be arranged through the Protocol Office had
                            severely chilled such contacts and led almost to their disappearance. In
                            regard to domestic policy, we noticed ever tighter controls over private
                            businesses (Burundian and foreign) and an increasing resort to state
                            intervention and regulation as a cure for all ills. I commented that
                            statism posed enough problems even in developed countries, but in
                            nations such as Burundi, with an inadequate number of well trained
                            officials, with weak bureaucratic traditions, and with strong habits of
                            corruption, unbridled statism could become a real burden on development.
                            I referred to the planned top level <gloss target="#t_UPRONA_1"

                            “seminar” in late July and asked whether it would be proclaiming a new
                            leftist shift in Burundi’s policies.</p>
                        <p>4. The President said that no Marxist program would be set forth for
                            Burundi, and the country would not become a socialist state. It would
                            remain non-aligned, but its primary orientation for development <pb
                                n="381" facs="0413" xml:id="pg_381"/>would be on the West. There
                            were more non-governmental Europeans in Burundi now than before
                            independence. He reiterated that his regime was reformist; it was trying
                            to create a new national spirit of unity and morality. Since the masses
                            of peasants, both Hutus and Tutsis, had suffered most from Micombero’s
                                misrule,<note n="7" xml:id="d144fn7">Former President Michel
                                Micombero was deposed by a military coup in November 1976.</note>
                            his government’s priority would be on rejuvenating the countryside and
                            modernizing it. However, mentalities had to change equally in the
                            cities. In the past, a small elitist clique in government and business
                            had worked hand in glove to appropriate for themselves a lopsided share
                            of the nation’s wealth, and this had occurred through every manner of
                            corruption and illegality. Of course, these privileged people were now
                            screaming for sympathy as they were forced to change their ways. They
                            knew how to approach foreigners to try to gain their support. This is
                            why the regime had quite deliberately sought to cut off contacts with
                            diplomats in November. But it was not <gloss target="#t_rpt_1"
                                >rpt</gloss> not true that there was any particular suspicion of
                            Americans or missionaries. I suggested that diplomats really did not
                                <gloss target="#t_rpt_1">rpt</gloss> not want to deal with political
                            has-beens, but with the ministers and officials now on the top. Hence,
                            the curtailment of social contacts for diplomats was self-defeating for
                            the regime. <persName corresp="#p_BJ_1">Bagaza</persName> said that
                            matters had now evolved far enough so that a relaxation on contacts
                            could start.</p>
                        <p>5. I also commented that a policy of moderate and controlled reform
                            needed leadership. The President had showed this during his two month
                            tour of the provinces at the beginning of the year, but now he was out
                            of the limelight and some observers said that there was a leadership
                            vacuum. If this was the case, other elements would try to fill it, and I
                            mentioned (<gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Ambassador) Simbananiye’s
                            attempts to return to a job in Burundi where he could intrigue more
                            successfully for his leftist and anti-Western policies. I could not
                                <gloss target="#t_rpt_1">rpt</gloss> not understand how he and
                            others in his group had escaped arrest when 80 or so others had been
                            jailed pending trial about five months ago for past corruption. I cited
                            what I had personally heard about the embezzlement and misappropriation
                            of public funds of Simbananiye, Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_NE_1">Nzambimana</persName> (when he was Public Works
                            Minister in the old regime), and several current ambassadors.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_BJ_1">Bagaza</persName> said I seemed to be well
                            informed even without social contacts. He knew of these charges against
                            people who held high posts in the new government. However, one could not
                                <gloss target="#t_rpt_1">rpt</gloss> not arrest such people for
                            trial without documentary or other very strong proof. On the other hand,
                            their continued presence in high posts would not <gloss
                                target="#t_rpt_1">rpt</gloss> not prevent their dismissal and arrest
                            if proof were found. I asked <pb n="382" facs="0414" xml:id="pg_382"
                            />whether he was saying that, since most of these people had helped him
                            to make the coup d’etat on November first, he was more or less in debt
                            to them politically and thus had to accommodate his principles somewhat
                            to political realities. <persName corresp="#p_BJ_1">Bagaza</persName>
                            said that I must know of the inherent instabilities in Burundi, which
                            had created divisions between ethnic groups, regions, and clans. It was
                            essential to put all this behind them if a modern society was ever to
                            emerge. Hence, he could not <gloss target="#t_rpt_1">rpt</gloss> not act
                            in such a way as to give the appearance of favoring one region over
                            another, or one clan over another. This made it essential that he bide
                            his time. I should know that investigations were continuing quietly all
                            the time against the people I had named, and others. If enough evidence
                            appeared, he would act, but meantime, the watchword was prudence and,
                            above all, patience.</p>
                        <p>7. Comment. Though, in parting, <persName corresp="#p_BJ_1"
                                >Bagaza</persName> said that he had enjoyed our conversation because
                            I had made my points strongly and was one of the “rare” ambassadors who
                            told him the truth, he still did not <gloss target="#t_rpt_1"
                                >rpt</gloss> not answer all of my questions directly. He did not
                                <gloss target="#t_rpt_1">rpt</gloss> not disavow the statist
                            tendencies in the regime, whatever the distinction he drew between that
                            and both Marxism and socialism. I feel that he has rather negative
                            feelings about local free enterprise and that he will try to regulate it
                            severely without taking formal measures to halt it. This attitude has
                            already sapped the confidence of local businessmen, and their holding
                            back on new capital investment and inventory buildup will further
                            prejudice the regime against them. On the other hand, <persName
                                corresp="#p_BJ_1">Bagaza</persName> would welcome foreign investment
                            in Burundi by larger scale, more modern enterprises, and this means that
                            if U.S. and other investors ever decide that Burundi nickel is an
                            attractive prospect, <persName corresp="#p_BJ_1">Bagaza</persName> will
                            most probably accept them eagerly.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_BJ_1">Bagaza</persName> also did not respond
                            directly to my queries about the party line that will emerge from the
                            July seminar. However, by his remarks about Simbananiye and the latter’s
                            cohort, Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NE_1"
                            >Nzambimana</persName>, it is clear that he recognizes the efforts of
                            these men to gain a predominant position both personally and politically
                            to his (<persName corresp="#p_BJ_1">Bagaza</persName>’s) disadvantage. I
                            sense that the President is feeling his way to a confrontation, but, at
                            all costs, wishes to avoid a premature showdown. Thus, he really does
                            not <gloss target="#t_rpt_1">rpt</gloss> not know just what political
                            line will emerge a month hence, though he personally favors more
                            moderation.</p>
                        <p>9. About a month ago, rumors spread everywhere in town that <persName
                                corresp="#p_BJ_1">Bagaza</persName> was about to dismiss <persName
                                corresp="#p_NE_1">Nzambimana</persName> and other ministers, but
                            this was later denied and ascribed to an effort by the adherents of the
                            old regime to sow confusion. Father Barakana, the ex-university rector,
                            has told us that the rumors were in fact correct, but that <persName
                                corresp="#p_BJ_1">Bagaza</persName> backed away from his action
                            because it would have been unseemly to act amidst such public
                            speculation. This version rings true, and, if so, it <pb n="383"
                                facs="0415" xml:id="pg_383"/>means that <persName corresp="#p_NE_1"
                                >Nzambimana</persName> is well aware of the critical challenge that
                            he and others of his (Matana) group face from <persName
                                corresp="#p_BJ_1">Bagaza</persName>. Perhaps this is why <persName
                                corresp="#p_NE_1">Nzambimana</persName> is trying to build up his
                            own more radical constituency. For instance, in a speech at the
                            construction site for the Chinese textile plant on June 22, <persName
                                corresp="#p_NE_1">Nzambimana</persName> decried “imperialist”
                            economic aid to Burundi which, unlike Chinese, allegedly tries to block
                            Burundi’s development and to saddle the country with foreign experts
                            indefinitely instead of training native cadres. If <persName
                                corresp="#p_NE_1">Nzambimana</persName> is thus, through his
                            demogogy, trying to make himself into a folk hero and less vulnerable to
                            dismissal by <persName corresp="#p_BJ_1">Bagaza</persName>, we may
                            indeed well be facing a month of fairly critical internal realignment
                            for the future orientation of Burundi’s second republic.</p>

                        <p>Visas for the Bell trainees were routinely issued by our Embassy in
                            Nairobi. Although issuance of such visas is not illegal, we have now
                            initiated a special screening procedure for official Uganda visa
                            applications which would prevent this from happening again.</p>
                        <p>The Anderson Column and recent events related to South Africa will focus
                            Congressional attention once again on Uganda as the Black African State
                            with the most notorious human rights record.</p>
                        <p><pb n="384" facs="0416" xml:id="pg_384"/>I have recently recommended to
                            Commerce that applications to export three Bell helicopters and a used
                            Boeing 707 to Uganda be denied on human rights grounds, and we are
                            exploring the question of restricting “grey area” exports to Uganda as
                            we now do to South Africa. We must expect growing Congressional pressure
                            for stronger measures against Uganda. Three bills recently introduced by
                            Congressman Pease of Ohio and co-sponsored by a broad group of House
                            liberals and conservatives would effectively embargo all US trade with

                            <p>The following steps we have taken should help to mitigate the
                                embarrassment caused us by the discovery that a number of Ugandan
                                police officers are attending helicopter training courses in Forth
                                Worth, Texas, under the auspices of the Bell Helicopter Textron
                                company, which sold 9 civilian model helicopters to the Ugandan
                                police before we closed our Embassy in 1973:</p>
                            <p>—Prior to the furor over the training, the Secretary recommended to
                                the Department of Commerce that it deny applications for export
                                licenses for three new helicopters and one used Boeing 707 destined
                                for Uganda, since these items would be likely to be used in support
                                of the regime’s violations of human rights. Commerce has accepted
                                this recommendation and Bell has indicated it will not fight the
                                decision.</p>
                            <p>—We have instructed all diplomatic and consular posts to refer to the
                                Department for advisory opinions all visa applications by Ugandan
                                officials and anyone else traveling on Ugandan Government

                                Ugandans to the US which we would deem to be incompatible with our
                                human rights policy (e.g., police helicopter pilots).</p>
                            <p>—We have denied entry into the US of two additional Ugandan
                                helicopter trainees who were issued visas with the rest of the group
                                    <pb n="386" facs="0418" xml:id="pg_386"/>but had not yet arrived
                                in this country when we learned of the program. We have also revoked
                                the visas of two other trainees who have not yet arrived.</p>
                            <p>—We are actively considering asking Bell Helicopter and/or the
                                Ugandans to terminate the training before its scheduled end (which
                                for most of the trainees will be December 16, although for some the
                                training may continue until toward the end of January).</p>
                            <p>Official action to terminate the training is an option open to us: we
                                could revoke the visas as “prejudicial to the public interest” under
                                Section 212 (a) (27) of the Immigration and Nationality Act and
                                request the trainees to leave the country. However, if they refused
                                to leave, our legal grounds for expelling them would be shaky: that
                                section of the law has never been used to revoke a visa and expel an
                                alien after his admission to this country.</p>

                                Congressional action against Uganda. He has introduced three basic
                                bills which would, respectively, ban imports of Ugandan coffee, ban
                                all Ugandan imports and ban all US exports to Uganda. He is also
                                considering introducing a resolution calling for the closure of the
                                Ugandan Embassy in Washington. He has succeeded in obtaining
                                significant liberal and conservative co-sponsorship. Observers of
                                the Congressional scene report that anti-Uganda sentiment on the
                                Hill is so widespread that the Pease measures would pass

                                    South Africa. The resolution was not adopted due to negative
                                    votes by permanent members of the Security Council, including
                                    the United States. (<hi rend="italic">Yearbook of the United

                                that such measures are of dubious effectiveness, given the
                                likelihood that Uganda can find other trading partners to replace
                                us, and that in any case such actions of ours are unlikely to
                                rectify the human rights situation in Uganda.</p>
                            <p>Congressman Pease acknowledges these arguments. He nonetheless sees
                                value in disassociating the US completely from the <persName
                                    corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName> regime and feels that its
                                human rights record is so unrelievedly egregious as to minimize the
                                possibility that actions against Uganda will be precedent-setting.
                                He also feels that if trade measures could be instituted to slow or
                                halt the flow of goods which buys the loyalty of <persName
                                    corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName>’s soldiers, this could lead
                                to <persName corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName>’s overthrow (though
                                he admits that <persName corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName>’s
                                immediate successor may be no improvement). In his opinion, the US
                                should take the lead on this and seek cooperation from Uganda’s
                                other trade partners. Pease accepts our view that the existence of
                                the Uganda Embassy in Washington was extremely useful to us for
                                direct access to <persName corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName> during
                                the February crisis and could fill this role again. However, he is
                                concerned that allowing the Embassy to operate confers some degree
                                of respectability on the <persName corresp="#p_AID_1"
                                    >Amin</persName> regime and he wonders if the need for direct
                                access could not be achieved through the Uganda Mission to the

                            contingency plans for a possible Ugandan crisis. The meeting reviewed
                            the situation, and set up a Task Force to produce a contingency plan on
                            an accelerated basis, but this will take at least a week.<note n="2"

                                help from the West German Embassy, requesting assistance from other

                        <p>The point of this memo is that the general consensus of the meeting was
                            that the United States at the moment has no contingency plan for dealing
                            with the situation where <persName corresp="#p_AID_1">Idi
                                Amin</persName> decides to, for whatever reason, hold some or all of
                            the 240 American citizens in Uganda hostage in response to one of
                            several kinds of events, including US action. Such a crisis does not at
                            the moment exist, but it could arise very fast.</p>
                        <p>The meeting reviewed various factors:</p>
                        <p>—the widely dispersed nature of the Americans throughout Uganda and the
                            difficulty in communicating with them;</p>
                        <p>—the apparent lassitude of the West Germans in ascertaining their exact
                            circumstances;</p>
                        <p>—a review of the February Ugandan crisis, concluding that we resolved
                            that crisis as much through luck as skill and that the same tactics may
                            not work the second time around;<note n="4" xml:id="d147fn4">See <ref
                                    target="#d138">Documents 138</ref> and <ref target="#d139"

                        <p>—decided to set up an interagency task force on a priority basis,
                            coordinated by State, to develop a set of tactical crisis options

                            military, and psychological strategies for the President;</p>
                        <p>—the probability that any military option would be a very messy one.</p>
                        <p>I felt very keenly as the meeting wore on, the lack of basis for
                            intelligent choices that could at this moment be put before the
                            President, and therefore stressed the need to move both quickly and
                            confidentially. (It was remembered that in February <persName
                                corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName> offered to come over and join our
                            task force!)</p>
                        <p>There was general sentiment that a number of factors could trigger a
                            crisis, and until the most intelligent tactical options possible were
                            presented to the President, we should avoid situations and words which
                            might trigger <persName corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName>’s anger. I
                            concur strongly in this recommendation.</p>
                        <p>I, in conjunction with <persName corresp="#p_MRM_1">Dick
                            Moose</persName>, will push State and the Task Force to produce these
                            options for the President as soon as possible. In the meantime, State
                            will take actions to upgrade our information, and will specifically

                            acts while our Uganda crisis policy is in an embryonic stage. This task
                            will be made somewhat easier by the upcoming Congressional recess, at
                            the end of which we will presumably have both a tactical and a general
                            policy. The sentiment at today’s meeting was that somewhat higher than
                            working level approaches to Congress might be necessary.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>We have now completed our overall review of the elements of our
                            relationship with Uganda and the policy options available to us.<note
                                n="2" xml:id="d148fn2">See <ref target="#d147">Document
                                147</ref>.</note> The Secretary has concluded that our policy should
                            be one of consciously distancing the U.S. from Ugandan human rights
                            violations and encouraging international action on Uganda, while not
                            going so far as to sever all U.S. contact with Uganda.</p>
                        <p>The major specific elements of our policy are as follows:</p>
                        <p>—We will not grant visas to Ugandans who appear to have been involved in
                            human rights violations, and we will not grant visas for
                            security-related training or for other training which would directly
                            benefit the regime’s repressive apparatus.</p>
                        <p>—We will continue to prohibit munitions-list exports, and in cooperation
                            with the Commerce Department will deny licenses for “gray area” items
                            (such as shot guns and crime control equipment, and including
                            helicopters and other light aircraft).</p>
                        <p>—We will also review all other major exports to Uganda from the human
                            rights perspective. We plan to continue to deny commercial aircraft
                            sales, since Uganda’s commercial aviation fleet is at present primarily
                            used for the direct supply and support of the regime and its security
                            apparatus. Other items will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.</p>
                        <p>—We will continue to remind American firms of Uganda’s egregious human
                            rights record and will signal the public relations problems of doing
                            business with Uganda, but (except in cases requiring licensing) we will
                            make clear to American firms considering doing business with Uganda that
                            they must make their own decisions on this subject in light of all the
                            considerations involved.</p>
                        <p>—We will continue strongly to discourage Americans from traveling to
                            Uganda for any purpose (including business), and will continue to advise
                            the remaining 200-plus American residents to leave.</p>
                        <p><pb n="392" facs="0424" xml:id="pg_392"/>—We will play an active role in
                            international discussions of Uganda’s human rights situation and will
                            support resolutions and investigations by the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss> Human Rights Commission and other bodies; our focus will
                            be on building an international consensus, and we will closely
                            coordinate our efforts with those of other concerned governments in the
                            interest of maximum effectiveness.</p>
                        <p>—We will reinforce our present policy of providing humanitarian
                            assistance to Ugandan refugees, both through contributions to the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> High Commissioner for Refugees and
                            through special assistance (such as in the education field) where
                            particular needs are identified.</p>
                        <p>However, at the same time we will not take certain steps advocated by
                            some critics of Uganda, including a number of members of Congress:</p>
                        <p>—We will not break relations with Uganda, close the Ugandan Embassy in
                            Washington, or restrict the movement of Ugandan diplomats at the United
                            Nations. We will, however, monitor closely and investigate any
                            information received on improper activities by Ugandan personnel in this
                            country (including harassment of exiles) and will take up with the
                            Ugandans any cases where there is substantial evidence of such improper
                            activities.</p>
                        <p>—We will not support the legislation proposed by Congressman Pease for
                            embargoes of U.S. imports from and exports to Uganda, legislation which
                            would establish difficult precedents for our international trade policy
                            and would stimulate pressure for similar sanctions against other
                            countries with human rights problems. Instead, we will respond to the
                            strong pressures in Congress for action on Uganda in the coming session
                            by working with interested members and committees to develop an
                            acceptable vehicle for Congressional action based on the elements of our
                            policy previously described. A likely approach would be through a
                            resolution similar to the Collins resolution on South Africa.<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d148fn3">The Collins amendment to House Concurrent
                                Resolution 388, introduced on October 26, denounced South Africa for
                                the September 12 death of Steve Biko while under detention in South
                                Africa and for the October 19 banning of anti-apartheid individuals
                                and groups. It also urged the President to take measures against
                                South Africa to register the deep concern of the U.S. public about
                                the continued violation of human rights in South Africa.</note> We
                            are cautiously optimistic that such an approach can succeed, but success
                            is by no means guaranteed, particularly since there is substantial
                            Congressional support for the Pease boycott bills.</p>
                        <p>We cannot discount the possibility of retaliation against the Americans
                            resident in Uganda. Accordingly, we are continuing to work on
                            contingency planning for the protection and/or evacuation of those
                            Americans should such retaliation occur or should the situation
                            otherwise deteriorate. A team representing the Departments of State and

                            all Americans in Uganda to depart the country. We have also encouraged
                            several interested Congressmen and their staffs to discuss with the

                        <p>Before the President entered the Cabinet Room, Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> started the discussion off
                            by noting that the US is very preoccupied with the maintenance of the
                            principle of territorial integrity, not only in the Horn of Africa but
                            elsewhere. The US is very conscious of the closeness of its relationship
                            with Kenya, and in consequence of its closeness to Kenya, the US is very
                            concerned for Kenya’s security.</p>
                        <p>Vice President Moi said that Kenya felt the same concern as the United
                            States does over the Horn of Africa. The situation requires urgent
                            attention. The conflict must be removed. Kenya feels that major powers
                            should not be involved there, and Kenya therefore appreciates the US
                            position of staying out of the conflict. Territorial integrity is a
                            priority concern. If that principle comes apart, it could cause chaos in
                            Africa. Kenya has concentrated on economic development up to now. But
                            the world is unpredictable. Kenya sent this delegation to make the US
                            Government understand Kenya’s problems. People may misunderstand Kenya
                            from hearsay or from reading newspaper accounts. But the fact is that
                            Kenya’s concern is real and that is why President Kenyatta has asked the
                            delegation to come to the US.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> said that the US
                            needed to consult with Kenya on these problems and needs Kenya’s
                            guidance. He noted that Kenya is much closer to the problem and we are
                            of course close friends who share the same values about growth,
                            development, political organization, etc. He hoped that Kenya has noted
                            a change in US policies toward Africa under this Administration. We are
                            against the involvement of outside powers in African problems. We have
                            made clear our support in southern Africa for majority rule. We have
                            also made clear our support for the principle of territorial integrity.
                            This is the thrust of US policy.</p>
                        <p>In that context, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>
                            said the US is concerned about the Horn and wished to fashion a response
                            that will improve the prospects for a peaceful settlement. In that
                            context, he wished to make three points:</p>
                        <p>1. The US does not approve the Somali aggression. Somalia should withdraw
                            from the Ogaden and should not pose a threat to any of its <pb n="395"
                                facs="0427" xml:id="pg_395"/>neighbors. We will not provide the
                            means for them to make or carry out such threats.</p>
                        <p>2. There must be some African arrangement to ensure that the Somalis have
                            confidence that there will not be any retribution against the Ogaden
                            population if they withdraw. Such an arrangement would also ensure that
                            Somalia’s territorial integrity would not be violated.</p>
                        <p>3. There must be an arrangement for the removal of foreign troops. The
                            Soviets and Cubans went there to protect the territorial integrity of
                            Ethiopia. Once that threat is gone, they should go also. We fear that
                            their presence there could be the beginning of military and political
                            involvement in the area and in African problems which should be a cause
                            of concern to Africans themselves. He stressed that foreign incursion in
                            the Horn breeds foreign counter-incursion.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Kibaki said that Kenya agrees with Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1"
                                >Brzezinski</persName> entirely. Those objectives are also Kenya’s
                            objectives. It is most important to realize that the reason why there
                            has been foreign incursion is the pursuit by Somalia of something
                            fundamental to Somali life which they have been undertaking with Soviet
                            help: Greater Somalia. That is the fundamental issue. If the Somalis do
                            not abandon the goal of a Greater Somalia, withdrawal will mean nothing.
                            It will simply represent a pause before they start to pursue Greater
                            Somalia again. For that abandonment by them they may have some need for
                            foreign assistance. But the US and the West must think of the demand
                            side: Why did the Soviets get invited in?</p>
                        <p>At this point in the conversation the President entered the room and
                            shook hands with all the Kenyan guests. He then said that he was honored
                            to have the delegation here from Kenya which is a great country and a
                            great friend of the United States. He asked Vice President Moi to
                            express his pleasure and his admiration to President Kenyatta and also
                            to pass along his hopes that President Kenyatta would have a long and
                            fruitful life.</p>
                        <p>The President then said that he would like to say that the US shares
                            Kenya’s deep concern about the deteriorating situation in the Horn of
                            Africa. The US shares Kenyan concern about violations of territorial
                            integrity. While it may well be that boundaries in Africa were drawn
                            without very good reason, nonetheless we must now stick with them.</p>
                        <p>The President said that the US is concerned at the fact that the Soviets
                            first overarmed the Somalis, which precipitated the invasion of
                            Ethiopia, and now they are pouring arms into Ethiopia. We have talked to
                            President Siad and have impressed upon him the importance of withdrawing
                            from the Ogaden. On the other hand, we have a commitment from <persName
                                corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName> and from the Soviets not to
                            cross the border into Somalia. We are concerned about Kenya’s security.
                            Evidence of that is the fact that the first F–5’s are about to arrive.
                            We are working <pb n="396" facs="0428" xml:id="pg_396"/>to improve
                            Kenya’s security with other Western powers who share our view of Kenya’s
                            importance.</p>
                        <p>The US feels that Kenya has taken the right course in not investing in
                            weapons, but instead putting its resources into meeting the needs of the
                            people.</p>
                        <p>The President hoped that in the coming months there might be a lessening
                            of tension between Kenya and Somalia. It would be much easier for us to
                            use our influence if there were a drop in the level of harsh language
                            used between the two countries. He hoped that in conveying his words to
                            President Kenyatta that Vice President Moi would also express his
                            admiration for Kenya’s great leader. (At this point Vice President Moi
                            handed over a letter from Kenyatta to President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>.)<note n="2" xml:id="d149fn2"
                                >The January 27 letter from Kenyatta to <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                    >Carter</persName> expressed hope for a new security
                                understanding between Kenya and the United States. (Carter Library,
                                National Security Affairs, Brzezinski Material, President’s
                                Correspondence with Foreign Leaders File, Box 11, Kenya: President
                                Mzee Jomo Kenyatta 1/77–3/78)</note> The President remarked that
                            President Kenyatta had certainly sent a superb delegation. We are
                            honored by the quality of the delegation and by the fact that it
                            represents such a considerable portion of the leadership of Kenya.</p>
                        <p>Vice President Moi said that President Kenyatta had sent him with a very
                            important message. Having concentrated its efforts on economic
                            development, Kenya now finds that the time has come for it to safeguard
                            its security. There are three areas of importance to Kenya: political,
                            military, and economic. On the political side, Kenya knows that the
                            interests of the United States and Kenya are identical: containment of
                            communism in the Horn of Africa and protection of the sea lanes and
                            safeguarding the sources of petroleum. These matters are vital to East
                            Africa and especially to Kenya. When goods had to go around the Cape,
                            Kenya had to pay much more. Kenya wants the United States to understand
                            Kenya. Kenya does not wish to get arms. The possession of arms does not
                            contribute to a better standard of living for the people. For a long
                            time President Kenyatta held that view, but now he feels the time has
                            come to seek help from Kenya’s friends and that means the United States,
                            our close friend. When Kenya needs help, we come to you.</p>
                        <p>As for the political aspect, Kenya itself does not dispute any borders.
                            But Somalia has enshrined a Greater Somalia in its constitution and now
                            they are embarked on achieving it. Kenya has put a great deal of
                            development effort into the Northeast Province, such things as schools
                            and hospitals. Kenya shares nothing in the way of ideology with
                            Ethiopia. The only thing that Kenya shares with Ethiopia is a devotion
                            to the principle of territorial integrity. That question is vital <pb
                                n="397" facs="0429" xml:id="pg_397"/>to Kenya. Kenya loathes the
                            presence of Soviets in Ethiopia. Kenya feels that withdrawal of the
                            Somali forces from the Ogaden would leave the Soviets with no excuse for
                            staying, but as long as the fighting continues the Soviets do have an
                            excuse to stay: protection of Ethiopia’s territorial integrity. If the
                            Somalis withdraw, then Kenya feels that all of us can call for Soviet
                            and Cuban forces to withdraw as well. He said that Kenya felt that the
                            United States had made the right move in sending a special emissary to
                            Ethiopia.</p>
                        <p>Vice President Moi said that the delegation has come to request the US to
                            help on a number of items. They are asking the minimum to defend Kenya’s
                            borders. Kenya has no desire to become a military power. However, they
                            face the threat from Somalia and they also face a future threat from the
                            Marxist regime in Ethiopia. It makes no sense to wait until the end and
                            then ask for help. This has led many African countries to panic and seek
                            help anywhere it was available.</p>
                        <p>Moi said that President Kenyatta places high hopes on the success of this
                            mission. He has already been telephoning Vice President Moi to find out
                            what progress has been made. Vice President Moi hoped that the President
                            would consider very sympathetically Kenya’s request. Kenya has threats
                            from Uganda, Tanzania, Somalia and Ethiopia. The only peaceful neighbor
                            it has is Sudan. He stressed the strategic importance of Kenya.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> said that he had
                            to go to make an appearance on television. He said that he had already
                            had a very good briefing from Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VC_1"
                                >Vance</persName> on his meeting with the delegation the previous

                            extensively with Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>
                            and he will be talking to both men this afternoon. He expressed his
                            appreciation for the delegation’s coming to Washington. He noted that
                            the US shares a number of principles with Kenya and the US is indeed
                            concerned over Kenya’s security situation. We share Kenya’s feeling that
                            you must be able to defend yourself. He said he would be awaiting a
                            recommendation from the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State
                            on which to base a decision, but he assured the delegation that he would
                            give their request very sympathetic consideration.<note n="4"

                            He said that an attack on Kenya would be very dangerous for the United
                            States as well. He agreed to study their request and their military
                            needs as <pb n="398" facs="0430" xml:id="pg_398"/>well as the assessment

                            and the capacity and needs of its Armed Forces to meet these threats.
                            The Team, representing all military departments, <gloss
                                target="#t_OJCS_1">OJCS</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_OSD_1"
                                >OSD</gloss>, European Command, The State Department, and US Embassy
                            (Nairobi), conducted the survey of Kenyan Armed Forces, during the
                            period 18 March–5 April.</p>
                        <p>2. (C) Our preliminary findings are as follows:</p>
                        <p>a. Intelligence.</p>
                        <p>(1) Somalia presents the principal threat to Kenya; tentatively, Somalia
                            has the capability to launch several brigades, with the total strength
                            of a division sized force with limited air and naval support, against
                            Kenya’s Armed Forces. In addition, there is present in Uganda a force
                            sufficient to launch attacks against Kenya in brigade strength. Our best
                            estimate is that Somalia and Uganda will be in a position to launch such
                            attacks within 0 to two years. Over the longer-term of three to five
                            years, a combination of Soviet-Armed Ethiopian or Tanzanian Forces,
                            assisted by Cuban Surrogates, would be in a position to launch attacks
                            of corps-level strength against Kenya. During the next five <pb n="399"
                                facs="0431" xml:id="pg_399"/>years, in conjunction with a
                            Somali-Ugandan or Ethiopian-Tanzanian attack, insurgency by the Somali
                            population of Northeast Kenya is probable.</p>
                        <p>(2) Analysis of terrain discloses the following key points:</p>
                        <p>(a) There is sufficient space between the borders and key areas to trade
                            space for time except opposite Uganda and Tanzania in the Mombassa port
                            area.</p>
                        <p>(b) The terrain opposite Somalia favors the attacker, with unobstructed
                            mobility and poor defensive fields of fire due to brush, which will make
                            ground-fired wire guided missiles ineffective and limit tank main gun
                            effectiveness.</p>
                        <p>b. The Kenyan Armed Forces presently have negligible capabilities to
                            counter the above hostile capabilities. The ground forces are
                            essentially infantry with no antitank defense or air defense means. Some
                            tanks and artillery, on order from Great Britain, will not significantly
                            affect the deficiency in the antitank means, since the equipment on
                            order could not be effectively operated in the terrain facing Somalia.
                            The Air Force is based on obsolete combat and training aircraft with
                            extremely low operational readiness rates. Air support and airlift
                            aircraft, although more advanced, are limited and small.</p>
                        <p>The incoming squadron of F–5E’s represent a considerable improvement as a
                            general purpose fighter, however the lack of an adequate ground
                            environment (radar, commo, etc.), reduces the capability. The Navy
                            consists of seven patrol boats, three of which are obsolete and in
                            questionable material condition. All vessels are lightly armed,
                            short-ranged, weather limited coastal craft. Plans to improve weapons
                            capability by installing GABRIEL surface-to-surface missile systems have
                            been approved for two craft commencing in March 1979. The other two
                            ships of this class are expected to receive the SSM conversion at a
                            later date. The Armed Forces major asset is a well educated and
                            disciplined enlisted man who compares favorably with US enlisted
                            personnel. The officer corps, on the other hand, particularly at the
                            higher level, is not well-grounded professionally.</p>
                        <p>3. (S) The Survey Team is developing alternative
                            equipment-training-logistics packages which will augment existing third
                            country programs. The Team approach will involve low, middle, and high
                            cost force improvement packages that are balanced, integrated and
                            time-phased. These will be based on a one-year (quick fix), a two-to
                            four-year period, and an out-year period. The alternative packages will
                            include capital investment costs and increased operating costs
                            associated with force improvement, together with an assessment of the
                            likely impact of these increased costs on the Kenyan economy.</p>
                        <p>All three alternatives, (force packages) will consider the present
                            equipment on hand and equipment on order from third country <pb n="400"
                                facs="0432" xml:id="pg_400"/>nations. Primary emphasis will be
                            placed on avoiding the mixing of similar typed equipment from two or
                            more nations. As an example. the Kenyans are programmed to receive the
                            British Vickers tank (105mm main gun) commencing March 1979. This weapon
                            system provides an adequate armor capability and US tanks will not be
                            recommended as they would complicate the equipment mix. Also, the
                            Kenyans are procurring the United Kingdom’s new 105mm light gun (total
                            of 18) with a maximum range of 17,000 meters. This gun adequately
                            fulfills the immediate field artillery requirement, negating the
                            purchasing of US Howitzers. Similarly, equipment alternatives will be
                            considered to provide the required capability, such as using either
                                <gloss target="#t_TOW_1">TOW</gloss> or HOT missiles to counter the
                            armor threats.</p>
                        <p>In addition, the report will identify actions which the Government of
                            Kenya can initiate to improve the capabilities of its Armed Forces,
                            regardless of the type or quantity of new equipment it decides to
                            procure. These include providing dispersal facilities for fighters,
                            constructing taxi ways to enhance the efficiency of fighter bases,
                            bolstering logistic systems, and correcting deficiencies in the officer
                            training program.</p>
                        <p>No overall cost estimates are presently calculated, however, it is
                            estimated that the initial costs will be low, with emphasis on reform of
                            support systems and integration of equipment on order.</p>
                        <p>4. (S) Additional factors that bear on US policy are:</p>
                        <p>a. The Kenyans are experiencing serious difficulties with the British
                            military supply system due to the obsolescence of equipment provided and
                            inadequate logistics backup for available equipment. The Kenyans are
                            developing a close tie with Israel, who is training Kenyan technicians
                            and supplying some key items.</p>
                        <p>b. The Kenyan political and senior military leadership has provided only
                            partial policy direction, inspiration, and management control. This
                            deficiency adversely affects the professionalism and ability of the
                            Armed Forces to develop the organization and human resources necessary
                            to effectively transition to modern equipment.</p>
                        <p>c. The physical infirmities of President Kenyatta make the question of
                            political succession a key issue at this time. There is significant
                            dissatisfaction among junior officers which could be an important factor
                            in the post-Kenyatta period should a struggle for power among various
                            contenders prove destabilizing.</p>
                        <p>d. However, the overall potential of the country is promising. Kenya
                            possesses a capable, educated population, a soundly developing economy,
                            and a significant young leadership with strong nationalistic
                            motivation.</p>
                        <p>5. (U) An overview of preliminary findings, to include those items that
                            the Kenyans must do for themselves, were presented to members <pb

                            <persName corresp="#p_VC_1">Vance</persName> said that State has said
                            that it would. Sayre Stevens said that Ethiopia has the <gloss
                                target="#t_TOW_1">TOW</gloss>. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1"
                                >Brzezinski</persName> said that we should grant the exception but
                            point out that others in the area may have a similar capability. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_SRP_1">Smith</persName> asked whether PD–13
                            implied that we could not supply a country to respond to an increased
                            threat. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VC_1">Vance</persName> said
                            grant the exception but footnote it as stated by Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>.</p>
                        <p>On the second question, of whether <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss>
                            credit might be reprogrammed, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VC_1"
                                >Vance</persName> pointed out that the Kenyans will have $6.0
                            million in FY 1979. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1"
                                >Brzezinski</persName> pointed out that the President had said we
                            would help and asked if there were other countries we might look at. He
                            suggested Jordan. <persName corresp="#p_VC_1">Vance</persName> said he
                            thought Jordan would not be appropriate since we may need Jordan’s help
                            in the near future, and suggested we provide the credit in FY 1980.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DCW_1">Charles Duncan</persName> said that we
                            really need to help Kenya now, and was it not possible to find $10
                            million? Jim McIntyre said that he was concerned about our promising
                            assistance in future budget years and suggested we look at FY 1978 and
                            1979. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> suggested
                            that the working group review the situation in time to consider the
                            question at the Monday <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss> meeting. He
                            also stressed the importance of providing the assistance teams and that
                            they should also be part of the discussion on Monday. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCW_1">Duncan</persName> said that if we just present
                            the report to the Kenyans without additional commitments, our response
                            will be viewed as insufficient. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VC_1"
                                >Vance</persName> said that we would delay presenting the report
                            until we have had a chance to review the credit question.</p>
                        <p>The meeting adjourned at 5:30 p.m.</p>

                                The survey team produced a full report on April 28. (Washington

                            ambitious $1 billion ten year program requiring up to 50% of Kenya’s
                            foreign exchange earnings during the period and the proposed US response
                            which would assist in providing less than five percent of the program
                            during the first three years. Defense maintained that the report is a
                            credible assessment of the threat to Kenya and that since it calls for a
                            phased response to Kenya’s needs and the participation of other
                            suppliers, the Kenyans would not view our initial <pb n="404"
                                facs="0436" xml:id="pg_404"/>modest response as inadequate. The
                                <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> felt that the report would not
                            make the Kenyans psychologically dependent on the US. The Kenyans view
                            the report as a professional analysis of their military needs. <gloss
                                target="#t_ACDA_1">ACDA</gloss> added that the Kenyans could be
                            counted on to make a realistic evaluation of the threat. State viewed
                            the report as a realistic assessment of Kenyan needs and that it was
                            worthwhile for the US to offer them the limited package dictated by
                            available resources. There was agreement that the survey team chief
                            would return to Kenya and present the report.<note n="3"

                            He would indicate US willingness to provide assistance teams and bring
                            back any Kenyan request for equipment.</p>
                        <p>Next, the <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss> turned to financing. The
                            most urgent priority contained in the report is the 32 helicopters
                            equipped with <gloss target="#t_TOW_1">TOW</gloss> anti-tank missiles
                            costing $44 million. The only immediate source of funds is the
                            reprogramming of FY ’78 and ’79 <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss>
                            credit. Because it is not possible to find the full $44 million in FY
                            ’78 and ’79, US approval of the sale would necessarily imply that Kenya
                            must finance a part of the total cost. Defense and State maintained that
                            it would be militarily unsound to offer fewer helicopters. Also, because
                            of the uncertainties associated with the FY ’79 <gloss target="#t_FMS_1"
                                >FMS</gloss> credit request, reprogramming should focus only on FY
                            ’78. State offered the $10 million previously identified for Somalia
                            (Taiwan $5, Indonesia $2, Thailand $1, Morocco $1, and Jordan $1) plus
                            $2 million additional from Jordan. <persName corresp="#p_AD_1"
                                >Aaron</persName> pointed out that the donor countries involved have
                            not yet been notified of that previous decision. He questioned the
                            wisdom of taking funds which were identified in response to one set of
                            circumstances and applying them to a different situation. He registered
                            the <gloss target="#t_VP_1">VP</gloss>’s concern over the possible
                            impact of cuts to Indonesia and Thailand. Defense added that the cuts to
                            Jordan would send an appropriate message. State felt that Morocco should
                            not receive further cuts. There was agreement that it was not necessary
                            to make the final decision at this meeting on where the cuts would take
                            place. The exact donors would be identified closer to the end of the
                            fiscal year when it became clearer as to which <gloss target="#t_FMS_1"
                                >FMS</gloss> credit agreements might not be signed in FY ’78. For FY
                            ’79, the Kenyans are programmed to receive $6 million in credit which is
                            not yet committed. Because of possible cuts in the FY ’79 appropriation,
                            it might not be possible to find more. There was also agreement to view
                            Kenya sympathetically during the FY ’80 budget cycle. The survey team
                            chief was directed not to disappoint the Kenyans by calling attention to
                            the <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> credit problem, but to indicate
                            that $12 million would be reprogrammed in FY ’78.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_HJG_1">Hill</persName>, the survey team chief,
                            accompanied me. The discussion focused mainly on the question of US
                            responsiveness to Kenya—were we considering enough assistance and
                            financial help for Kenya in view of the survey report’s recommendations
                            and Kenyan expectations?</p>
                        <p>There was general agreement that <gloss target="#t_MGen_1">MGen</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_HJG_1">Hill</persName> should be allowed to return

                        <p>• <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> participation in the first phase
                            of Kenya’s defense modernization program.</p>
                        <p>• the helicopter/<gloss target="#t_TOW_1">TOW</gloss> system, subject to

                        <p>• the logistics, training and personnel teams.</p>
                        <p>• the reallocation of $12M in FY 78 <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss>
                            financing to enable the <gloss target="#t_GOK_1">GOK</gloss> to initiate
                            the helicopter program, and indications that we will consider additional

                            (without making a commitment).</p>
                        <p>• our expectation that the Kenyans would share the financial burden since

                            which we can make available.</p>
                        <p>Subsequently, on July 18, 1978 <gloss target="#t_MGen_1">MGen</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_HJG_1">Hill</persName> presented the survey report
                            to the Kenyan Ministry of Defense (<gloss target="#t_MOD_1"
                            >MOD</gloss>). Overall, the Kenyans were pleased with the
                            professionalism of the report and intend to use it as a comprehensive
                            strategic objectives plan. Conversely, they expressed some concern about
                            the following:</p>
                        <p>• the lack of immediate US support—both equipment and money—and the lack
                            of firm, multi-year funding.</p>
                        <p><pb n="406" facs="0438" xml:id="pg_406"/>• the limited amount of

                            provide in comparison with the magnitude of the overall military
                            modernization program outlined in the survey report.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">CONCLUSION</hi>. The Kenyans decided to defer a
                            decision on procurement of those items mentioned in the report until the
                            report has been reviewed by the Kenyan <gloss target="#t_MOD_1"
                                >MOD</gloss> and Ministry of Finance. Meanwhile, they intend to
                            proceed with high level military visits to the UK, <gloss

                        <p><hi rend="italic">OUTLOOK</hi>. According to <gloss target="#t_MGen_1"
                                >MGen</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_HJG_1">Hill</persName>, the Kenyans are likely to
                            agree to the modernization program, and will probably request US
                            assistance in those areas where we have shown an interest, i.e., air
                            superiority, logistics, personnel, training and air cavalry. We can
                            expect to receive a request for the 32 Hughes helicopters/<gloss
                                target="#t_TOW_1">TOW</gloss> package in the near future.
                            Additionally, the Kenyans are acutely aware of their immediate
                            logistics, personnel and training problems and may seek US help in
                            correcting them.</p>
                        <p>Whether or not we increase our security assistance to Kenya, our
                            Ambassador in Nairobi has asked that we establish an Office of Defense
                            Cooperation within the Embassy sometime in FY 79. We are taking steps to
                            implement his request.</p>

                            from Uganda are coffee. The amendment exempts our agricultural exports,
                            and we export little else to Uganda. Earlier, the House approved 377 to
                            0 a similar, though non-binding, resolution. We expect the bill to go to
                            Conference this week. The Conference will take no more than a few days,
                            and the bill should be on your desk in 2 to 3 weeks.<note n="2"

                        <p>It is possible (some would say probable) that <persName
                                corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName> will react violently to the
                            imposition of the embargo. He may threaten to, or actually, retaliate
                            against the 200-odd Americans in Uganda. If he does, our ability to
                            rescue Americans, who are scattered throughout the country, is quite
                            limited.</p>
                        <p>Our choices are limited. They are:</p>
                        <p>1. Not to oppose the amendment openly in Conference, but privately warn
                            the conferees that you think the amendment is ill-advised because it
                            jeopardizes American lives. We cannot win, and action opposing it would
                            cast doubt about your dedication to a human rights policy. (State and
                            White House Congressional Liaison are in agreement on this.)</p>
                        <p>2. Couple private warnings with public statements expressing the hope
                            that the situation in Uganda will improve and that the embargo is
                            ill-advised. (Treasury would favor this approach because they are
                            generally opposed to economic embargoes for political reasons.)</p>
                        <p>Making a protest for the record would lay the ground work for a signing
                            statement which would point out that this is an example of the problems
                            posed by Congressional interference in the day-to-day operation of
                            foreign policy.</p>
                        <p>3. Of course, you could veto the bill. I would, however, strongly
                            recommend against it because it might be misinterpreted as a defense of
                                <persName corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName> and would certainly be
                            overridden. In addition, a veto would be detrimental from the point of
                            view of the <gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss>. If you are inclined to
                            veto it, we should know now so that we can begin to establish a record
                            which would clearly explain your reasons for doing so.</p>

                            service.</p>
                        <p>3. Moi stressed long and close friendship with US predating independence
                            (Justice Marshall was evidence of this having helped Kenyan delegation
                            to Lancaster House conference in 1961) and his commitment to continue
                            Kenyatta’s domestic and foreign policies. Moi stressed his respect for
                            Kenyan Constitution, an independent judiciary and his firm commitment to
                            uphold individual freedoms of Kenyans. Justice Marshall picked up on
                            this theme, saying Kenya and late President Kenyatta merited particular
                            respect for constitutional democracy as Kenya “had not bent its
                            constitution” as had so many other governments. Marshall added that
                            democracy was cumbersome, but best system he knew despite its many
                            shortcomings, commenting it was better to plod ahead with reason than
                            “to kill someone and then be sorry.”</p>
                        <p>4. President Moi requested press to leave room, after which he explained
                            Kenya’s desire to live in peace with neighbors and have border
                            respected. President claimed there were some 10,000 Somali military in
                            civilian clothes fighting in Ogaden and requested our assistance in
                            putting pressure on Siad to desist and respect the territorial <pb
                                n="410" facs="0442" xml:id="pg_410"/>integrity of all its neighbors.
                            He said the situation in Djibouti seemed all right at present, as French
                            presence there has deterred Siad from any aggressive action. He added
                            that <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName> was very much
                            afraid of Arab support for Somalia. At this point, Assistant Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MRM_1">Moose</persName> informed Moi that our
                            dialogue with Siad was premised on condition that Somalia live in peace
                            with her neighbors and that we will continue to push this objective and
                            keep Kenyan interests in mind as we proceed. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_YA_1">Young</persName> added that it was preferable that
                            we have some relationship with Siad so that he has an alternative to the
                            Soviets. Moi responded that Kenya has no problem with a US-Somali
                            relationship, as <gloss target="#t_GOK_1">GOK</gloss> sees us as
                            moderating influence on Siad.</p>
                        <p>5. At this juncture, Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MRM_1"
                                >Moose</persName> spoke of our desire to better relations with
                            Ethiopia which he characterized as currently marked by suspicion and
                            misunderstanding. He said that while we certainly do not agree with
                            everything the <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName> regime
                            is doing and are particularly distressed over the human rights situation
                            in Ethiopia, we recognize the need for basic reforms and are willing to
                            approach our relationship with Ethiopia with an open mind. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRM_1">Moose</persName> then explained particular

                            PMAC re this issue. Moi responded that he had already mentioned US
                            desire for improvement of relations “to Ethiopian number two” (Capt.
                            Fikre-Selassie Wodgeress, who headed Ethiopian delegation to Kenyatta
                            funeral), on previous day as follow-up to talks he had had in Washington
                            during visit this past winter, although he did not elaborate on
                            precisely what he told Ethiopian delegation. <gloss target="#t_FonMin_1"
                                >FonMin</gloss> Waiyaki then proposed we make pitch to Ethiopian
                            Foreign Minister, whom he said was “reasonable man,” at upcoming <gloss

                        <p>6. Moi then thanked <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> for economic
                            assistance, adding he expected to see Ambassador in coming days on this
                            issue. At this point MinState Koinange said it was most important to get
                            message to US so that Kenya would be able to cope “with problems here.”
                            While Koinange did not mention military assistance as such, it was
                            assumed this is what he had in mind. Justice Marshall replied that the
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> would do all it could to help
                            Kenya, implying <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> did not have a free
                            hand given congressional role which Congressman Diggs had earlier
                            described in some detail. As meeting broke up, Assistant Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MRM_1">Moose</persName> emphasized need for
                                <gloss target="#t_GOK_1">GOK</gloss> to act quickly lest $12 million
                            in <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> credit now available be lost as
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> nears end its fiscal year.</p>
                        <p>7. Comment: Meeting, originally set for 20 minutes but stretched to 35
                            minutes, was marked by extreme warmth, mainly due to Justice Marshall’s
                            long association with Kenya and its leaders. Moi seemed genuinely
                            thankful for presence of USDel, particularly President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>’s son. I believe meeting was
                            extremely useful opportunity to make <pb n="411" facs="0443"
                                xml:id="pg_411"/>known importance we attach to continuation of
                            constitutionality in Kenya. Point could not have been made by better
                            person than Justice Marshall who had important role in drafting Kenyan
                            Constitution.</p>
                        <p>8. While discussion of Horn did not break new ground, it was useful
                            exchange in as much as it re-emphasized our mutual interest in
                            influencing other interested parties (Somalis and Arabs by US;
                            Ethiopians by Kenyans) toward moderation and fact that stability in Horn
                            is in everybody’s interest. I believe it would be useful to follow-up
                            Kenya’s Ethiopian link with <gloss target="#t_FonMin_1">FonMin</gloss>
                            Waiyaki at upcoming <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>9. In any future meeting re our economic development assistance to Kenya,
                            I would expect to give assurances of continued US support within
                            budgetary limitations. I shall follow up quickly on $12 million <gloss
                                target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> credit as <gloss target="#t_MOD_1"
                                >MOD</gloss> has already indicated to Embassy it wishes to accept
                            this credit. Naturally, Kenyatta’s death and funeral have delayed all
                            government business.</p>
                        <p>10. I might add here that Kenyatta funeral was an enormous feat which
                                <gloss target="#t_GOK_1">GOK</gloss> carried out with impressive
                            organizational skill and dignity (to be reported in <gloss

                        </list>
                        <p>Last February the Kenyans gave us an extensive list of weapons they
                            wished to obtain. The list included helicopters armed with wire-<pb
                                n="412" facs="0444" xml:id="pg_412"/>guided anti-tank (<gloss
                                target="#t_TOW_1">TOW</gloss>) missiles. The Joint State/Defense
                            Survey Team which went to Kenya in April concluded that one of Kenya’s
                            most pressing defense needs is for an air cavalry brigade composed of
                            helicopters armed with such weapons. The team found that this capability
                            would provide the speed and mobility required to respond to attack along
                            Kenya’s lengthy frontiers.<note n="2" xml:id="d156fn2">See <ref

                            desire to proceed with this purchase, valued at $44 million.</p>
                        <p>For reasons set forth below, we believe approval of this request would
                            require making an exception to one of the prohibitions in PD–13,<note
                                n="4" xml:id="d156fn4">See <ref target="#d151fn3">footnote 3,

                            directive. The <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> has recommended that
                            such an exception be made, and I am now seeking your approval of that
                            recommendation.</p>
                        <p>The relevant provision of PD–13 states:</p>
                        <quote><p>“The United States will not be the first supplier to introduce
                                into a region an advanced weapons system which creates a new or
                                significantly higher combat capability.”</p></quote>
                        <p>We have previously informed Congress that the determination of what is
                            “advanced” will vary from region to region. We believe a
                            helicopter-mounted <gloss target="#t_TOW_1">TOW</gloss> missile
                            capability is an advanced system with respect to sub-Saharan Africa, for
                            the following reasons:</p>
                        <quote><p>—the U.S. has not previously provided a <hi rend="italic"
                                    >helicopter borne</hi> anti-tank missile system to any African
                                country. (The <gloss target="#t_TOW_1">TOW</gloss> itself has been
                                provided to Ethiopia, Tunisia, and Morocco.)</p>
                            <p>—we have no evidence that the Soviets have yet provided such a system
                                in sub-Saharan Africa, although they are providing this capability
                                to Libya and Algeria. (They have provided a ground-based system to
                                Ethiopia, Libya, Angola, and Uganda.)</p>
                            <p>—the Europeans have not provided this capability in sub-Saharan
                                Africa, though the Kenyans are exploring French sources.</p></quote>
                        <p>One of the grounds for an exception under PD–13 is that a friendly
                            country needs the weaponry in question to offset quantitative and other
                            disadvantages in order to maintain a regional balance. We believe the
                            transfer to Kenya of helicopters armed with <gloss target="#t_TOW_1"
                                >TOW</gloss> missiles satisfies this criterion. Kenya is more
                            supportive of American and moderate international political objectives
                            than any other East African country. At the same time, Kenya’s
                            neighbors, especially Ethiopia, have formidable tank forces which create
                            an imbalance in the region. A helicopter-<pb n="413" facs="0445"
                                xml:id="pg_413"/>mounted <gloss target="#t_TOW_1">TOW</gloss>
                            capability would help Kenya defend against this external threat and thus
                            reduce the imbalance. The nature of the terrain along Kenya’s borders
                            and the large distances that must be covered to defend the lengthy
                            borders make this weapons system the most cost-effective deterrent.</p>
                        <p>Approval of this transfer would be welcomed by Kenya as a clear sign of
                            U.S. support for its territorial integrity. It would particularly
                            appreciate the gesture at this time in view of President Kenyatta’s
                            recent death.</p>
                        <p>We would assist in the financing of this sale and have taken account of
                            it in the FY 79 arms transfer ceiling plan.</p>
                        <p>There may be some Congressional criticism of the sale, on grounds that it
                            is contrary to the Administration’s arms restraint policy.</p>
                        <p>In order to minimize the effect of granting this exception, we would
                            suggest that there be a caveat making it explicit that the exception
                            results from the unique circumstances in which Kenya finds itself and
                            shall not have precedential value in deciding whether exceptions to
                            PD–13 ought to be made with respect to other arms transfers to countries
                            in the region.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">RECOMMENDATION:</p>
                        <p>That, subject to the caveat just noted, you authorize an exception to

                            area. A dissident unit fled toward the border pursued by <persName

                        <p>2. We received today text of a message from <persName corresp="#p_AID_1"
                                >Idi Amin</persName> to Secretary General <persName

                            alleged attacks by Tanzanian forces and asked <persName

                            “prevail on Tanzania to withdraw from Uganda peacefully.”<note n="2"

                                <persName corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName>’s message to the
                            Security Council President for January (Mills of Jamaica) and to the
                            other Council members.</p>
                        <p>3. The next step, if any, in the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>’s
                            handling of the Ugandan complaint depends very much on the actions of
                            the other members of the Council, in which the positions of the three
                            African members (Nigeria, Gabon and Zambia) will be decisive. Without
                            African support, we doubt that there will be any inclination within the
                            Council to respond in one way or another to <persName corresp="#p_AID_1"
                                >Amin</persName>’s message. It is possible that Kuwaiti PermRep
                            Bishara, who assumes the Council’s Presidency on February 1, will be
                            more inclined to be responsive to <persName corresp="#p_AID_1"
                                >Amin</persName> than the current Council President, but we doubt
                            that Ishara will take any step, even toward informal consultations,
                            without African support. We are confident that the Soviets will also
                            adjust their moves to the African position.</p>
                        <p>4. The Ugandan move to the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> places the
                            United States in a potentially embarrassing position. On the one hand,
                            it is very difficult, as was the case with Cambodia and the Vietnamese
                                invasion,<note n="3" xml:id="d158fn3">In December 1978, Vietnam
                                invaded Cambodia (Kampuchea) to overthrow the Khmer Rouge regime.
                                The United States condemned the invasion as a violation of
                                international law.</note> to be seen supporting someone whose record
                            is as awful as <persName corresp="#p_AID_1">Idi Amin</persName>’s. On
                            the other hand, an important principle of international law and the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Charter is at stake if the
                            international community turns a blind eye toward Tanzania’s invasion of
                            Uganda, despite the mitigating circumstances of Uganda’s prior invasion
                            of Tanzania. There are two points which we need to consider:</p>
                        <p><pb n="416" facs="0448" xml:id="pg_416"/>A. How should we react if a
                            formal request for inscription of a Security Council agenda item on
                            Uganda’s complaint is made? IO and <gloss target="#t_AF_1">AF</gloss>
                            believe we should follow our traditional policy in favor of inscription.
                            We could tell the press that in line with our well-known policy, we
                            support the Council’s hearing any complaint a member state chooses to
                            bring, and this includes a complaint by Uganda. At the same time, we
                            would totally disassociate ourselves from the Ugandan regime, as we did
                            in the case of Pol Pot and Cambodia.</p>
                        <p>B. What should we say to the Tanzanians, and when? We believe that we
                            should, if only for the record, attempt to dissuade <persName
                                corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nyerere</persName> from deeper military
                            involvement in Uganda.</p>
                        <p>5. Would appreciate your urgent reaction to above, and reporting on any
                            discussions you have had with Tanzanian officials in last several days
                            as well as your best estimate of Tanzanian intentions.</p>

                        <p>2. Embassy appreciates dilemma described <gloss target="#t_reftel_1"
                                >reftel</gloss> regarding our bilateral Tanzania interests on one
                            hand and our interest in upholding principles of international law and
                                <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Charter on the other. Our general
                            preference is to duck on this issue as much as we can. Since Embassy is
                            not clear about process of inscribing an item on <gloss
                                target="#t_UNSC_1">UNSC</gloss> agenda, we do not know what is
                            involved in trying to take such evasive action. We would think, however,
                            that it would be as procedurally possible as it is substantively
                            desirable to take our cue from Africans on this matter and let them take
                            the lead. If they go along with inscription, so can we. If they oppose
                            inscription, presumably they will pro<pb n="417" facs="0449"
                                xml:id="pg_417"/>pose another way of dealing with the issue—e.g.,
                            via <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>—to which we can respectfully
                            defer.</p>
                        <p>3. If Africans oppose without leaving us a way out, our first choice is
                            to abstain. If other considerations of international organization
                            principle are overriding, we can support inscription without
                            unacceptable damage, as long as we are not out in front of others. We
                            should cast our vote but lie low in any debate. In our public remarks,
                            we should follow guidelines suggested para 4A <gloss
                                target="#t_reftel_1">reftel</gloss>, but we would hope for a more
                            effective dissociation from <persName corresp="#p_AID_1"
                            >Amin</persName>’s regime than we were able to achieve (here at least)
                            from Pol Pot.</p>
                        <p>4. In any <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> consideration of this matter
                            and consequent <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> position, caution is
                            required in dealing with notion of invasion in context of

                            crossed the border, but it is not a very clean model of an invasion. We
                            think that this peculiar aspect of fighting, rather than mitigating
                            circumstances of prior Uganda invasion (para 4 <gloss
                                target="#t_reftel_1">reftel</gloss>), should govern consideration of
                            how international law and organization principles are applied.</p>
                        <p>5. On Tanzania intentions, we think it premature to go beyond saying that
                                <persName corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nyerere</persName> intends to keep
                            military pressure on <persName corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName> in the
                            hope of bringing him down. Depending on events in Uganda, this could
                            include either pushing Tanzanian military elements further into Uganda
                            or promptly recalling them to their own territory. We still think the
                            odds are against a full-blown march on Kampala but are reevaluating that
                            judgment daily.</p>
                        <p>6. As for what and when we discuss matter with Tanzanians, we should do
                            nothing unless and until the question of inscription at <gloss
                                target="#t_UNSC_1">UNSC</gloss> actually comes up. We will then be
                            in a position to question, consult, and perhaps influence the TanGov. To
                            go in now will not produce anything useful.</p>

                            deteriorating steadily. The Tanzanians took Masaka—some 80 miles from

                        <p>The Libyans apparently have been airlifting supplies and a small number

                        <p>The outcome will depend on whether the Tanzanians continue to press the

                        <p>—The Tanzanians may soon face serious logistical problems as their supply
                            lines lengthen and heavy rains make transportation difficult.</p>

                        <p>The Ugandans’ resistance has been weak, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1

                            and fought, they were quickly routed by Tanzanian BM–21 rockets. Ugandan
                            losses in men and equipment have been significant. The Ugandans are
                            suffering serious shortages of equipment, ammunition, and other

                                >Nyerere</persName> has no desire for mediation at this point.
                            Government sources denied a Tripoli broadcast’s claim that <persName

                            privately, the Tanzanians continue to press their demands that the

                            believe that the army will fragment, and that disorder and near-anarchy
                            will ensue. Eventually, a military junta is likely to emerge. Its makeup
                            is hard to predict, but may include anti-<persName corresp="#p_AID_1"
                                >Amin</persName> junior and middle-ranking officers, plus some
                            Ugandan military exiles.</p>
                        <p>—The Ugandan Army, despite its current disarray, is the only indigenous
                            force that counts. <persName corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nyerere</persName> and
                            the exiles will have to come to terms with what remains of it.</p>
                        <p>—The only alternative is an indefinite Tanzanian military occupation,
                            which we think would be unfeasible.</p>
                        <p>—[<hi rend="italic">1 line not declassified</hi>] the Ugandan Army
                            consisted of some 17,000 men, perhaps 6 to 7,000 of whom are southern
                            Sudanese. These Sudanese are regarded as “<persName corresp="#p_AID_1"
                                >Amin</persName>’s mercenaries,” are disliked by the other troops,
                            and, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>], are
                            nervous about their future and wish to return home.</p>
                        <p>—If the Sudanese depart, a large core of the remaining army would be
                            Kakwa and Lugbara, tribes which live in northwestern Uganda. These
                            groups have been predominant in the Ugandan military for the last five
                            years, and cannot easily be disregarded. They are traditional rivals:
                            the Kakwa are largely Muslim, and the Lugbara largely Christian. A
                            minority of the Muslims are believed to be loyal to <persName
                                corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName>. Senior officers such as Major
                            General Isaac Lumago and Brigadier Isaac Maliyamungu are closely
                            identified with <persName corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName>, whereas
                            younger officers are involved in anti-<persName corresp="#p_AID_1"
                                >Amin</persName> plotting. Major General Mustafa Adrisi, the
                            disaffected former vice president, is from yet another northern Ugandan

                        <p>We know little about the other troops. Some are southerners and
                            easterners—tribes which were predominant during the British colonial
                            period and which are antagonistic to the northerners. The southerners
                            originally formed the military elite; they were well-educated and
                            trained in British military academies. But after <persName

                            Ojok, and with the Ugandan People’s Alliance (<gloss target="#t_UPA_1"
                                >UPA</gloss>), a loose confederation of small, leftist-oriented
                            civilian groups. Okello originally favored a military government, but is
                            now backing <persName corresp="#p_OM_1">Obote</persName>. <persName

                        <p>These groups and others have been armed and trained by the Tanzanian
                            intelligence service. They are now fighting within Uganda without any

                            himself does not seem to have a significant following within Uganda. The

                            the Ugandan army, make support from that quarter doubtful. Therefore, if

                            relations with any new Ugandan government. Although we would wish to be
                            among the first to express our good wishes, it would probably be best to
                            wait until some move has been made by such key countries as Kenya,
                            Nigeria and Sudan.</p>
                        <p>We currently envision three possible scenarios for <persName
                                corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName>’s overthrow:</p>
                        <p>(a) <persName corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName> is removed (deposed,
                            killed, exiled, etc.) by opposition elements in his own government. If
                            the new regime appears to have support throughout the country and can
                            maintain law and order, we should not hesitate to make an appropriate
                            statement to the press and have representatives from Embassy Nairobi
                            visit Kampala as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>(b) If, on the other hand, the overthrow of <persName corresp="#p_AID_1"
                                >Amin</persName> results in chaos with various factions competing to
                            succeed him, it might be weeks or <pb n="421" facs="0453"
                                xml:id="pg_421"/>months before a new government could establish
                            control. We would have time to work out when and how we might like to
                            re-establish relations.</p>
                        <p>(c) Ugandan exile forces might overthrow <persName corresp="#p_AID_1"
                                >Amin</persName> in cooperation with Tanzanian military forces. The
                            Tanzanian connections to any exile group taking power will be examined
                            meticulously, and we would want to prevent any appearance of having
                            instigated or encouraged Tanzanian actions. President <persName
                                corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nyerere</persName> would deeply resent any
                            indication that he might have been a U.S. client in these operations,
                            and we should try to maintain our current posture of interested
                            observer. The Kenyans will certainly be suspicious of any
                            Tanzanian-dominated government, and we should probably await some sign
                            from them as well as Great Britain before sending in a
                            representative.</p>

                            make the following points:</p>
                        <p>—We have queried our Embassy in Nairobi concerning your request and our
                            Ambassador believes he can make an approach on your behalf but we
                            believe the approach should be limited as follows: Quote</p>
                        <p>—Pres. <persName corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nyerere</persName> told Amb. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJW_1">Spain</persName> in Dar es Salaam that he
                            believes it would be useful to have a discreet discussion with you on
                            ways in which your two governments might cooperate to resolve the Uganda
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>—<persName corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nyerere</persName> asked <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJW_1">Spain</persName> if U.S. would be willing to
                            relay this message in the interest of bringing an early end to the
                            Tanzania-Uganda conflict.</p>
                        <p>—We agreed to do so for that reason, but as you are aware we have tried
                            not to become involved in this dispute and have hoped that an African
                            solution could be reached.</p>
                        <p>—Further, we are merely seeking in this matter to assist communication
                            between two of our friends; we do not have, nor do we seek, any
                            relationship to or involvement in the topics to be discussed.</p>
                        <p>—If you desire to talk to <persName corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nyerere</persName>
                            about Uganda, we assume you will wish to arrange that through your own
                            channels. If you desire, we will also advise Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJW_1">Spain</persName> to tell President <persName
                                corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nyerere</persName> that you are interested in
                            talking with <persName corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nyerere</persName> about Uganda
                            and will welcome a direct communication from him. Unquote.<note n="3"

                                Salaam, April 18, the Department announced that the U.S. Government
                                would like to normalize relations with Uganda and, as a first step,
                                would send a team to Kampala from the Embassy in Nairobi to
                                establish contact with the Ugandan Provisional Government (<gloss

                        <p>1. Summary: Mission was entirely successful in achieving all its
                            objectives. We had substantive conversations with President <persName
                                corresp="#p_LY_1">Lule</persName> and with the Ministers of Finance
                            and Economic Planning (Sam Sabagareka), Health, (Dr. Arnold Bisasi),
                            Reconstruction and Rehabilitation (Andrew Adimola), as well as with
                            Presidential Adviser Semei Nyanzi and the Permanent Secretary in the
                            Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Nathan Barungi. Upon our arrival in
                            Kampala, we met with Foreign Minister, who was on his way to Nairobi for
                            talks with the Kenyan Government. We conveyed the points set forth in
                            State 097405 that the US accepts the <gloss target="#t_UPG_1"
                                >UPG</gloss> as the Government of Uganda, is encouraged by <gloss

                            rights, are working to lift aid restrictions and will open our Embassy
                            as soon as possible. The Ugandans received this word with evident
                            pleasure.</p>
                        <p>2. Kampala is calm and completely under the control of the Tanzanian
                            Peoples Defense Force. There are many control points throughout the
                            city, at which identity documents of pedestrians and motorists are
                            checked by the <gloss target="#t_TPDF_1">TPDF</gloss>. There is,
                            however, no harassment of the civilian population, and all of the
                            soldiers we saw were invariably polite and well disciplined in carrying
                            out their duties.</p>
                        <p>3. Uganda is an economic disaster area. This disaster came about not from
                            the single episode of the war, but is rather the result of eight years
                            of plundering and maladministration by the <persName corresp="#p_AID_1"
                                >Amin</persName> government. There is almost no foreign exchange.
                            Industry is at an almost total standstill. Sugar refining is down to ten
                            percent of pre-<persName corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName> levels.
                            Cement production has ceased altogether, as has the manufacture of
                            glass, agricultural implements, etc. Uganda’s once prosperous agricul<pb
                                n="428" facs="0460" xml:id="pg_428"/>tural sector has sunk to the
                            subsistence level, with cotton, coffee and tea down to only a small
                            fraction of earlier production. The looting which took place April 11–14
                            throughout Kampala, as the Ugandans released the pent-up rage at
                                <persName corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName> and his cronies (who
                            owned most of the retail establishments), has completely destroyed the
                            commercial life of the city. Every shop in Kampala has been stripped
                            bare of all of its goods and furniture, display windows exist no longer,
                            and office machinery and files have been destroyed. The <gloss
                                target="#t_POL_1">POL</gloss> situation is desperate, with all
                            public service stations closed. Some small quantities of black market
                            gasoline exist at very high prices.</p>
                        <p>4. On the bright side, subsistence agriculture and the informal,
                            traditional market mechanisms are functioning well. There is plenty of
                            food in the liberated areas. Markets we saw, both in Kampala and on the
                            road between Kampala and Entebbe, were well stocked and busy. There
                            were, of course, no imported items or manufactured goods, but there were
                            plenty of plantains, sweet potatoes, onions, green beans, tomatoes, and
                            other staple items of diet. Thus, there is no famine and no necessity
                            for emergency food imports. (This may not be true in the country at
                            large. Many of the unliberated areas are in the more arid, less fertile
                            north, and there may be food shortages there.)</p>
                        <p>5. The new government is starting out under an immense handicap. All of
                            the government offices were looted, furniture and files destroyed.
                            Consequently, the new government is largely operating out of the
                            ministers’ hotel rooms or the conference rooms in the Nile Mansions
                            Hotel. Nevertheless, the new cabinet has started off at a fast pace.
                            Although the government had only been in place ten days when we arrived
                            in Kampala, it has already done an amazing amount of research and
                            organizational planning. The <gloss target="#t_UPG_1">UPG</gloss> has
                            adopted very strong human rights policy (not surprising for a successor
                            government to <persName corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName>) and is
                            pledged to fair and public trials for all accused <persName
                                corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName> officials. All of the new
                            government whom we met impressed us immensely with their energy,
                            commitment to the difficult task facing them, and their remarkable
                            realism. They are beginning their work from an indescribably low point.
                            Their resources are few, but their determination is great. They are
                            counting on the help of the rest of the world in this endeavor, and it
                            is the unanimous consensus of my delegation that they deserve it. An
                            initial <gloss target="#t_UPG_1">UPG</gloss> statement of its aid needs
                            is being sent by separate message.<note n="3" xml:id="d167fn3">In
                                telegram 7337 from Nairobi, April 25, the Embassy reported that the
                                    <hi rend="italic">Nairobi Daily Nation</hi> published an
                                interview with the Ugandan Finance Minister who suggested that
                                Uganda would need $2 billion over the next year to aid recovery.
                                (National Archives, RG 59, Central Foreign Policy File,

                        <p><pb n="429" facs="0461" xml:id="pg_429"/>6. The setting: The Entebbe
                            airport runway is virtually undamaged. The control tower is now in
                            operation (although all of the navigational systems are not). Any sort
                            or size aircraft can be accommodated at Entebbe. The airport buildings
                            are damaged, but not as extensively as we had been led to believe. The
                            airport is still closed to all traffic except small chartered aircraft
                            from Nairobi and Dar es Salaam. The airport is controlled by the <gloss
                                target="#t_TPDF_1">TPDF</gloss> (which as far as we could observe
                            provides all the security throughout the liberated areas. The liberation
                                (<gloss target="#t_UNLF_1">UNLF</gloss>) forces are all at the
                            front.)</p>
                        <p>7. The road between Entebbe and Kampala is in relatively good shape.
                            There is an occasional shell crater in the road or along the shoulder,
                            and one sees a few burned out APCs and other vehicles along the road.
                            But there is remarkably little war damage to the houses along the way,
                            and the population seems to be going about its business as usual. The
                            scene of the worst fighting was a pass between two low hills, where a
                            Libyan force coming south from Kampala in an attempt to retake Entebbe
                            airport was ambushed. According to reliable sources, including the
                            British representative now in Kampala, some 400 Libyans died at this
                            spot. Among the derelict items still on the scene is a GM–21 “Stalin
                            organ” rocket launcher.</p>
                        <p>8. Kampala itself suffered relatively little damage from the fighting. A
                            few buildings, where <persName corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName>’s
                            soldiers holed up, are extensively damaged, but the destruction from the
                            war is quite localized and limited. The destruction from the looting, on
                            the other hand, is everywhere and extensive. It would be impossible to
                            estimate how many thousands of square feet of store windows have been
                            shattered in Kampala. As far as one could tell, not a single business
                            establishment was missed. The looters took everything that would be of
                            value to them and destroyed the rest. The same pattern was repeated at
                            government offices. The streets of Kampala were littered with an
                            incredible amount of paper from pillaged filing cabinets. Broken glass
                            was everywhere. Most of the shop owners had not yet troubled to board up
                            their establishments, so the face of the town as one drives down the
                            streets is one of empty, gaping shop windows and store fronts.</p>
                        <p>9. As far as we were able to determine, the <gloss target="#t_TPDF_1"
                                >TPDF</gloss> did nothing to restrain the looting for the first
                            three days the city was occupied. By that time everything was gone or
                            destroyed. After listening to stories from all sides in Kampala, it is
                            actually not difficult to imagine the spirit that must have seized the
                            looters. For years consumer goods have been of increasingly short supply
                            in Uganda. Luxury articles were reserved for the army, the security
                            apparatus, and other privileged groups of <persName corresp="#p_AID_1"
                                >Amin</persName>’s supporters. The common man could buy nothing; his
                            money was virtually worthless. Further, most of the retail commerce had
                            been expropriated from its original owners and taken over by <pb n="430"
                                facs="0462" xml:id="pg_430"/><persName corresp="#p_AID_1"
                                >Amin</persName> cronies. Thus, commerce in the modern sector was
                            seen simply another manifestation of a regime that was hated as much as
                            it was feared. When the controls were off, it is understandable that the
                            peoples’ frustration and rage burst forth.</p>
                        <p>10. The economy: The economy of Uganda has been devastated—not only from
                            the war and the looting, but, principally, from <persName
                                corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName>’s maladministration and the
                            plundering of all economic assets by <persName corresp="#p_AID_1"
                                >Amin</persName> and his crowd. The story is truly dismal. During
                            the early years of his reign, <persName corresp="#p_AID_1"
                                >Amin</persName> systematically expropriated almost all of the
                            industry in the country, and then he allowed it to fall into such
                            disrepair that by now almost none of it is functional. The flight of
                            both expatriate experts and qualified Ugandans from <persName
                                corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName>’s brutality contributed greatly
                            to the process. At present, Uganda has practically no operational
                            industry other than the breweries at Jinja. (Jinja fell the day we
                            arrived, and the first beer Kampala had seen for weeks arrived the
                            following evening to the unrestrained jubilation of the Kampala
                            populace).</p>
                        <p>11. As with industry, cash crop agriculture stagnated under <persName
                                corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName>. Prices paid the farmers were
                            held artificially low, and insufficient foreign exchange was devoted to
                            agricultural implements and fertilizers, with the result that most of
                            the country’s farmers went back to growing subsistence crops rather than
                            producing commodities for export.</p>
                        <p>The looting has taken care of what was left of the retail commerce in the
                            country. Shops have no stocks; warehouses have been stripped, and there
                            are simply no goods to be bought or sold.</p>
                        <p>12. With the road from Kenya still blocked by <persName
                                corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName> forces, no <gloss
                                target="#t_POL_1">POL</gloss> trucks have been able to come through
                            and there is very little <gloss target="#t_POL_1">POL</gloss> and hence
                            little civilian motor transport. There is something of a black market,
                            but supplies are soon almost exhausted even here and prices very
                            high.</p>
                        <p>13. The government: We met President <persName corresp="#p_LY_1"
                                >Lule</persName>; one of his two most senior advisers, Semei Nyanzi;
                            plus the three most important ministers concerned with the
                            reconstruction of the country, together with a host of lesser
                            officialdom and some of the remaining civil servants. The new government
                            impressed us all by their obvious commitment to the task at hand. They
                            recognize fully the immensity of the job to be done, but they are
                            determined rather than cowed by the bleak prospects facing them. One of
                            the things that struck us most was the realism of the people with whom
                            we talked. They recognized that there will be no easy answers. They know
                            that the undertaking will be a long one, and they recognize how
                            desperately they will need the help of the rest of the world to get
                            their country going again. Obviously, mere determination will not be
                            sufficient to ensure success. Just how able these people will be to cope
                            with the problems facing Uganda is at this point impossi<pb n="431"
                                facs="0463" xml:id="pg_431"/>ble to predict. We know they will give
                            it a good try; we hope they will have the capacity to pull it off. On
                            the negative side, many of the new people have had little or no previous
                            government experience. They are bright and well educated (there are a
                            large number of university professors and medical practitioners amongst
                            them), but they have never had to cope with administering a state. On
                            the positive side, we can say with assurance that they will be able to
                            do a much better job than <persName corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName>
                            and his government did. The new government is still disorganized. They
                            have no offices in which to work; they are only beginning to fill out
                            their staffs; the files of many ministries and offices have been
                            destroyed; and the government has no money. It would be difficult to
                            imagine a more difficult point at which to start attempting to govern a
                            country.</p>
                        <p>14. Policy and ideology: We could detect no ideological bias in any of
                            the people with whom we spoke. They all appeared to be pragmatists, and
                            almost all of them (perhaps it was only because of their auditors) spoke
                            of the need of getting free enterprise going again in Uganda. The tone
                            of our interlocutors was for the most part anti-<persName
                                corresp="#p_OM_1">Obote</persName>. Adimola (protect) was vehement
                            in his denunciation of the former President, and called <persName
                                corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName> “only an extension of <persName
                                corresp="#p_OM_1">Obote</persName>.” President <persName
                                corresp="#p_LY_1">Lule</persName> and Minister of Health Bisasi
                            referred to the United States and the United Kingdom as Uganda’s “very
                            special friends,” on whom Uganda would have to count more than on any
                            other sources of help.</p>
                        <p>15. As might have been expected, the new Ugandan Government has adopted a
                            very strong human rights stance. The President and each of the ministers
                            with whom we spoke stressed to us that the greatest tragedy that has
                            befallen Uganda, more than the deaths, more than the economic
                            deterioration, has been the “dehumanization” of the whole population
                            under the terror of the <persName corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName>
                            regime. Minister Adimola perhaps best expressed the situation. We have
                            found, he said, that so many of our people “are no longer real human
                            beings.” They have, he said, little respect for human life. They fear
                            and distrust everyone. As urgently as Uganda needs economic
                            reconstruction, even more it needs, he said, “moral and spiritual
                            rehabilitation.” He said that if Uganda rebuilt its economy and
                            neglected its moral regeneration, “we will find ourselves in another
                            eight years destroying our country again.”</p>
                        <p>16. In line with this policy, we have seen no evidence that the new
                            government has sanctioned any retaliations on <persName
                                corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName>’s people. They told us that
                            anyone accused of crimes under the former regime would be given fair and
                            public trials. (From what we and Western journalists have seen of the
                            files of the State Research Bureau and the Kampala prison, it won’t be
                            difficult to get convictions).</p>
                        <p>17. Aid requirements: We have transmitted <gloss target="#t_UPG_1"
                                >UPG</gloss>’s initial aid requirements statement by separate
                            message. There is no immediate <pb n="432" facs="0464" xml:id="pg_432"
                            />necessity for food. We think there will be a need for medicines and
                            hospital supplies. This will be the subject of subsequent messages. The
                            quantities or dollar amounts are impossible to estimate now.</p>
                        <p>18. The <gloss target="#t_UPG_1">UPG</gloss> needs foreign exchange
                            desperately. It may have claims on monies in foreign banks, but it
                            doesn’t know yet how much or where. It has some coffee to sell, but
                            again, no details have yet been established. In the interim it must
                            start buying things—most importantly <gloss target="#t_POL_1"
                                >POL</gloss>. Few, if any suppliers will give Uganda credit.
                            Certainly (according to Nairobi industry sources) the oil companies will
                            be most reluctant.</p>
                        <p>19. The <gloss target="#t_UPG_1">UPG</gloss> today received a cash grant
                            of one million pounds from the British. They asked us to provide some
                            cash grant aid as well. We pointed to congressional problems and
                            suggested going to the <gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss>. They
                            probably hadn’t thought of that yet but took up the suggestion quickly
                            and said they would send a delegation to Washington within two weeks. We
                            will inform Department further when we have details.</p>
                        <p>20. US Embassy: We think that it will be necessary to get a permanent
                            party into Kampala as soon as possible, by which we would mean as soon
                            as the road from Nairobi to Kampala is open. The inchoate state of the
                            new Ugandan Government, the chaotic condition of the economy, plus the
                            extreme difficulty in communications combine to make it all but
                            impossible to deal effectively with the UGP or plan US policy rationally
                            without a presence in Kampala. I would suggest an initial team of
                            political officer (whether or not with charge title), admin officer and
                            aid officer. As soon as feasible I would add an American secretary and a
                            communicator (OTP).</p>
                        <p>21. U.S. real estate: Our chancery is presently sublet to the French
                            Embassy, which has six months according to the lease to vacate. The
                            French Ambassador has promised to seek new quarters at once and move out
                            earlier if possible. The offices are in good shape and have <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> furniture.</p>
                        <p>22. The residence has been used as an international primary school. We
                            can probably get it back and put it in shape in three months. Two of our
                            other houses can be occupied in about the same time. We are recommending
                            that the remaining two houses be sold. They are very run down and are in
                            poor locations. We will send a separate message with more details on the
                            properties.</p>
                        <p>23. Temporary office space: The <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss>
                            Embassy has no space. The British High Commission does and has offered
                            us suitable and sufficiently spacious offices. Separate message
                            follows.</p>
                        <p>24. Vehicles. We will need at least two vehicles (sedan and minibus) as
                            soon as we have people in Kampala. Suggest getting authority now to buy
                            foreign made vehicles in Nairobi.</p>
                        <p><pb n="433" facs="0465" xml:id="pg_433"/>25. Administrative problems: The
                            administrative situation in Kampala is obviously chaotic, but the
                            British are coping with getting started under these circumstances, and
                            so can we. We will have to support the operation extensively from
                            Nairobi. Nothing is available in Kampala, including foodstuffs
                            acceptable to American tastes, beverages, paper products, etc. All
                            official supplies must come from here. Communications at first will be
                            slow and arduous. It won’t be easy, but it will be manageable.</p>
                        <p>26. Local employees: Several of our former local employees made contact
                            with us and are ready to go back to work if we want them.</p>
                        <p>27. I reiterate, we should become reestablished in Kampala soonest. We
                            led the world in condemning <persName corresp="#p_AID_1"
                            >Amin</persName>. We must not be the last in moving to cooperate with
                            and assist the new government. The psychological boost of our presence
                            will be as important initially as our advice and material
                                assistance.<note n="4" xml:id="d167fn4">In telegram 7421 from

                            said, and we are trying to create a government which will not repeat
                            past history. We seek a stable society, a democratic system for our

                            Washington, everyone has been most sympathetic to our situation. We have
                            to help our people psychologically and morally, especially the young
                            people who have not known in the past eight years a moral or rational
                            environment.</p>
                        <p>3. Nyanzi said he wanted to make two points particularly. First, Tanzania
                            has no <gloss target="#t_rpt_1">rpt</gloss> no intention of trying to
                            impose any policy or program on us. There are differences between us and
                            the Tanzanians and <persName corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nyerere</persName> has
                            told <persName corresp="#p_LY_1">Lule</persName> the Tanzanian system
                            can’t work in Uganda. We need economic relations with all surrounding
                            countries. We have urged, therefore, normalization of relations between
                            Kenya and Tanzania and open borders. We understand why Kenya took
                            position it did towards <persName corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName>
                            regime. We now have established good relations with Kenya. Secondly, we
                            do need help from US. We recognize legal prohibitions against aid to
                            Uganda must be rescinded and that these actions take time. We have
                            appreciated two delegations sent to Kampala and <persName

                        <p>4. Nyanzi then outlined current organization and plans of Ugandan
                            Provisional Government. One immediate problem is the numerous arms in
                            the hands of the people. In eastern Uganda there have already been
                            incidents which the presence of arms in the area have made more serious.
                            Another problem was brewing in western Uganda. We hope when our troops
                            and the Tanzanians finish overcoming the last remnants of <persName
                                corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName>’s forces that they will assume a
                            policing role. We would like to license the possession of all weapons.
                            The first elections will be to the district councils hopefully this
                            month. The district councils will <pb n="435" facs="0467"
                                xml:id="pg_435"/>then elect a constituent assembly. We intend to ask

                        <p>5. Secretary said it is good to hear of the progress the new government
                            has already made. We welcomed the end of the <persName
                                corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName> regime and wish to have good and
                            close relations with the new Ugandan Government. We recognize there are
                            problems of rehabilitation as well as economic needs. President

                            embargo on Uganda which means private charitable institutions can begin

                            relations will you establish with them?</p>
                        <p>6. Nyanzi replied that his government distinguishes between the leader of
                            Libya and the Libyan people. The former is a problem, but we are not
                            antagonistic to the Libyan people. Indeed many young Libyan soldiers who
                            were sent to fight in Uganda did not know why they were there. It was a
                            tragic situation because many were killed. We have no animosity towards
                            Muslims and we see the possibility for cooperation with Sudan and
                            Egypt.</p>

                            totaling dollars 1.3 billion.) We are delighted to hear the
                            Uganda-Kenya-Tanzania relationship is developing in a constructive
                            fashion. This is important for the region as well as for the individual

                        <p>8. Secretary then asked about situation of the army and police forces.
                            Nyanzi said the present forces would be demobilized and new, smaller
                            forces constituted. UK has been asked to help with police because their
                            system has been used in the past.</p>
                        <p>9. Nyanzi said we are cautiously establishing relations with China, not
                            unlike US approach. <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> is offering
                            practical help without reference to ideology. Secretary said he is
                            delighted to hear that. US–<gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>
                            relations were for many years difficult, but now we are beginning to
                            build up a good relationship. Just in the past week we have moved
                            forward by agreeing to work together in the fields of technology and
                            cultural exchanges. We are pleased Chinese are now prepared to help you.
                            They built a good railway in Tanzania. We welcome their help to you.</p>
                        <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_KRV_1">Keeley</persName> asked about Uganda’s
                            relations with others, e.g. <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and
                            Sudan. Relations with Sudan are coming along well, Nyanzi replied, but
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> has not been very
                            forthcoming. Ugandan people know <persName corresp="#p_AID_1"
                                >Amin</persName> regime spent a good deal of money for arms bought
                            from the Soviets. These arms were used against other Ugandans. It is now
                            difficult to convince the people of the utility of having relations with
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. It is also difficult to deal
                            with Soviet state organizations. Secretary concurred state enterprises
                            are always difficult to deal with and Soviets seem to be more willing to
                            supply military rather than economic assistance. US view is that we help
                            where we can economically, encourage countries to develop their own
                            institutions in accordance with their own culture and values and stress
                            that each country must decide these matters for itself. Nyanzi said he
                            and the Ugandan people recognize this is US position and appreciate it.

                        <p>I am heartened to know that after eight years of cruelty and terror the
                            Ugandan people will now be governed by leaders who, as you wrote in your
                            letter, are totally committed to basic human rights and to the
                            restoration of unity, freedom and democracy.</p>
                        <p>You face an extraordinarily difficult task in reconstructing and

                            removed the trade embargo on Uganda and have initiated legislative

                        <p>2. Summary. Most of July 6 conversation with <persName corresp="#p_BG_1"
                                >Binaisa</persName> was devoted to areas where he wants US help.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BG_1">Binaisa</persName> gives impression of
                            man in charge. He is conscious of need to project image of stability and
                            believes he needs first to deliver on consumer goods to obtain domestic
                            support for his government. End summary.</p>
                        <p>3. I met for an hour July 6 with President <persName corresp="#p_BG_1"
                                >Binaisa</persName>. Office of Protocol notetaker was only other
                            person present. Most of conversation centered on aid, for which
                                <persName corresp="#p_BG_1">Binaisa</persName> has high hopes from
                            the US. I stuck to a few central themes throughout—stability, aid
                            coordination, and protection of Americans—and generally listened to what
                            President had to say on a wide variety of subjects. Aid matters reported

                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_BG_1">Binaisa</persName>. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BG_1">Binaisa</persName> acts like the man in charge. He
                            is clearly in a big hurry to get on with reconstruction. He is forceful
                            and articulate in presenting his views, yet is receptive to the thoughts
                            of others and acts on new ideas that he likes. He said his ideology is
                            unity and that he considers himself to left of center. This, he said,
                            was an essential for the leader of a Third World country.</p>
                        <p>5. Relations with the US. <persName corresp="#p_BG_1">Binaisa</persName>
                            said he was seeking agreement for Dr. Luyimbazi Zake as his Ambassador
                            to Washington. (Zake was <persName corresp="#p_OM_1">Obote</persName>’s
                            Education Minister and now teaches at a US university. As a fellow
                            Muganda who shares the odium among Baganda of having served <persName
                                corresp="#p_OM_1">Obote</persName>, Zake may be fairly close to
                                <persName corresp="#p_BG_1">Binaisa</persName>.) <persName
                                corresp="#p_BG_1">Binaisa</persName> said he expected soon to have a
                            personal message for President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                >Carter</persName>. He hoped to hear soon about an American
                            Ambassador to Uganda.</p>
                        <p>6. Security. <persName corresp="#p_BG_1">Binaisa</persName> was well
                            informed about security problems in Kampala. He said remnants of
                                <persName corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName>’s army were still being
                            picked up. They had caused some trouble, as have a large number of
                            “thugs” who had been released from prison when Kampala was liberated.
                            Even more serious, he thought, were the black market operators who were
                                <pb n="440" facs="0472" xml:id="pg_440"/>constantly looking for
                            stolen goods to sell. He said black marketeers had stolen or bought arms
                            and uniforms to pose as soldiers. Still worse, he said, soldiers were
                            sometimes still being used to “liberate” houses pointed out to them by
                            black marketeers as homes of <persName corresp="#p_AID_1"
                                >Amin</persName> supporters.</p>
                        <p>7. Stability. I pointed out that Uganda’s image as a country bent on
                            reconstruction had probably suffered from political turmoil that
                            surrounded June 20 change of government. Donors had backed away, waiting
                            for stable conditions to emerge. <persName corresp="#p_BG_1"
                                >Binaisa</persName> said he understood this. He hoped Washington
                            would understand Uganda’s situation. The people had been suppressed for
                            eight years and some turmoil was inevitable. <persName corresp="#p_BG_1"
                                >Binaisa</persName> said he had ordered the greatest restraint in
                            dealing with Baganda who demonstrated about the change of government. He
                            wanted to let people speak out and to preserve human and political
                            rights as far as possible. I assured him that this had not gone
                            unnoticed, particularly the welcome restraint in dealing with Baganda
                            demonstrators.</p>
                        <p>8. Elections. <persName corresp="#p_BG_1">Binaisa</persName> brought up
                            elections. I did not comment. He was critical of those now calling for
                            elections (Kampala 78).<note n="3" xml:id="d171fn3">In telegram 78 from
                                Kampala, July 3, the Embassy reported that a former Minister of

                                Archives, RG 59, Central Foreign Policy File, D790303–1240)</note>
                            Citing practical problems, he said Uganda could not have elections in
                            less than two years. There had been no voter registration since 1961.
                            More than half of those now eligible to vote had never been registered.
                            The old constituencies were inadequate and would have to be
                            withdrawn.</p>
                        <p>9. Political requirements. <persName corresp="#p_BG_1">Binaisa</persName>
                            said his most pressing political requirement is to get consumer goods on
                            the market.</p>
                        <p>10. Relations with Kenya. <persName corresp="#p_BG_1">Binaisa</persName>
                            said he wants and needs Kenya’s help. He said he expected very good
                            cooperation from Kenya and pointed to the extended stay in Nairobi of
                            the Ejalu mission as a sign that things were going well.</p>
                        <p>11. Peace Corps. <persName corresp="#p_BG_1">Binaisa</persName> said he
                            wants the Peace Corps to provide teachers. I said that I was pleased to
                            learn of his interest in the Peace Corps. Pointed out that the Peace
                            Corps could help in areas other than teaching, and suggested we wait a
                            year or so to see where the Peace Corps might best be able to
                            assist.</p>

                            President Moi and the opportunity his visit presented to consult and to
                            share ideas. He recognized that Moi would be meeting with State and
                            Defense officials and key members of Congress. Moi should call, the
                            President said, if he needed his personal help on any matter.</p>
                        <p>This was a time of trial, the President continued, for the democracies of
                            the world. Again he wanted to note his admiration for political
                            developments in Kenya in recent months. The successful holding of
                            elections recently was an encouragement to countries throughout the
                                world.<note n="3" xml:id="d173fn3">Kenyan elections took place on
                                November 8, 1979.</note> We had also watched with great interest
                            Kenyan efforts to improve relations with neighboring Tanzania and
                            Uganda. We had followed closely the economic development of Kenya.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President</hi> noted the comment of President Moi
                            to him during the arrival ceremony that a few years ago one fifth of the
                            receipts for the export of coffee were adequate to pay for the import of
                            Kenya’s petroleum needs.<note n="4" xml:id="d173fn4">For the welcoming
                                remarks of both Presidents <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"

                            Today the cost of petroleum imports was more than the total receipts for
                            coffee exports. Moi had told him of the temporary shortage of grain
                            resulting from adverse weather conditions, and the United States wished
                            to be of assistance with this problem. The President reiterated his
                            appreciation for Kenya’s staunch support of US positions on the hostages
                            in Iran and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. We valued our good
                            relations with Kenya very highly.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="italic">President Moi</hi> expressed his sincere appreciation
                            for the very warm reception that he and his delegation had in the United
                            States. He brought greetings to President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                >Carter</persName> from all the Kenyan people. If it were agreeable
                            to the President, he would first discuss East African and related issues
                            and then US-Kenya bilateral relations.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Tanzania</hi>—The situation in East Africa is very
                            fluid, <hi rend="italic">President Moi</hi> said. He had hoped that the
                            Tanzanian invasion of Uganda would result in greater stability in that
                            country but in fact things had worsened there. There was enormous
                            hostility developing between the Ugandan people and the Tanzanian
                            occupying troops. Kenya had hoped that <persName corresp="#p_NJ_1"
                                >Julius Nyerere</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BG_1"
                                >Binaisa</persName> would ask the UK for police training, and
                            perhaps for training of a new army as well. Regretfully, this had not
                            taken place. Uganda had many Marxists in the present government. There
                            was no reconstruction going on in Uganda because, for example, the
                            revenue from the sale of Uganda’s coffee and tea, which was now being
                            sold through Tanzania, was going into Tanzanian coffers. The Tanzanians
                            argued that the Ugandans must pay for the war and for the occupying
                            Tanzanian soldiers. The Tanzanians had between 25,000 and 30,000 troops
                            in Uganda which cost 6 million pounds monthly. Incidents were increasing
                            and in some villages Tanzanian soldiers had been killed.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                    >Carter</persName></hi> asked if any Tanzanian troops were
                            withdrawing from Uganda. Moi said it was not likely that Julius would
                            withdraw his troops soon.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President</hi> asked if <persName corresp="#p_BG_1"
                                >Binaisa</persName> was independent of <persName corresp="#p_NJ_1"
                                >Nyerere</persName>. Moi said it is impossible for <persName

                            told him to Dar-es-Salaam. Kenya was doing what it could to encourage

                            in Mombasa had been planned, but Moi had had to defer it because of his
                            state visit to West Germany. Moi said he hoped to convene the meeting
                            when he returned from his visit to the United States.</p>

                            Tanzania. Moi replied that he had no problem with an open border; it was
                            Tanzania that had closed the border. Recently he ordered the Kenyan
                            border closed too, however, and he believed this had brought home to
                            Tanzania the problem of closed borders. President <persName

                            opened soon. Moi said he didn’t see that as a likely possibility.
                            Further, even when it is open it won’t be as useful as it was
                            before.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">President Moi</hi> then expressed his concern for the
                            expansion of Tanzanian influence in Africa, e.g. with Mugabe in
                            Zimbabwe, in the Comoros, and with <persName corresp="#p_MHM_1"
                                >Mengistu</persName> in Ethiopia. Moi said many countries in Africa
                            were obtaining arms rather than funds for the economic betterment of
                            their people. He suggested that the US should consider providing
                            economic assistance to only those countries that don’t invest a
                            disproportionate amount of funds in arms. Tanzanian soldiers were
                            currently in Uganda, Seychelles and Mozambique. Further, Zanzibar wants
                            to be separate from the mainland.</p>

                            Kenyan-Somali relations and the threat that Somalia has posed in the

                            President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> said that Moi
                            knew we had opened talks with President Siad. In those talks Siad had

                            bent. Kenya stayed in touch with the Ethiopians to have some idea of the
                            intentions of the Russians.</p>

                            others said he is a puppet of the Soviets. What was the Kenyan view? Moi
                            said that when he visited Ethiopia a year ago <persName
                                corresp="#p_MHM_1">Mengistu</persName> told him and other members of
                            his delegation that he wanted to preserve the identity of Ethiopia. Moi
                            said he also believed Ethiopians would continue to be Ethiopians and
                            would not change. It would take time, however, for Ethiopian nationalism
                            to return as the dominant force in Ethiopia. Moi said he had recently
                            begun to wonder whether he was right in this judgment about the strength
                            of Ethiopian nationalism. The communists were getting a tight grip on
                            certain sectors of Ethiopian society and might soon take over. It was a
                            difficult situation to judge.</p>

                            at the moment but the Sudanese did have serious economic problems and
                            Libya continued to cause trouble. The Saudis were very helpful but were
                            not quick to act. The US played a key role in the Persian Gulf area and
                            if the Saudis were to fall to the Soviets, all the Persian Gulf area and
                            much of Africa would be in danger.</p>

                                    >Carter</persName></hi> asked whether Kenya had good
                            communications with Saudi Arabia. President Moi replied that Kenya did
                            not have any formal agreements but it did maintain good diplomatic
                            relations and a good dialogue with both countries.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Zambia</hi>—<hi rend="italic">Moi</hi> said he told
                            Prime Minister Thatcher that Kaunda should not be left out on a limb.
                            When the Soviets got into a country it was difficult to get them out.
                            Zambia was in a strategically key position. If Zambia bought Russian
                            arms, the East Germans and Cubans would use Zambia as a base to
                            penetrate Zaire and Namibia. The situation in Zimbabwe was still
                            uncertain and Kaunda was still not strong enough to stand alone. Julius
                            was trying to get Kaunda removed. If the UK or the US could give arms to
                            Zambia that would help; and it was not too late to draw Kaunda back from
                            the Soviets. When he told this to Prime Minister Thatcher she said she
                            would send Peter Carrington to Zambia after the elections in Zimbabwe to
                            see what needed to be done. Kaunda was helping Nkomo. Kenya was helping
                            Nkomo too, morally, because Kenya believed that what happened in
                            Zimbabwe would determine what would happen in Namibia. Moi had told
                            Nkomo to form a government of National Unity.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                    >Carter</persName></hi> asked if Moi would like to predict how
                            things would turn out in Zimbabwe. Moi said he hoped things would go <pb
                                n="446" facs="0478" xml:id="pg_446"/>well. It would be a choice
                            between Mugabe and Nkomo. Moi reiterated his view that if the Soviets
                            supplied arms and the US supplied economic assistance to a particular
                            country, the US was strengthening its enemy. Western countries should
                            learn this basic fact.</p>
                        <p>The basic principles of Kenya were unity, peace and love. It was
                            necessary to have all three of these. Israel, for example, must not only
                            be well-armed but must learn to love the Palestinians.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Iraq</hi>—Iraq was a country in between, Moi said. The
                            President asked if Moi had visited Iraq. Moi replied he had been invited
                            but he had not been able to go there yet. The President said we would
                            like to have more normal relations with Iraq but they were
                            reluctant.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Kenyan Facilities</hi>—In principle it was agreeable
                            for the US to use Kenyan facilities, Moi said. The Kenyan Government
                            would appreciate, Moi said, that the word “facilities” is used and not
                            “bases”. The President assured Moi that we would try to be careful and
                            refer only to use of facilities. Moi said that Kenya already shared many
                            things with the US, and in Mombasa, for example, US naval personnel
                            often assisted in the repair of Kenyan naval equipment or vessels. The
                            President asked how relations were between US military forces and
                            Kenya’s during US naval ship visits to Mombasa. Were they friendly? Moi
                            replied that personal relations were excellent and the personnel of our
                            respective military forces were very friendly with one another. They
                            considered themselves comrades in arms.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Kenya’s Problems</hi>—Like other countries in the
                            world, Moi continued, Kenya had a problem today resulting from the rise
                            in oil prices, worldwide inflation, the increase in prices of most
                            imports and the decline in prices of Kenya’s major exports (coffee and
                            tea). The past year had also been difficult for Kenya because of poor
                            weather conditions. As a result there was not enough food this year to
                            feed the people. Kenya usually grew enough maize and wheat to export.
                            Maize was a staple food in Kenya. The decline in agricultural production
                            affected revenues, yet at the same time the government was buying F–5Es
                            which increased Defense expenditures. The result of these several
                            factors was a large increase in the balance of payments gap. He had
                            instructed government departments to cut expenditures wherever possible,
                            even cutting out some services.</p>
                        <p>They were working to increase food production so that next year Kenya
                            would once again be self-sufficient. He had also created a Ministry of
                            Energy, Moi said, to study these problems.</p>
                        <p>Some European countries (UK and Switzerland) had offered to help by
                            writing off some of Kenyan’s debts. He had talked to the Germans about
                            these things and they were seeing how they could help. He estimated the
                            balance of payments gap at $150 million during 1980/81. He needed to
                            cover this gap in order to sustain economic <pb n="447" facs="0479"
                                xml:id="pg_447"/>development in the country and to ensure continuing
                            stability. He was requesting, therefore, an additional $100 million in
                            balance of payments help, rather than the $18 million originally
                            requested. Secondly, he needed help with the existing military <gloss
                                target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> debt of $93 million. He hoped this
                            debt would be waived or rescheduled. If that were difficult, then
                            perhaps some form of other assistance from <gloss target="#t_UNICEF_1"
                                >UNICEF</gloss> or other <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> agencies
                            could be obtained. Those were his problems, Moi said. The people of
                            Kenya were stable and he had their confidence. Without assistance,
                            however, it would be difficult for Kenya in 1980 and therefore he was
                            asking help from his friends.</p>

                            should discuss whether or how payments might be delayed and whether
                            there were other means to manage these problems. It might be possible,
                            for example, for the US to increase its shipments of <gloss

                            that there can be a permanent improvement in Kenyan production of corn
                            and wheat. The US was prepared to share with Kenya the knowledge it had
                            gained of how to improve our agricultural production. The harvests
                            recently had been good.</p>

                            new place to hold the Olympic games. The President asked President Moi
                            to designate one of the members of his delegation to this task. After a
                            brief consultation with other members of his delegation, Moi designated
                            Ambassador Mbogua.</p>

                            supported by about 50 nations which had made firm or at least tentative
                                <pb n="448" facs="0480" xml:id="pg_448"/>statements on this issue.
                            Some countries were not as firm as Kenya on this matter and were waiting
                            to see if the Soviets would withdraw from Afghanistan. The Soviets were
                            having difficulty in Afghanistan, the President commented, in that
                            freedom fighters throughout the country were effective. As a result, the
                            Soviets had continued to send in troops and the US now estimated they
                            had 100,000 soldiers in Afghanistan. Today Afghanistan loyalists
                            controlled several regional towns and the Soviets only controlled the
                            central sector of Afghanistan. We did not believe the Soviets would
                            withdraw their forces. We intended to stand firm and would not send our
                            athletes to Moscow. We hoped that others would also stand firm. We
                            intended to keep in close touch with Kenya as circumstances changed.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President</hi> said he hoped Moi would take the
                            initiative to improve relations with Somalia and Sudan, as well as with
                            Uganda and Tanzania. The recent meeting in Arusha, for example, was
                            helpful. The US would be prepared to assist him in improving his
                            relations with Sadat and the Saudis. He could help us, in return, in
                            improving our relations with Iraq which are difficult because of our
                            involvement in the Israeli-Egypt peace process. The President said he
                            was prepared to encourage greater trade and investment by US firms in
                            Kenya. Such additional investment would provide more jobs. Should Moi
                            desire a special trade mission to facilitate increased investment, the
                            President said Moi should let him know through either his Ambassador or
                            the US Ambassador in Nairobi.</p>
                        <p>Should Moi desire a briefing on intelligence matters or on the
                            President’s relations with other leaders in the Middle East, Pakistan or
                            India, he should send the President a message. The President added that
                            he intended to take Moi’s advice and to look into keeping Kaunda from
                            depending solely on the Soviets for weapons. He would further explore
                            this matter both directly and with the UK. We were optimistic that in
                            another week or ten days there would be a successful election in
                            Zimbabwe. We believe such an event would help break the impasse in
                            Namibia as well as contribute to improvements in the situation in
                            Angola. We planned to share with President Moi whatever information we
                            had on these subjects and would be seeking his advice.</p>

                            said that the rate of population growth in Kenya may well be one of
                            Kenya’s most serious problems. The President chided Moi that it would be
                            difficult for Moi as the father of seven children to take the lead in
                            such a campaign. Moi responded that in fact he had publicly urged
                            Kenyans not to produce children that couldn’t be taken care of. The
                            President asked Moi if he had discussed this issue with any other
                            governments. Moi said he had looked at what had been done to control
                            population <pb n="449" facs="0481" xml:id="pg_449"/>in Singapore. The
                            President said Prime Minister Lee had done a good job but he had a small
                            country.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1"

                            to convene a conference on population matters in Kenya. This might
                            stimulate interest in the problem in Kenya. The US would be willing to
                            help to sponsor such a conference. Moi and other members of his
                            delegation indicated an interest in this proposal.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President</hi> noted that even Catholic countries
                            such as Mexico were becoming concerned by the problem. Moi said
                            Catholics in Kenya were willing to cooperate in population programs. The
                            President commented that Lee in Singapore used penalties and rewards to
                            cut down population growth but that such a system would be difficult for
                            Kenya because Kenya is so large. There might be other ways to tackle the
                            problem.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LWJ_1">Le
                                    Melle</persName></hi> commented that what Kenya has needed is
                            policy leadership in this field. Kenya was one of the first countries to
                            establish in 1966 a population council. Now that President Moi was
                            giving this problem his personal leadership it was being taken up at the
                            working levels. Moi said it was difficult to start a new program like
                            this because of the current financial difficulties. He had also found
                            that people won’t listen to parents of large families but will listen to
                            young couples who after having one or two children stopped having more.
                            They are the most effective spokesmen for population control. The
                            President commented that he had been governor of a southern state with a
                            high birth rate. He found the most effective slogan was the phrase “we
                            want every child to be a wanted child”. If this problem is handled
                            sensitively an effective program can be operated. Mrs. Gandhi in India
                            had initiated a very rigid program, perhaps too rigid. China was also
                            working on the problem. There was financial assistance available from
                            international organizations for support of a population program.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President</hi> closed the meeting by noting that
                            some of the points covered could be discussed in greater length at

                            reminded, before the dinner if Moi had any points he wished to raise as
                            a result of his day of talks.</p>

                            socialism and Tanzania’s designs on Uganda, Seychelles, Comoros and
                            Zambia. The Kenyan Attorney General suggested we use our influence with
                                <persName corresp="#p_BG_1">Binaisa</persName> to ease out the
                            Tanzanian presence in Uganda.<note n="2" xml:id="d174fn2"><persName
                                    corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> wrote “We should do this”
                                in the left margin.</note> Moi also repeated his concern about
                            Soviet arms supply to Zambia and his hope that the West could provide
                            more support to Zambia so Kaunda would not have to turn to the Soviets.
                            He said he relied upon us to restrain <persName corresp="#p_SBM_1">Siad

                        <p>Moi gave Harold Brown a shopping list (APCs, artillery, air defense
                            missiles, <gloss target="#t_C130_1">C–130</gloss>’s, additional F–5
                            airplanes and navigational aides). Harold told Moi we were aware of
                            Kenya’s economic problems and would therefore want to consult closely on
                            military priorities. He noted that debt forgiveness presents problems
                            for us but said he hoped we could find a way to help. He proposed more
                            lenient terms for <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> credits in
                            FY–1980 and FY–1981 and said he hoped that $20 million <gloss

                            balance of payments problem. Moi said that the morale of Kenya’s armed
                            forces has been raised by the prospect of our joint use of their
                            facilities and that Kenya is proud to be our partner.<note n="3"

                                supported the idea of an international peacekeeping force, thought
                                an East African summit would be useful, believed that <persName
                                    corresp="#p_BG_1">Binaisa</persName> needed to work with the
                                National Consultative Council, and was concerned that his effort to
                                create an independent force loyal only to him would likely backfire.

                        <p>2. I went through points <gloss target="#t_reftel_1">reftel</gloss> with
                                <persName corresp="#p_BG_1">Binaisa</persName> at State House,
                            Entebbe, late afternoon March 17. I emphasized that I had instructions
                            to point out concerns in Washington about <persName corresp="#p_BG_1"
                                >Binaisa</persName>’s apparent efforts to create an independent
                            force loyal to him. I said the US is concerned about the possibilities
                            of unilateral Kenyan involvement in some form as this issue more than
                            anything else has stirred some National Consultative Council members to
                            think of acting against him. Roger Channel message<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d175fn3">Not found.</note> cited <gloss target="#t_reftel_1"
                                >reftel</gloss> did not arrive but I mentioned some specifics of
                            alleged Kenyan involvement and <persName corresp="#p_BG_1"
                                >Binaisa</persName>’s own security force that I have read or heard
                            about. In fact, I pretty well explored the limits of possible security
                            activities <persName corresp="#p_BG_1">Binaisa</persName> might be
                            undertaking on his own behalf. This drew no reaction at all.</p>
                        <p>2. The other point I emphasized was the necessity of <persName
                                corresp="#p_BG_1">Binaisa</persName>’s working with the <gloss
                                target="#t_NCC_1">NCC</gloss>. I said that it had been demonstrated
                            that a majority of the <gloss target="#t_NCC_1">NCC</gloss> has so far
                            not favored dismissing him. In the interests of Uganda’s stability and
                            his own position he should consider how this sentiment can be turned to
                            constructive advantage.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_BG_1">Binaisa</persName> heard me out on these
                            points, then launched into a jumble of details. He wondered why
                                <persName corresp="#p_OM_1">Obote</persName> had chosen this time to
                            announce his candidacy. He wanted to know why Tanzania had suddenly
                            decided to dump 700 Ugandan POWs on him with only four days notice (the
                            POWs are at Mwanza). To my suggestion that his unannounced trip to
                            Nairobi had created serious tensions, Banaisa asked, “Am I not a free
                            agent?” I said that was the essential point; in the context of the
                            interim arrangements he was definitely not a free agent. He said his
                            ministers come and go as they please, so why shouldn’t he? Banaisa <pb
                                n="452" facs="0484" xml:id="pg_452"/>said he followed the point on
                            working with the <gloss target="#t_NCC_1">NCC</gloss>. He acknowledged
                            that he receives help from the Democratic Party. He said he has been
                            requested to attend a “secret” <gloss target="#t_NCC_1">NCC</gloss>
                            meeting on March 18 at which a no-confidence motion may arise.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_BG_1">Binaisa</persName> said he could do
                            nothing now about a Commonwealth or other international force. The
                            Cabinet, he said, is firmly against it since his March 10–11 meeting
                            with Moi.<note n="4" xml:id="d175fn4">In telegram 68015 to Nairobi,
                                March 14, the Department voiced concern over reports that during May
                                10–11 meetings, Moi may have offered to supply <persName
                                    corresp="#p_BG_1">Binaisa</persName> with weapons to arm a
                                militia that would be loyal to him. The Department, instead,
                                advocated urging <persName corresp="#p_BG_1">Binaisa</persName> to
                                work with the <gloss target="#t_NCC_1">NCC</gloss> and rely upon an
                                international peacekeeping force in the event of a <gloss

                                RG 59, Central Foreign Policy File, D800131–0180)</note> He said
                            there can now be an international force only if the word comes from
                                <persName corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nyerere</persName> as no one will send
                            in troops unless <persName corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nyerere</persName> invites
                            them. <persName corresp="#p_BG_1">Binaisa</persName> asked for help from
                            the US in persuading <persName corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nyerere</persName> to
                            move in this direction.</p>
                        <p>5. Absent an international force, <persName corresp="#p_BG_1"
                                >Binaisa</persName> seemed to think Uganda could squeak by. He
                            expects all Tanzanian soldiers to be gone by September, by which time,
                            he said, Uganda’s army and police should be able to maintain security.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BG_1">Binaisa</persName> sees a role for an
                            elections-monitoring force (I will comment on this aspect of <gloss
                                target="#t_reftel_1">reftel</gloss> separately)<note n="5"
                                xml:id="d175fn5">In telegram 724 from Kampala, March 19, the Embassy
                                advocated an election-monitoring force as an alternative to an
                                international peacekeeping force. Such a force “would be tied to a
                                specific objective, rather than involved in an open-ended
                                ʻpeace-keeping’ operation.” (National Archives, RG 59, Central

                            political and constitutional aspects of advancing the date of

                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_BG_1">Binaisa</persName> indicated that his
                            relationship with <persName corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nyerere</persName> is at
                            an end. He said he will not go to Tanzania again because <persName
                                corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nyerere</persName> might lock him up as he did
                                <persName corresp="#p_LY_1">Lule</persName>. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BG_1">Binaisa</persName> does not expect that there will
                            be another East African summit and said he would not want to attend one
                            while <persName corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nyerere</persName> is treating him
                            “like a little schoolboy.” He is tired of <persName corresp="#p_NJ_1"
                                >Nyerere</persName>’s dictates and wants to get out of the way
                            entirely. He was visibly irked that Tanzanian Minister of State
                            Shekilango had just arrived, probably with another message from
                                <persName corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nyerere</persName>. He was pleased to be
                            able to keep Shekilango waiting for about an hour while we talked. He
                            said the underlying problem with Tanzania is ideological. Tanzanian envy
                            of Uganda’s relatively greater wealth is an additional complication.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_BG_1">Binaisa</persName> had a good deal to say
                            about plots against him by <persName corresp="#p_OM_1">Obote</persName>
                            and his followers. He said that if he is attacked he will not “turn the
                            other cheek.” He will stay and fight. He said he has no plans to leave
                            the country. “I will be killed here. I will do no such thing as
                                <persName corresp="#p_LY_1">Lule</persName> did.”</p>
                        <p><pb n="453" facs="0485" xml:id="pg_453"/>8. Comment. There was little in
                            today’s presentation I have not said to <persName corresp="#p_BG_1"
                                >Binaisa</persName> before. Fact of instructions, which I
                            emphasized, added helpful weight but I am not optimistic that <persName
                                corresp="#p_BG_1">Binaisa</persName> will be much influenced. Others
                            have tried to get across more or less the same message without apparent
                            effect.</p>
                        <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_BG_1">Binaisa</persName>’s stated determination
                            to fight back if attacked and his refusal to rise to the bait and
                            comment on his own security arrangements lead me to suspect that he has
                            put something together to defend himself. He knows what the US thinks
                            about his plans and may be suspicious that the US will interfere if we
                            find out for certain what he is up to.</p>
                        <p>10. The March 17 meeting may have provided some new insights into how
                                <persName corresp="#p_BG_1">Binaisa</persName> sees things. I think
                            it is probable that he sees things in the following way: <persName
                                corresp="#p_OM_1">Obote</persName>’s supporters, who now include
                                <persName corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nyerere</persName>, are determined that
                                <persName corresp="#p_OM_1">Obote</persName> should return and run
                            the country without elections. <persName corresp="#p_OM_1"
                                >Obote</persName> is the one who matters. Politicians in the <gloss
                                target="#t_NCC_1">NCC</gloss> are largely irrelevant. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BG_1">Binaisa</persName> believes that he has limited
                            time to set the country irreversibly on a course towards elections.
                                <persName corresp="#p_OM_1">Obote</persName> will revive a socialist
                            dictatorship. <persName corresp="#p_BG_1">Binaisa</persName> is the only
                            hope for free enterprise and democracy. The <gloss target="#t_NCC_1"
                                >NCC</gloss> cannot be trusted to uphold democratic principles. The
                                <gloss target="#t_NCC_1">NCC</gloss> will not be around to help when
                                <persName corresp="#p_OM_1">Obote</persName>’s forces move against
                            him. <persName corresp="#p_BG_1">Binaisa</persName> therefore has to be
                            prepared to stand on his own. He believes he represents the will of the
                            great majority of Ugandans and that he has their interests at heart.</p>
                        <p>11. If this is indeed how <persName corresp="#p_BG_1">Binaisa</persName>
                            sees things, adjurations to him about avoiding confrontation will fall
                            on deaf ears. Probably the best we can hope for is that he will reduce
                            his isolation by cooperating more with those whom he thinks are not
                            after his hide, but he is likely to see confrontation with the rest of
                            the <gloss target="#t_NCC_1">NCC</gloss> as inevitable and even
                            necessary.</p>

                        <p>On 3 April, US and Kenyan negotiators initialed, ad referendum on
                            governments, the 10-year agreement that gives us the access to Kenyan
                            facilities we have sought.<note n="2" xml:id="d176fn2">In telegram 6423
                                from Nairobi, April 3, the Embassy transmitted the text of the
                                initialed ad referendum agreement. (National Archives, RG 59,
                                Central Foreign Policy File, D800167–0082)</note> It calls for the
                            creation of a US liaison office to manage aspects of access, and allows
                            us to make needed improvements to Kenyan facilities. The “cost” to us
                            for this liberal access is $10 million in <gloss target="#t_ESF_1"
                                >ESF</gloss> for the next two years and $6 million in <gloss

                            support now programmed for Kenya. The final agreement is very close to
                            our initial draft, except that it provides for a “status of forces”
                            arrangement rather than exclusive US legal jurisdiction over US
                            personnel we initially proposed. So as not to embarrass the Kenyans, we
                            should not publicize this achievement until after it has been formally
                            accepted by both governments, and even then we should keep publicity at
                            a low key. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VC_1">Vance</persName> will

                        <p>2. We are concerned by recent developments in Uganda, believing the
                            country needs to put political turmoil behind it and concentrate on its
                            increasingly serious economic problems. <persName corresp="#p_BG_1"
                                >Binaisa</persName>’s move to oust Ojok now was clearly ill advised
                            and obviously poorly executed. Judging by Radio Kampala and foreign
                            press reports, it seems to have cost him his job. We hold no brief for
                                <persName corresp="#p_BG_1">Binaisa</persName> or any other Ugandan
                            leader. We want the people of Uganda to have an opportunity, after eight
                            years, to decide who will govern them and we want that process to be
                            fair and acceptable to the international community. Our principal
                            concern then is that the reported assumption of power by the “military
                            commission” and <persName corresp="#p_BG_1">Binaisa</persName>’s seeming
                            dismissal not interrupt progress towards national elections.</p>
                        <p>3. While the situation in Uganda is still confused, it is clear the
                            Tanzanians hold one of the keys to future developments there. We agree
                            with Kampala’s suggestion and approach to <persName corresp="#p_NJ_1"
                                >Nyerere</persName> would be useful and suggest Embassy Dar es

                                >Nyerere</persName> as soon as possible:<note n="3" xml:id="d177fn3"
                                >In telegram 2734 from Dar es Salaam, May 13, the Embassy responded
                                to this suggestion by saying that any efforts toward <persName
                                    corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nyerere</persName> had been overtaken by
                                events and Embassy staff believed that <persName corresp="#p_NJ_1"
                                    >Nyerere</persName> was “caught completely off-guard not only by
                                    <persName corresp="#p_BG_1">Binaisa</persName>’s move against
                                Ojok, but more importantly, by Ojok’s quick marshalling of support.”

                        <p>—We are concerned by recent developments in Uganda, as we believe all of
                            Uganda’s friends are.</p>
                        <p><pb n="456" facs="0488" xml:id="pg_456"/>—Uganda needs to put its
                            political disputes behind it and concentrate on its very serious
                            economic problems.</p>
                        <p>—We supported the announcement of early elections believing they would
                            help in this process and produce a government which would have the
                            support of the people and the international community.</p>
                        <p>—We are concerned that the reported military take over of the Ugandan
                            Government may lead to increased instability and interrupt the progress
                            towards early elections.</p>
                        <p>—We hope that those friends of Uganda who have some influence will do
                            what they can to facilitate implementation of the political process
                            agreed at Mombasa without further delay or bloodshed.<note n="4"

                        <p>4. For Nairobi and Khartoum: We believe the Mombasa summit meeting gives
                            both Presidents Moi and Nimeiri a role to play in this situation.
                            Embassies should approach host governments at an appropriately high
                            level to register our concern about recent developments in Uganda and
                            our hope that all the Mombasa summit participants will continue to make
                            known their support of early elections in Uganda.<note n="5"

                                the responsibility of Tanzania.” He also proposed a conference “at

                            What is unstated but obvious in this situation is <persName
                                corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nyerere</persName>’s peculiar responsibility and
                            vulnerability with regard to the Ojok-<persName corresp="#p_OM_1"
                                >Obote</persName> connection. I thought <persName corresp="#p_NJ_1"
                                >Nyerere</persName> had recognized how costly, politically and
                            economically, his Ugandan adventure had become. Mombasa looked like the
                            beginning of his withdrawal from this exposure and the possible opening
                            of a new East African era. <persName corresp="#p_NJ_1"
                                >Nyerere</persName> scarcely needs the onus of being the mettre en

                            there is a presumption of [garble—guilt already]. We give you license to
                            play this piece of music as you will but as I read the foregoing it
                            seemed a bit pale. <persName corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nyerere</persName> may
                            not be able to do anything about this but if anyone can, he can.</p>

                            see attacks as confirming their suspicions about hostile activities in
                            neighboring countries. Military Commission Chairman <persName

                            hostility by Kenya could alter the political character of Uganda and
                            perhaps even East Africa. Outside influences will not be allowed to
                            interfere with elections which will go ahead on schedule as closely as
                            possible. End summary.</p>

                        <p>4. Attacks in last few days on border posts, allegedly by ex-<persName
                                corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName> soldiers, was the principal topic
                            raised by Ugandans. Attacks were cited as evidence of support by Sudan
                            and Kenya for efforts of dissident Ugandan exiles, including <persName
                                corresp="#p_AID_1">Amin</persName> elements, to disrupt elections.
                            To news of attacks in the northwest <persName corresp="#p_MP_1"
                                >Muwanga</persName> added reports of attacks in the east near the
                            Kenya border. In one incident fifteen on the Ugandan side had been
                            killed. He believes all the attacks were coordinated. The Military
                            Commission’s information is sparse but the threat can probably be
                            contained. A diplomatic initiative includes expressing concern to
                            Ambassadors of Zaire and Sudan. An envoy from Zaire is expected and
                                <persName corresp="#p_MP_1">Muwanga</persName> thinks <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> will be cooperative.</p>
                        <p>5. While Allimadi was hopeful that some form of regional cooperation can
                            be salvaged (he discussed contacts with Sudan and Kenya in a business as
                            usual fashion) <persName corresp="#p_MP_1">Muwanga</persName> was
                            pessimistic, warning that relations with Kenya are in very bad shape.
                            “Kenya is driving this country to a precipice that might cause Uganda to
                            have a different political face. We are being driven into a corner.
                            Because of Kenya we have to spend more on guns and security.” (We
                            understood <persName corresp="#p_MP_1">Muwanga</persName> to be saying
                            that Uganda might have to abandon its basically Western <pb n="458"

                            to be thinking of major changes throughout East Africa). Smuggling by
                            Kenyans and the training in arms of Ugandan dissidents are the principal
                            problems. Kenya won’t cooperate because it is obsessed with <persName
                                corresp="#p_OM_1">Obote</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NJ_1"
                                >Nyerere</persName>. “Kenya believes every lie because it has no one
                            here to learn the truth.” <persName corresp="#p_MP_1">Muwanga</persName>
                            has refrained from talking publicly because he does not want to make a
                            difficult situation impossible. Uganda could hurt Kenya, if necessary,
                            by closing the border. Uganda could also take care of itself in a fight
                            with Kenya but <persName corresp="#p_MP_1">Muwanga</persName> is not
                            planning any action.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_WL_1">Walker</persName> wondered how the US
                            could help since Sudan and Kenya, along with Uganda, are friends. In
                            response to an earlier Ugandan request the US had received assurances
                            from Sudan and Kenya that they are not helping Ugandan dissidents.<note

                                that the Sudanese Ambassador to Tanzania had “described in

                            <persName corresp="#p_MP_1">Muwanga</persName> was skeptical, “these
                            assurances are ones to which we attach little importance.” Uganda’s
                            information, he said is too good to believe otherwise. He had prior
                            knowledge of the attacks on the border posts. “We have known for certain

                            particularly interested because free and fair elections will put them in

                                <persName corresp="#p_OM_1">Obote</persName> that we had tried to
                            stay neutral during elections between the several parties; <persName
                                corresp="#p_OM_1">Obote</persName> said yes you did and you were
                            successful. Continued that I would be less than frank, however, if I did
                            not now tell him that many of those most knowledgeable about African
                            affairs in the U.S. believed that an <persName corresp="#p_OM_1"
                                >Obote</persName> government would be the strongest government in
                            Uganda and, therefore, have the best chance of leading Ugandans to a
                            better life.</p>
                        <pb n="462" facs="0494" xml:id="pg_462"/>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_OM_1">Obote</persName> said he was very grateful
                            for President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>’s letter
                            and for my comments. He wanted me to know, however, that he was somewhat
                            appalled by the problems facing Uganda. He had spent a full day at the
                            Ministry of Finance and things are in terrible shape. He was also
                            distressed by the civil service. There are many in the civil service,
                                <persName corresp="#p_OM_1">Obote</persName> continued, who are
                            corrupt, but whom he will have to retain in government for a while. It
                            will take time to train men to staff a reformed civil service. I
                            interrupted to offer U.S. assistance in training civil servants in
                            various areas, either in Uganda or in the U.S. Offered to have <gloss
                                target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> Director Buck sit down with <persName
                                corresp="#p_OM_1">Obote</persName>’s Minister of Planning Sam Odaka
                            to see how we might be of help. <persName corresp="#p_OM_1"
                                >Obote</persName> was very grateful for this offer and concurred in
                            my arranging such a meeting.</p>
                        <p>5. Commented that Uganda had received quite good final report from the
                            Commonwealth observers. <persName corresp="#p_OM_1">Obote</persName>
                            said he wanted me know that he felt some of the allegations against
                            Military Commission Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MP_1">Paulo
                                Muwanga</persName> in the foreign press were unfair. When <persName
                                corresp="#p_MP_1">Muwanga</persName> found incompetence in the
                            staging of the elections in Kampala that bordered on subversion, he
                            over-reacted by issuing his edict taking from the Electoral Commission
                            the authority to report vote tallys. <persName corresp="#p_OM_1"
                                >Obote</persName> said he told <persName corresp="#p_MP_1"
                                >Muwanga</persName> he had made an error and although that edict was
                            not rescinded, it was not enforced and the next day <persName
                                corresp="#p_MP_1">Muwanga</persName> publicly turned back to the
                            Electoral Commission the authority to collate and report the returns.
                            Secondly, Electoral Commission had erred in announcing on its own the
                            extension of the period of voting to December 11. Electoral Commission
                            did not have the legal authority to do so and, therefore, <persName
                                corresp="#p_MP_1">Muwanga</persName>’s edict, although ill advised,
                            did legalize the Commission’s extension. Thirdly, Ssekono’s order to
                            polling stations to not begin counting the votes until after the polls
                            were closed on December 11 was apparently not received by all election
                            officials. Therefore, some early counting did begin and some polls
                            apparently did not open or were late in opening on December 11. This led
                            to partial returns beginning to come to Kampala while the election was
                            still in progress in some constituencies. <persName corresp="#p_OM_1"
                                >Obote</persName> could not explain how DP could have announced the
                            number of seats it claimed to have won around noon on December 11 before
                            the polls had even closed officially. There were also several other
                            discrepancies he could not explain but which he was looking into. For
                            example, in the Masaka area there were 80,000 more ballots delivered by
                            Ssekono to the constituencies there than there were people officially
                            registered. <gloss target="#t_UPC_1">UPC</gloss> intended to look into
                            cases where it felt its candidates had been badly treated and it would
                            accept the decision of the courts whether it went for <gloss
                                target="#t_UPC_1">UPC</gloss> or against <gloss target="#t_UPC_1"
                                >UPC</gloss>. He hoped the other parties would do the same.
                                <persName corresp="#p_OM_1">Obote</persName> concluded his remarks
                            on the election by saying when he had been at the Embassy November 5 and
                            viewed our schematic dia<pb n="463" facs="0495" xml:id="pg_463"/>gram of
                            how the various parties had fared, he thought of such a diagram for
                            Uganda today. <gloss target="#t_UPC_1">UPC</gloss> had done well in the
                            north, the east, and some part of the west, but not well at all in the
                            south. This was a problem that would have to be faced by <gloss
                                target="#t_UPC_1">UPC</gloss> if there was to be a unified Uganda,
                            and he intended to work on it.</p>
                        <p>6. Told <persName corresp="#p_OM_1">Obote</persName> that DP and <gloss
                                target="#t_UPM_1">UPM</gloss> officials had sought US out to
                            complain of election malpractices. Stressed to <persName
                                corresp="#p_OM_1">Obote</persName> that we urged these officials, as
                                <persName corresp="#p_OM_1">Obote</persName> himself had outlined in
                            his inaugural speech, to follow legal procedures to seek redress where
                            they felt their candidates had a case. We emphasized that if a party
                            seeks judicial review on a constituency by constituency basis that it
                            was not then consistent to refuse to accept the election in toto. We had
                            urged, therefore, that DP and <gloss target="#t_UPM_1">UPM</gloss>
                            candidates who had won take their seats in the National Assembly and we
                            were pleased to see that they were apparently going to do so.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_OM_1">Obote</persName> ended the meeting by
                            saying he would be looking to friends to help Uganda in the months
                            ahead. He was grateful for the rapid pledges of support from the <gloss
                                target="#t_EEC_1">EEC</gloss>, Commonwealth nations, and others. He
                            said he wanted me to know that he and his government would do the best
                            job that they could.</p>
                        <p>8. Addendum. Have made a request for appointment with <persName
                                corresp="#p_MP_1">Muwanga</persName> but have not yet had it
                            confirmed. Did not discuss, therefore, with Obote Muwanga’s request for
                            assistance for an expanded militia.</p>
                        <p>9. Comment. As the foregoing suggests, this meeting with <persName
                                corresp="#p_OM_1">Obote</persName> was very cordial. Ephraim Kamuntu
                            is a friend and neighbor and it was encouraging to me that he was
                            sitting at <persName corresp="#p_OM_1">Obote</persName>’s right hand.
                            (Kamuntu had telephoned the house last night to discuss a social get
                            together and inter alia expressed the hope that I would continue on as
                            Ambassador under our new President. Said I hoped I would too.) The
                            rapidity with which <persName corresp="#p_OM_1">Obote</persName>
                            received me was also encouraging. Believed the election brouhaha is now
                            behind us and we are well embarked on a good relationship with the new
                            regime.</p>
