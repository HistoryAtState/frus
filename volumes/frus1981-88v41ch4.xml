                    1981–1989, Volume XLI</p>
                <p>In preparing this volume, the editors made extensive use of Presidential papers
                    and other White House records at the Reagan Library. Within the Reagan Library’s
                    collection, <persName corresp="#p_GMA_1">Michael Guhin</persName>’s files, the
                    National Security Council Subject File, <persName corresp="#p_BRC_2">Ralph
                        Bledsoe</persName>’s records of the Domestic Policy Council, and a copy of
                    the <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">George P. Shultz</persName> Papers organized by
                    subject were the most helpful.</p>
                <p>The records of the Department of State were another important source. The
                    Department’s central files contain both cable traffic as well as key memoranda.
                    The Department’s lot files were particularly useful, especially when looking for
                    inter-bureau memoranda regarding whaling, the ozone layer, <gloss
                        target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>, and population control. Two Assistant
                    Secretaries of State for Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs, <persName
                        corresp="#p_AE_1">Elliott Abrams</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SR_1"
                        >Richard Schifter</persName>, both have voluminous lot files. The lot files
                    for Deputy Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">William Clark</persName>,
                        <persName corresp="#p_DKW_1">Kenneth Dam</persName>, and <persName
                        corresp="#p_WJC_1">John Whitehead</persName> contained valuable
                    documentation.</p>
                <p>Research for this volume also involved examining records from the Department of
                    Defense, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the
                    Vice Presidential Materials at the <persName corresp="#p_BGHW_1">George H.W.
                        Bush</persName> Library. Some material from the Agency for International
                    Development is already declassified and available at the National Archives and
                    Records Administration at College Park in Record Group 286. The Office of the
                    Historian was also able to gain access to the <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1"
                        >Alexander M. Haig</persName> Papers at the Library of Congress.</p>
                <p>Researchers will find records in Department of State lot files helpful. Lot
                    90D327 contains most of the records from the United Nations Third World
                    Conference on Women in Nairobi, and Lot 92D207 has several boxes with
                    information about the <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>
                    administration’s policy regarding acid rain.</p>
                <p>Almost all of this documentation has been made available for use in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series thanks to the consent of the
                    agencies mentioned, the assistance of their staffs, and especially the
                    cooperation and support of the National Archives and Records Administration.</p>
                <p>In addition to the paper files cited below, a growing number of documents are
                    available on the Internet. The Office of the Historian maintains a list of these
                    Internet resources on its website and encourages readers to consult that site on
                    a regular basis.</p>

                            about 100,000 tons of Title II commodities valued at about $18 million
                            has been approved for African countries, largely refugee relief (Chad,
                            Rwanda, Somalia and others) and drought assistance (Cape Verde,
                            Mauritania, Mozambique, etc). <gloss target="#t_FFP_1">FFP</gloss>
                            expects that an additional 65,000 tons of commodities will be required
                            to meet refugee and drought relief needs during the remainder of FY 83.

                            forthcoming with permits for foreigners to travel to the field. From the
                            Ethiopian point of view this may have been an indiscretion. Ground and
                            air travellers saw evidence of drought but also clear evidence that food
                            crops were available.</p>
                        <p>The movement of refugees has begun to reach the Ethiopian border with
                            border police counts rising from the 12–15 people the past three months
                            to 100 or more per day. AmEmbassy reports that water is in <pb

                            fighting (as noted above) and the onset of the rainy season in Ethiopia
                            are making travel difficult for refugees at present, but this may only
                            increase the influx later. The donor community does not seem prepared at
                            present to meet a large refugee influx; <gloss target="#t_WFP_1"

                            there is still disagreement on whether the prople involved are fleeing

                            considerable discussion. <persName corresp="#p_ELS_1">Larry
                                Eagleburger</persName> asked us to write this short memo summarizing
                            the issues and proposing recommendations.</p>
                        <pb facs="0623" n="577" xml:id="pg_577"/>
                        <p>The issues are: (1) Should we exclude Angola, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and
                            Tanzania from such a package? (2) Can we be assured that the food will
                            reach the truly needy? (3) Should the President be involved? and (4)
                            Depending on the answers to the above, do we really have a viable
                            package for southern Africa or should we approach the problem country by
                            country? My views are:</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Involving the President:</hi> To take the easiest
                            first, there is agreement now in the building that the President should
                            not be involved. Whether we exclude or include the politically sensitive
                            countries, controversy can ensue and we should protect the President
                            from this. Also, the package is small and we would be straining to wrest
                            much diplomatic mileage from it. In addition, we’ve not yet received
                            formal requests for assistance from Lesotho, Botswana, Swaziland, Zaire
                            or Zimbabwe.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Food for Political Purposes:</hi> The U.S.
                            Government’s long-standing policy is to try to isolate humanitarian and
                            emergency food aid under Title II from political considerations. We are
                            currently supplying food to Ethiopia and Poland. Exceptions to this
                            policy should be made only on a case by case basis, and only when there
                            are compelling reasons since use of food for political purposes arouses
                            strong public opposition. Denying humanitarian food aid is usually a
                            measure of last resort in our dealings with individual countries. In
                            this context:</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Angola:</hi>
                            <gloss target="#t_UNICEF_1">UNICEF</gloss> has formally requested us to
                            supply an additional 9,600 <gloss target="#t_MT_1">MT</gloss> of blended
                            fortified food to their program which feeds 163,000 displaced mothers
                            and young children. We’ve supported this program since 1977. The food is
                            given directly to recipients at government feeding stations; it’s a
                            nutritious speciality product and is not related to filling Angola’s
                            overall food deficit.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mozambique:</hi> Here we’re proposing to increase
                            Mozambique’s already approved 25,195 metric ton Title II program by
                            16,815 tons. We’ve supplied Title II food to Mozambique for emergency
                            purposes off and on since 1976. The food in this case is distributed
                            through private retailers and government cooperatives at prevailing
                            prices. Some also is distributed free to the hard core needy by the
                            government. Mozambique has officially requested food aid from the
                            U.S.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Zimbabwe:</hi> To date we’ve received no request from
                            Zimbabwe although the government is preparing a large appeal to the
                            donors for a special relief program for the hardest hit families in the
                            communal lands.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Tanzania:</hi> We’ve already approved a PL 480 Title I
                            program for Tanzania. There’s no proposal for an increase for Tanzania
                            in the $25 million add-on.</p>
                        <p>Given the above, I recommend that we proceed now with Angola and
                            Mozambique, since there’s been no change in our present relations <pb
                                facs="0624" n="578" xml:id="pg_578"/> with these countries which
                            would warrant reversing present policy. In fact, this increased food aid
                            could be marginally useful as support for our current policy initiatives
                            in both countries. On Zimbabwe, I recommend that we act on this program
                            when a request is received in light of both our long-standing policy on
                            Title II and the review which <persName corresp="#p_ELS_1">Larry
                                Eagleburger</persName> is overseeing on our ability to use
                            diplomatic tools to build support for U.S. positions at the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Does the Food Get to the Needy?</hi> Without going
                            country by country, the answer is basically yes. <gloss
                                target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> has recently reviewed the Mozambique
                            program and finds it well-run. We believe <gloss target="#t_UNICEF_1"
                                >UNICEF</gloss>’s management in Angola is adequate. In Zaire, we may
                            work through <gloss target="#t_WFP_1">WFP</gloss> in Shaba Province and
                            there may be problems of mismanagement here as in other Zairian
                            programs. In other countries, our <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>
                            Missions can monitor distribution.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Do We Need a Package Approach?</hi> Absent a
                            presidential initiative, should not assistance be allocated case by
                            case? This approach would allow exact needs to be better identified,
                            allow individual handling of red flags through consultations on the
                                <persName corresp="#p_HAA_1">Hill</persName>, and permit a better
                            examination of political considerations. We can announce that we’ve
                            approved an additional $25 million for southern Africa and that we will
                            be allocating it to specific countries over time as the needs are
                            quantified and requests received and reviewed.</p>
                        <p>As a final note, the attached memo does not address your broader question
                            of how we use our food surpluses more effectively and flexibly in our
                            foreign policy. This is a difficult issue with ramifications which range
                            from the minutely technical to the grandly moral. The relevant bureaus,
                            including <gloss target="#t_SP_1">S/P</gloss>, should analyze this
                            question for you and identify options.</p>

                                xml:id="d209fn3">Undated, drafted on November 18, attached but not
                                printed.</note> It clearly conveys the idea that most of the
                            problems of the poor stem from a lack of social services. I thought that
                            notion was obsolete by now.</p>
                        <p>I believe our basic theme should be as follows:</p>
                        <p>1. People can meet their basic human needs when they are earning adequate
                            incomes through productive employment.</p>
                        <p>2. A.I.D.’s preeminent objective is to increase employment and incomes
                            through increasing productivity.</p>
                        <p>3. Meeting this objective will require action in a number of areas, e.g.,
                            improved health, enhanced skills and greater efficiency in the use of
                            energy.</p>
                        <pb facs="0629" n="583" xml:id="pg_583"/>
                        <p>4. The best means of enhancing productivity are through:</p>
                        <quote><p>a. Changes in economic policy which emphasize comparative
                                advantage and greater efficiency in the use of resources;</p>
                            <p>b. Reliance on competitive market forces and the private sector;</p>
                            <p>c. Creation and adaptation of new technologies, and;</p>
                            <p>d. Establishment of systems, processes and institutions which ensure
                                that a, b and c above are a continuous effort.</p></quote>
                        <p>A side issue in the paper is the goal of “achieving basic stabilization
                            and attacking financial disequilibrium.” I suppose this has become a
                            goal because so many Missions have become party to, in one way or
                            another, <gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss> stabilization programs.
                            Financial stability, like political stability, is a required
                            pre-condition for development but isn’t a development goal. That we use
                                <gloss target="#t_ESF_1">ESF</gloss> to promote stabilization isn’t
                            a reason for including it as a goal any more than it would be for
                            including political stability as a goal.</p>
                        <p>Also, one does not “attack hunger.” Hunger is the result of inadequate
                            employment and incomes or lack of agricultural productivity or both. We
                            can “attack hunger” by straightforward dole feeding but that is not what
                            this Agency is about.</p>

                            <p>The study will include, at a minimum, the following topics:</p>
                            <p>—An overview of Third World hunger issues linked to U.S. strategic,
                                trade and development interests.</p>

                            <p>—A review and enumeration of recommendations from prior
                                Presidentially approved studies which were presented to the Congress

                            <p>—Major constraints to reducing or expanding U.S. food aid resources
                                should be reported in the context of a four year planning

                            <p>—An examination of the probable demands and/or tradeoffs on future
                                economic and security assistance funding resulting from higher food
                                aid levels, including appropriate levels and time frames. This
                                should also include an examination of other donor reactions to

                                should be considered, particularly those creative alternatives which
                                contribute to increasing Third World food supplies, short-term
                                liquidity, export earnings and food production. These should be

                        <p>The Department of Agriculture supports a high level study to develop a
                            creative and comprehensive U.S. food assistance program to help resolve
                            world hunger. This Department administers the P.L. 480 program which is
                            the cornerstone of U.S. foreign food assistance efforts. We recognize
                            that the effectiveness of these programs are of vital interest to the
                            United States and should be reviewed periodically.</p>
                        <p>Currently, the Department is reviewing the effectiveness of P.L. 480 and
                            other programs employed to meet world food requirements. The study
                            focuses on the long-term concern of how food and aid can best be
                            utilized to support economic and trade development. Economic development
                            is the long-term answer to alleviating hunger. The review is expected to
                            be completed by March 1.</p>
                        <p>Since this review is almost completed, the Department of Agriculture
                            recommends that this new study focus on how the United States can better
                            respond to crisis situations such as we currently face in Africa. Better
                            response is needed both in the decision making process and in
                            efficiently getting the food to the people in need.</p>
                        <p>I recommend that Daniel G. Amstutz, Under Secretary for International
                            Affairs and Commodity Programs, be placed on the steering group and
                            chaired by the Department of State.<note n="2" xml:id="d211fn2"

                        <p>I believe the terms of reference for the study should be narrowed. I
                            recommend that the study focus on the U.S. response to conditions of
                            serious food needs in the developing world, i.e., the emergency food aid
                            provided under Title II of P.L. 480, and develop options for improving
                            that response.</p>
                        <p>The draft terms of reference contemplate a comprehensive study, not only
                            of the wide range of policy tools and financial resources available to
                            the U.S. to address Third World hunger, but also of the profound and
                            complex issues related to the causes of hunger. I do not think it
                            necessary—nor would it be feasible within a period of two months—to
                            produce a study of the issues.</p>
                        <p>As you know, the U.S. response to the challenges of hunger, poverty and
                            underdevelopment was quite recently the subject of substantial scrutiny
                            by a very prominent body. The <persName corresp="#p_CAJ_1"
                                >Carlucci</persName> Commission considered how food aid, as well as
                            other foreign assistance instruments, contributed to U.S. efforts to
                            address serious problems of poverty and hunger, in the context of U.S.
                            foreign policy, national security, economic and commercial
                                interests.<note n="2" xml:id="d212fn2">See Bernard Gwertzman, “Panel

                            food aid, and the integration of PL 480 resources with other forms of
                            economic assistance to maximize development impact. While the mandate of
                            the <persName corresp="#p_CAJ_1">Carlucci</persName> Commission was of
                            course much broader, its study included careful consideration of PL 480
                            and its relationship to U.S. interests and other forms of foreign aid. I
                            question the necessity of a similar review at this time.</p>
                        <p>I believe the members of the Development Coordination Committee Food Aid
                            Subcommittee have worked rather well together in the last few years.
                            Agreements have been reached on important budgetary, policy and
                            programmatic issues.</p>
                        <pb facs="0634" n="588" xml:id="pg_588"/>
                        <p>I propose an alternative, narrower scope for the study—one which focusses
                            on the immediate needs of people who are threatened with severe
                            malnutrition and starvation by virtue of natural disasters and civil
                            strife. This is the matter which so concerns the American people. This
                            proposal is timely, given the increasing concern in Congress and
                            elsewhere about crisis conditions in Africa.<note n="3" xml:id="d212fn3"

                                A11.</note> It is limited in scope, and thus can be accomplished
                            relatively quickly. Perhaps most important, it is <hi rend="italic"
                                >directly</hi> related to the plight of hungry people, and not
                            diluted in focus by considerations of complex trade, commercial and
                            macroeconomic issues.</p>
                        <p>I feel the <gloss target="#t_NSSD_1">NSSD</gloss> should be revised to
                            establish the terms of reference for an action oriented program plan for
                            Third World Hunger Relief based on an assessment of current U.S.
                            policies and programs concerning emergency food assistance, and feasible
                            new policies and programs to improve the U.S. response.</p>
                        <p>I believe the scope of the study would include:</p>
                        <p>—an examination of the need for emergency food relief, and the methods
                            used to determine needs globally, regionally, nationally, and within
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>—a study of how the emergency food program could be strengthened.</p>
                        <p>—an analysis of the current levels of U.S. emergency food aid.</p>
                        <p>—a review of the constraints to expanding U.S. food aid to meet emergency
                            needs.</p>
                        <p>—a consideration of the appropriate roles of other developed nations and
                            international organizations in identifying and responding to emergency
                            needs.</p>
                        <p>As to the administration of such a study, I suggest that the interagency
                            body be chaired by <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>, given our
                            paramount interest in and responsibility for international emergency
                            food aid programs. Also, there is a clear interest in Congress and some
                            vocal groups that disaster assistance not be a foreign policy matter but
                            rather be treated as a humanitarian need. In short, a lead role for
                                <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> is important in the
                            Administration’s dealing with Congress and the public. This suggestion
                            is consistent with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KRB_1"
                                >Keating</persName> performing his role as Director of the study.

                        <p>The Department of Commerce will be represented on the Interagency
                            Steering Group by the Assistant Secretary for International Economic
                            Policy.</p>
                        <p>The Department of Commerce has long stressed the linkage between trade
                            development interests and agricultural policy, particularly in the Third
                            World. We have worked closely with the Department of Agriculture in
                            putting together foreign trade missions and seminars to support economic
                            and commercial relations with countries which have demonstrated a
                            willingness to strive for agricultural self sufficiency. We look forward
                            to participating in the proposed study and hope that it will lead to a
                            more coordinated, government-wide effort linking U.S. assistance to
                            in-country attempts at agricultural development and indigenous efforts
                            to relieve hunger. (S)</p>
                        <p>Also, we particularly look forward to participating in the study of (1)
                            possible U.S. action to increase food aid without fundamental conflict
                            to our international trade obligations, and (2) steps to increase public
                            and private sector cooperation toward relieving Third World debt and
                            hunger. It is in the U.S. economic/commercial interest, as well as our
                            strategic and political interest, to alleviate these problems and much
                            can be done to increase public perception of this fact.</p>

                            obvious importance, and the terms of reference appear to be well thought

                        <p>2. We believe that specific attention should be given to the probable
                            political impact both of hunger and of possible US efforts to alleviate
                            hunger in those Third World countries of greatest importance to the
                            United States. In particular, the possibility that ill-conceived US
                            efforts in this area could upset the political or social balance in
                            certain Third World countries or undermine ongoing programs of friendly
                            governments should be examined. [<hi rend="italic">portion marking not

                        <p>3. The possible effect of expanded food assistance programs on trade
                            patterns and future agricultural production in the Third World should
                            also be addressed. [<hi rend="italic">portion marking not

                            relief.</p>
                        <p>The study represents a timely opportunity to examine one of the major
                            international issues that must be faced over the next few years.
                            However, to keep food aid in perspective in analyzing the issue, we
                            recommend that the study distinguish between short-term and long-term
                            hunger issues.</p>
                        <p>• <hi rend="italic">Short-term</hi> hunger problems, for example, those
                            due to the African drought, can be addressed by emergency food aid, such
                            as the U.S. provides under Title II of PL 480.</p>
                        <p>• <hi rend="italic">Long-term</hi> hunger problems are much more
                            intractible and are largely attributable to deficiencies in agricultural
                            policies in recipient countries. Food aid is only one of many ways of
                            transferring resources to relieve the problem. Many other factors need
                            to be considered, such as ongoing efforts to improve the capacity of the
                            third world to feed itself.</p>
                        <p>We caution against a premature conclusion that the answer to the
                            underlying problem of relieving third world hunger lies in providing
                            substantial increases in food aid or agricultural export assistance
                            programs.</p>
                        <p>Finally, we recommend that the study consider ways to improve
                            implementation of food aid programs. For example:</p>
                        <quote>
                            <p>• How best can conflicting policy objectives of the program be
                                reconciled?</p>
                            <p>• Should maritime subsidies be funded under the program?</p></quote>

                            clear, the study will focus on alternative and creative means to close
                            the food “gap,” perhaps by increasing U.S. food shipments to affected
                            countries. Emphasis will be placed on reviewing food aid mechanisms
                            which will not affect the budget. The study would be completed by April
                            30, 1984.</p>

                            comments have clearly supported the need for this study. Given the short
                            timetable available for this review of hunger relief, a few agencies
                            suggested that the study focus on emergency food assistance. The
                            President’s request for such a study stems in part from the current
                            emergency situation as to food in Africa and other parts of the world.
                            It is the President’s view, though, that today’s emergency food problem
                            is indicative of the larger concern of how U.S. and other donor country
                            food aid programs treat the world hunger problem over time. Thus, while
                            this study should make recommendations on how the current emergency food
                            program might best be strengthened, these recommendations must be made
                            in the larger light of our other long-term efforts to relieve hunger in
                            the Third World. The attached <gloss target="#t_NSSD_1">NSSD</gloss>

                        <p>To produce a National Security Decision Directive (<gloss

                        <p>The study will include, at a minimum, the following topics:</p>
                        <p>—An overview of Third World hunger issues linked to U.S. strategic,
                            trade, humanitarian and development interests.</p>
                        <pb facs="0641" n="595" xml:id="pg_595"/>
                        <p>—An examination of the effectiveness of U.S. policy tools and resources
                            used to alleviate hunger.</p>
                        <p>—A review and enumeration of recommendations from prior Presidentially
                            approved studies which were presented to the Congress and enacted.</p>
                        <p>—Additional policy options for assuring effective U.S. support for
                            relieving Third World hunger problems.</p>
                        <p>—Alternatives for reducing or expanding U.S. food aid resources to
                            address the hunger problem should be evaluated in the context of a four
                            year planning framework—1984–1988.</p>
                        <p>—An examination of the probable demands and/or tradeoffs on future
                            economic and security assistance funding resulting from higher food aid
                            levels, including appropriate levels and time frames. This should also
                            include an examination of other reactions, donors, suppliers and
                            recipient countries to higher or lower food aid levels.</p>
                        <p>—Alternatives to current agricultural export assistance programs should
                            be considered, particularly those creative alternatives which contribute
                            to increasing Third World food supplies, short-term liquidity, export
                            earnings and food production. These should be examined and presented

                        <p>Three months ago, President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1"
                                >Reagan</persName> asked that we examine the problems of hunger and
                            starvation in the Third World, and the U.S. response to them.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d219fn2">See <ref target="#d217">Document 217</ref>.</note>
                            The President was particularly concerned about starvation in poor
                            countries suffering from drought or other natural disasters, although he
                            asked that we review non-emergency food problems as well. This is the
                            first time that we have looked at Third World food problems from this
                            perspective.</p>
                        <p>This memorandum reports on the first part of our work, acute food crisis
                            situations where emergency food aid can prevent starvation. We have
                            analyzed our emergency food aid processes from beginning to end,
                            reviewing the adequacy of <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                            operations and mechanisms, the extent of distribution constraints, the
                            quality of food supply and demand data, and the degree to which we have
                            received international cooperation in our relief efforts.</p>
                        <p>Our findings reveal that starvation continues to be a real threat to
                            rural populations in the poorest countries of the Third World. It is
                            especially acute in sub-Saharan Africa where millions live in absolute
                            poverty. The United States response to Third World hunger has always
                            been generous—unrivaled in the world. For example, the <persName
                                corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> Administration doubled
                            emergency food aid over fiscal years 1982 to 1984 to $343 million. This
                            year we are providing 663,000 metric tons of emergency food aid,
                            amounting to 45 percent of all donor financing. Almost 60 percent of our
                            emergency food aid is going to 24 sub-Saharan African countries hard hit
                            by a drought that this time affects not only the vast Sahelian area in
                            the north, but also the usually fertile savannah and livestock plains as
                            far as the southern African veldt.</p>
                        <p>Generally, Congressional support for regular appropriations for PL 480
                            programs (supplemental funds to meet extraordinary emergency needs) is
                            excellent. This is a reflection of our humanitarian concerns, and the
                            existence of U.S. farm surpluses and the many interests served by the PL
                            480 program. However, the time required to obtain approval of additional
                            funds to meet emergency needs is regarded as unaccept<pb facs="0643"
                                n="597" xml:id="pg_597"/>ably long in view of the human suffering
                            associated with delays in food shipments.</p>
                        <p>The most demanding task of emergency food relief programs begins at the
                            port of entry in the Third World. There the effort to distribute
                            foodstuffs inland to remote areas can be very difficult, and sometimes
                            impossible in countries where military violence either disrupts or
                            prevents access to hungry people. In combination with badly rutted or
                            non-existent roads, and beaten-up trucks, the job of food delivery is
                            indeed expensive, time-consuming, and dangerous. The field workers of
                            the private voluntary organizations and other international programs who
                            have long been in the vanguard in carrying out this responsibility are
                            to be commended for their valiant efforts.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, poor countries suffering from food shortage emergencies
                            have been increasingly unable to share the burden of the internal
                            distribution costs of free food. They were once able to meet the extra
                            expense (both local currency and foreign exchange), but their worsening
                            balance of payments positions increasingly compel them to turn to donors
                            and international organizations to pay these costs. As a consequence,
                            the financing of the complete emergency food aid delivery system, from
                            farmer to port of entry to hungry people, is likely to fall on donors if
                            more lives are to be saved.</p>
                        <p>The timely provision and accuracy of food supply and demand data are
                            other areas of concern. Various studies suggest that the margin of
                            safety for coping with sudden drops in local food production is
                            shrinking in many Third World countries, particularly in sub-Saharan
                                Africa.<note n="3" xml:id="d219fn3">Not further identified.</note>
                            They are prone to acute food crises because of irrational government
                            policies which have caused a structural deterioration of their
                            agricultural sectors and a severe decline in food production. While we
                            expect an increase in emergency food requests over the next five years,
                            we are not entirely comfortable with the analytical models now used to
                            estimate demand.</p>
                        <p>In carrying out emergency food aid programs, cooperation from other donor
                            countries and international organizations can increase the effectiveness
                            of our bilateral assistance and lead to a greater total food aid effort.
                            The United States contributes 25 percent of the resources for the FAO
                            and <gloss target="#t_WFP_1">WFP</gloss>, but with regard to the FAO we
                            are dissatisfied with its leadership and management. Moreover, FAO
                            interpretations of emergency food requirements often do not square with
                            those of major donors. Our own expectations with regard to other donor
                            governments and international food organizations have not been entirely
                                <pb facs="0644" n="598" xml:id="pg_598"/> clear; an uncertainty that
                            constrains us in seeking improvements in international emergency food
                            aid cooperation and coordination.</p>
                        <p>A final area where improvement is needed concerns cooperation between the
                            public and private sectors on Third World hunger problems. In spite of
                            the United States’ tremendous food aid efforts over the past three
                            decades, the general public is still largely unaware of what we have
                            done and are doing. The media have tended to focus, perhaps
                            disproportionately, on the severity of the hunger problem rather than on
                            the many positive actions the Administration has taken to meet the
                            challenge. In addition, the potential of the business community to
                            provide government decisionmakers with unique regional perspectives and
                            expertise for Third World hunger problems has gone mostly untapped.</p>
                        <p>Our findings suggest that if we are to reduce loss of life caused by
                            acute food crises, we must 1) respond more rapidly; 2) deliver food more
                            effectively; 3) improve food data analysis; 4) cooperate more closely
                            with the private sectors, and 5) seek improvements in international
                            cooperation and coordination. We have made ten specific recommendations
                            to reach these objectives.</p>
                        <p>We have also considered the budgetary implications of our recommendations
                                (attached),<note n="4" xml:id="d219fn4">The undated analyses of the
                                individual recommendations are numbered one through eight and are

                            only in cases where, in our judgement, additional funding (provided in a
                            timely and flexible way) could break critical bottlenecks and help
                            maintain the integrity of our emergency food aid programs. Amended
                            legislation would be necessary for three of our recommendations.</p>
                        <p>We are continuing to work on the second part of our report, the
                            non-emergency food problems, and will shortly submit recommendations to
                            the Steering Group.</p>

                            <p>PL 480 Title II authorizes the President to determine requirements
                                and provide agricultural commodities, on behalf of the people of the

                                    Development and Assistance Act of 1954, as amended (P.L. 480),
                                    Sec. 201. [Footnote is in the original.]</note> The Act further
                                states that the President may furnish the commodities through
                                friendly governments and private or public agencies, including
                                multilateral organizations. In addition, the legislation
                                specifically prohibits furnishing Title II assistance to one
                                country—Vietnam.</p>
                            <p>The United States historically has shared its bountiful food supplies
                                with victims of natural disasters (such as floods, droughts,
                                earthquakes and hurricanes) and has helped to avert starvation for
                                victims of man-made problems (such as refugees from civil
                                disturbances or armed conflict). This humanitarian food assistance
                                has been provided as emergency or refugee relief without regard to
                                the political philosophy of the government whose people receive the
                                food aid.</p>
                            <p>Like all forms of PL 480 food aid, requests for emergency or refugee
                                relief are reviewed and approved under established procedures set
                                forth by the inter-agency Development Coordination Committee.</p>
                            <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">II.</hi> A.I.D. Policy</p>
                            <p>It continues to be A.I.D. policy to provide food aid for emergency or
                                refugee relief requirements of needy persons without regard to the
                                political philosophy of their government. The guiding principle
                                underlying this policy is that a hungry child knows no politics. The
                                    <pb facs="0648" n="602" xml:id="pg_602"/> desire is to mount a
                                concerted effort quickly and decisively in response to a
                                humanitarian need.</p>
                            <p>In determining the appropriate response to a request for such food
                                aid, A.I.D. must take into consideration several factors: (a) the
                                nature of the disaster or other requirement—including the need to
                                provide food as quickly as possible; (b) the nutritional needs of
                                the population affected; (c) the amount and type of food assistance
                                provided by other international donors; (d) the logistical
                                requirements of delivering the food to those in need; (e) whether or
                                not there is reasonable assurance that the food deliveries will be
                                monitored, including, but not limited to, on-site inspection by
                                A.I.D. or an intermediary; (f) a determination that adequate storage
                                facilities are available in the recipient country to avoid commodity
                                spoilage or waste; (g) a determination that the distribution of the
                                food aid will not result in a substantial disincentive to or
                                interference with domestic production or marketing; and (h) other
                                relevant factors considered necessary to determine an appropriate
                                response.</p>
                            <p>In reviewing emergency or refugee food aid requests, A.I.D. must be
                                sensitive to the enormous complexities associated with mounting an
                                effective and timely response to urgent needs under uncertain
                                circumstances that frequently require hard choices and immediate
                                judgements. A.I.D. will review such requests to assure that the
                                assistance is not perceived as a substitute for action which a
                                responsible recipient government may need to take to assure adequate
                                food supplies for its people, and that it will not create a
                                dependency on further food aid shipments. At the same time, in
                                deciding whether or not, or to what extent, to provide such food
                                assistance, A.I.D. will endeavor not to penalize those in need of
                                assistance for the inadequate action or inappropriate policies of
                                their government.</p>
                            <p>The following additional factors will also be taken into account.</p>
                            <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Emergency Situations</hi>. A.I.D. is reluctant
                                to provide “emergency” food aid to help alleviate a chronic
                                food-deficit situation that occurs year after year in the same
                                country which in substantial measure is brought about by
                                inappropriate government policies, since this reduces the resources
                                available to respond to those emergency situations that are sudden
                                and unanticipated. In such cases, the provision of emergency food
                                aid should be linked to (but not necessarily conditioned on) a
                                policy dialogue with the recipient country with the view to
                                correcting the policies which bear significant responsibility for
                                the chronic deficit. Emergency food aid provided in this fashion can
                                help to assure adequate availability of food in the future. Should
                                efforts to start such a dialogue fail, consideration should be given
                                to providing aid through an intermediary such as a <gloss
                                    target="#t_PVO_1">PVO</gloss> or multilateral organization with
                                a proven ability to deliver food to those in actual need of
                                assistance.</p>
                            <pb facs="0649" n="603" xml:id="pg_603"/>
                            <p>In cases where the chronic food deficit is related to weather or
                                natural resource constraints (in contrast to policy constraints),
                                the provision of emergency food aid should be linked to a dialogue
                                concerning measures that might help to mitigate or ameliorate the
                                problem.</p>
                            <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Situations Involving Refugees or Displaced
                                    Persons</hi>. Under these circumstances, A.I.D. may provide food
                                aid to those in need under government-to-government programs and/or
                                non-government programs, whichever is appropriate.</p>
                            <p>Persons requiring emergency food aid may reside in a country which,
                                while their own, is controlled by a government unsympathetic to
                                their legitimate need for food aid. Provision of food aid on a
                                government-to-government basis under these circumstances should only
                                be considered where A.I.D. can be assured that the food will
                                actually be delivered to those in need. A.I.D. normally does not
                                provide emergency food aid to persons in a country if the government
                                of that country opposes such assistance. A decision to do so (for
                                example, providing food aid through a <gloss target="#t_PVO_1"

                            to meet the following objectives: to respond more rapidly in delivering
                            food to Third World countries experiencing food crises; to distribute
                            food in-country more effectively; to improve the quality of
                            food/transport/distribution information and methods of forecasting acute
                            food crises; to seek greater international cooperation to deal
                            effectively with acute hunger problems through existing public and
                            private fora; to increase public, business and foreign awareness of U.S.
                            hunger relief programs and the hunger problem in the Third World; and to
                            seek greater international cooperation in response to acute hunger
                            problems. (C)</p>

                            acute food crises, ten actions are to be taken as recommended by the

                            State Department’s Advisory Committee on International Investment,
                            Technology and Development, to permit business leaders to share
                            information on Third World hunger problems and to address these concerns
                            in a cooperative manner.</p>
                        <p>9) The <gloss target="#t_NSSD_1">NSSD</gloss> 1–84 Working Group will

                            donor governments and international organizations on the emergency food

                            consider recommending a high-level donors meeting or other similar
                            measures to improve international coordination in effectively meeting
                            food aid emergencies. Negotiations and communications with other
                            countries on these matters shall continue through existing, approved
                            methods. (C)</p>
                        <p>These ten actions are designed to improve the efficiency of the <gloss

                            needed between now and September 1985 if the approximately seven million
                            Ethiopians currently at risk are to be saved. This means that 100,000
                                <gloss target="#t_MT_1">MT</gloss> of food will have to be channeled
                            monthly through the local logistical system which is now capable of
                            handling only 50,000 <gloss target="#t_MT_1">MT</gloss> per month. If
                            this system is to be upgraded, and deliveries to drought victims
                            assured, the worldwide donor community will have to contribute more
                            generously, and in a more coordinated fashion, than is now the case. One
                            way of achieving these objectives, according to the <gloss
                                target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> Administrator, would be for the
                            Secretary General to convene a special pledging and coordination session
                            to focus the attention of all possible contributors on the magnitude of
                            the suffering unfolding now in Ethiopia—with the probability of similar

                            possibly, Niger, Mali and Mauritania. The Administrator then referred to
                            a special meeting of the DAC on the African emergency which will take

                            value of $190 million. This compares with a commitment of $172 million
                            for all of last FY—which was the highest amount of food aid programmed
                            to Africa in U.S. history.</p>

                            shielded “from the worst” by the bands of soldiers that surrounded his
                            entourage wherever it went in Ethiopia. He then confided that the
                            Ethiopian Government saw itself “very much on the spot.” Its concerns
                            over the grave food situation were not wholly humanitarian. The regime
                            remembers only too well that the previous administration was toppled in
                            the mid 1970’s largely because it failed to mount an effective
                            drought-relief campaign.<note n="6" xml:id="d226fn6">Reference is to the

                            regime also recognizes, according to the Sec Gen, that it will have to
                            turn eventually to the West for development aid since—like many African
                            governments—its flirtation with socialism has had disastrous effects on
                            the Ethiopian economy.</p>
                        <p>6. Jean Ripert pointed out that the Ethiopian Government already was
                            hoping that some of the emergency assistance it would be receiving could
                            be used for longer-term rehabilitation. During their recent trip, the
                            government had asked for <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> assistance
                            in helping to resettle Ethiopians from the highlands into the Ogaden
                            region in the South. Aware of the political implications, the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> team had declined to comment on the
                            proposal. The <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> Administrator
                            pointedly referred to the enormous pressure in the U.S. against the
                            provision of development assistance to the Mengistu regime. Indeed our
                            humanitarian response could be seriously jeopardized if any of the U.S.
                            assistance was used in connection with development projects proposed by
                            the current regime. (Both the Sec Gen and Ripert nodded in complete
                            understanding.)</p>
                        <p>7. The Sec Gen agreed that the <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>
                            Administrator’s idea on a special <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                            pledging and coordinating session was a good one—if held at the Perm Rep
                            level. He then mused about “<gloss target="#t_LDC_1">LDC</gloss>
                            Governments, being, at times, their own worst enemies.” On several
                            occasions he had felt compelled to advise them “to get their own houses
                            and priorities in order” if they expected him to mount special appeals
                            for outside assistance. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KAL_1"
                                >Keyes</persName> underscored the Secretary’s point by alluding to
                            the current General Assembly proposal to allocate $73 million for an
                            unneeded ECA Conference Center in Addis Ababa at a time when starvation
                            ran rampant in the countryside. (All agreed that the Conference Center
                            proposal was indeed unfortunate.)<note n="7" xml:id="d226fn7">In

                        <p>8. The Director General parenthetically referred to a growing concern
                            among Latin American countries that “all this attention on Africa” will
                            leave L.A. with a shrinking portion of donor assistance. The Secretary
                            General agreed about the concern and confided that it may be necessary
                            “to stage a compensatory event” for the Latin Americans in the not too
                            distant future.</p>
                        <p>9. The discussion then shifted to Kurt Jansson’s mandate as the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Special Coordinator for Emergency
                            Assistance in Addis. The Sec Gen reaffirmed that Jansson reports
                            directly to him and has complete authority to make decisions
                            on-the-ground as he deems necessary. (The <gloss target="#t_UNDP_1"
                                >UNDP</gloss> Res Rep would not be a “problem,” according to the Sec
                            Gen, because King fully understands the need to focus his energies on
                            “non-emergency assistance matters.”) In keeping with the prevailing
                            frankness, <persName corresp="#p_MMP_1">McPherson</persName> indicated
                            that the U.S. Government was concerned about the quality of some <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Representatives in the field. Given the
                            fact that the bulk of emergency assistance will flow through bilateral
                            channels, it seems only fitting that bilateral donors have a real say
                            about which <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> agency rep (e.g., <gloss
                                target="#t_UNDP_1">UNDP</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_WFP_1"
                                >WFP</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_UNICEF_1">UNICEF</gloss>) should
                            assume the role of emergency relief coordinator in a given country. In
                            the same connection, the U.S. Government favors the setting up of a
                            small “executive board of principal donors,” in each disaster country,
                            to make sure that coordination runs smoothly. <persName
                                corresp="#p_PDCJ_1">Perez de Cuellar</persName> did not directly
                            address this last point—instead, he softly lamented the fact that
                            “member governments” had eroded the Secretary General’s coordination
                            effectiveness over the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> family by
                            allowing the individual <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> agencies to
                            become too autonomous.</p>
                        <p>10. The <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> Administrator then asked the
                            Secretary General’s indulgence to sum up his understanding of what would
                            come out of the meeting. First, the Secretary General will call a
                            special emergency assistance pledging session for Ethiopia at the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> “in two weeks time.” In preparation for
                            that session Kurt Jansson will draw up a logistics plan for the Ethiopia
                            emergency situation—as well as a resource gap analysis which will be
                            distributed to all prospective donors before the pledging session.<note

                            Secondly, before the close of the Special Session on Ethiopia, the
                            Secretary General will announce that there will be a follow-on
                            African-wide emergency appeal session to be held at the <gloss

                        <p>The disaster in Africa caused by famine has generated widespread concern
                            throughout the United States and the Western World. The U.S. government
                            response to the crisis has been prompt and to date, $200 million in food
                            assistance has been provided to the people of Africa.</p>
                        <p>The United States is also providing emergency food assistance for other
                            drought-stricken African nations which are facing severe food shortages.
                            New amounts of emergency food assistance have been announced for
                            Mozambique ($5.9 million), Mauritania ($8.5 million) and Chad ($5.6
                            million).</p>

                        <p>1. S—Entire text.</p>
                        <p>2. Summary and action requested. Dept has decided to make a demarche to
                            the Soviets asking their support for greater free passage of food within
                            Ethiopia. Paragraph 7 of this message contains talking points for use by
                            Ambassador Hartman or <gloss target="#t_DCM_1">DCM</gloss> with highest
                            available Soviet Foreign Ministry official. Paragraph 8 contains points
                            to be used by Embassy Addis to inform the Ethiopians on our various
                            approaches on this subject, including informing them of the Soviet
                            demarche. End summary.</p>
                        <p>3. Background: Given increasingly dire humanitarian needs in Ethiopia and
                            to ease refugee burdens in Sudan and persistent political obstacles to
                            effective delivery of emergency assistance to affected population in
                            Ethiopia, Dept believes it is necessary to investigate fully and
                            urgently the possibility for some sort of a “safe passage” arrangement
                            agreed on by both the Central Government and insurgents.</p>
                        <p>At least three million people, perhaps a majority of those affected by
                            the current drought in Ethiopia, are behind rebel lines and have been
                            receiving only marginal assistance through Ethiopian Government feeding
                            centers and through unpublicized cross-border operations from Sudan. The
                            situation has deteriorated rapidly, with as many as 1700 people in
                            insurgent areas of Eritrea, Tigre and Welo dying each day. Mass
                            migrations are underway, perhaps of several hundred thousand, to Sudan.
                            Both sides appear to have taken actions, for political reasons, which
                            impede the delivery of food to people in need. This is an extremely
                            pressing issue. For example, there have been recent reports that
                            Ethiopian MiGs strafed people migrating from insurgent areas to Sudan.
                            It is essential to provide safe passage for people migrating to Sudan
                            and those walking to feeding centers inside Ethiopia as well as for
                            private voluntary organization (<gloss target="#t_PVO_1">PVO</gloss>)
                            convoys and flights making deliveries in contested areas. We also need
                            Ethiopian agreement not to impede additional, perhaps massive
                            cross-border deliveries into insurgent areas from Sudan. Although
                            Mengistu has said publicly he will not agree to negotiate with
                            “bandits,” and the government has <pb facs="0667" n="621"
                                xml:id="pg_621"/> up to now formally objected to our cross-border
                            feeding programs, both sides have already acceded to free passage by the
                                <gloss target="#t_ICRC_1">ICRC</gloss> and there have been some
                            indications in private from both sides that they would not impede actual
                            deliveries by other PVOs.</p>
                        <p>4. To help address this problem, we have underway a series of diplomatic
                            actions designed to call the attention of the world community to the
                            problem and to encourage the various parties in Ethiopia to enter into
                            de facto safe passage arrangements. We anticipate that implementation
                            would be left to a neutral party such as the <gloss target="#t_ICRC_1"
                                >ICRC</gloss> and/or other PVOs. Our plan of action includes an
                            initial approach to the <gloss target="#t_ICRC_1">ICRC</gloss>, the
                            Pope, and <gloss target="#t_UNSYG_1">UNSYG</gloss>, urging them to speak
                            out both privately and publicly for a program of humanitarian safe
                            passage and ultimately to involve other figures in the effort to bring
                            pressure on both the Ethiopian Government and guerrilla forces.</p>
                        <p>5. Given the Soviet Union’s political influence with Chairman Mengistu,
                            we want the Soviets to urge him to cooperate in more complete free
                            passage of food. Mengistu’s planned December 13 visit to Moscow presents
                            us a unique opportunity to urge Soviet cooperation. Dept recognizes that
                            the Soviets would normally be unlikely to press re the Ethiopian leader.
                            On the other hand, <persName corresp="#p_CKU_1">Chernenko</persName>’s
                            statement in his November 16 interview with Marvin Kalb that one area
                            for possible US-Soviet regional cooperation would be drought relief, at
                            least provides us a handle to make an approach. The Soviets may have
                            reasons (e.g. embarrassment at the dilemma of their client state and at
                            the Soviet lack of capability to provide massive help) to encourage
                            cooperation between the rebels and the government. An additional
                            incentive for the Soviets could be our willingness to cooperate in more
                            direct Soviet participation in the larger donor network headed by the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>. We are not interested in
                            offering the Soviets a joint US–<gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                            effort in relief activities which would enable Moscow to piggyback on
                            much larger Western response. But we are testing Moscow’s bona fides in
                            asking their help on this key problem where they have clear
                            influence.</p>
                        <p>6. We will inform the Ethiopians in advance of Mengistu’s trip that we
                            are contacting numerous parties, including the Soviets, to gain
                            international support for a safe passage arrangement. Informing the
                            Ethiopians of our talks with the Soviets will prevent the latter from
                            purposely distorting our approach in such a manner as to damage our
                            efforts to pursue a broader political dialogue with Ethiopia. In short,
                            we see cooperation with the Soviets in food relief as important given
                            the situation on the ground, but do not want to enable the Soviets to
                            use this to play a larger role in the Horn.</p>
                        <p>7. Following talking points for use by Ambassador Hartman or <gloss
                                target="#t_DCM_1">DCM</gloss> on an urgent basis (we would like to
                            get to the Soviets prior to Mengistu’s arrival in Moscow on the
                            13th).</p>
                        <pb facs="0668" n="622" xml:id="pg_622"/>
                        <p>—We are concerned that food relief efforts have been seriously hampered
                            by hostilities, especially in the Eritrea and Tigre insurgent areas.</p>
                        <p>—There are continuing reports that the various political elements in
                            Ethiopia, both government and anti-government, are for political reasons
                            hindering in various ways the free movement of food, and of people
                            seeking food.</p>
                        <p>—In order to avert further mass starvation, we believe it might be
                            possible to arrive at some sort of temporary modus vivendi among the
                            parties which would allow free passage of food and other humanitarian
                            relief to all areas of the country and all segments of the
                            population.</p>
                        <p>—It is not only the United States which is concerned and which sees the
                            need for some sort of safe passage arrangement. International
                            organizations, private voluntary agencies and other donor nations share
                            this view.</p>
                        <p>—The Soviet Union is in a unique position, considering its interests in
                            Ethiopia and its role in the Ethiopian relief effort to use its
                            influence with the <gloss target="#t_PMGSE_1">PMGSE</gloss> in favor of
                            such an agreement. We note that Chairman Mengistu will soon be visiting
                            the Soviet Union. In this context, we note that Chairman <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKU_1">Chernenko</persName>, in his November 16 NBC
                            interview with Marvin Kalb, suggested drought relief as a potential area
                            of U.S.-Soviet regional cooperation.</p>
                        <p>—We recognize that neither side in the conflict will likely accede to a
                            general cease-fire. We hope, therefore, that the Ethiopian Government
                            will agree to a de facto safe passage arrangement, whereby food
                            deliveries and people in search of food are not hindered and that food
                            can be delivered in the most direct and efficient manner including from
                            Sudan. We would expect that deliveries would be conducted by apolitical
                            private voluntary organizations to be agreed to by all parties.</p>
                        <p>—The United States interest in safe passage is humanitarian. Our only
                            role in this matter is support for this concept, which has been espoused
                            by several international leaders and the media.</p>
                        <p>—The <gloss target="#t_PMGSE_1">PMGSE</gloss> is aware of our concerns
                            and the need to facilitate food distribution, and we are in touch with
                            other interested parties.</p>
                        <p>—The United States encourages the Soviet Union, in addition to continuing
                            its deliveries of food within Ethiopia, to participate more directly
                            with the donor community in Ethiopia and with the efforts of United
                            Nations Secretary General Special Representative in Ethiopia Kurt
                            Jannson.</p>
                        <p>8. For Addis: Charge should use following points with <gloss

                                >RRC</gloss> Commissioner <persName corresp="#p_DWG_1"
                                >Dawit</persName> prior to Mengistu’s departure for Moscow:</p>
                        <p>—The United States notes the considerable mention being made by the media
                            and international leaders such as Willy Brandt of the <pb facs="0669"
                                n="623" xml:id="pg_623"/> need for a “safe passage” arrangement for
                            food deliveries and for people looking for food.</p>
                        <p>—We feel that some sort of arrangement needs to be made by the Ethiopian
                            parties to facilitate the dispersing of food to all areas and to permit
                            safe passage as well to people in search of food.</p>
                        <p>[The United States?] recognizes and supports the territorial integrity of
                            Ethiopia. We have no desire to interfere with Ethiopia’s internal
                            affairs.</p>
                        <p>—We are aware of Chairman Mengistu’s desire not to enter into
                            negotiations with insurgents. This does not preclude, however, an
                            informal or de facto arrangement whereby each side agrees not to impede
                            the flow of drought victims in search of food or food deliveries. We
                            recall Commissioner <persName corresp="#p_DWG_1">Dawit</persName>’s
                            agreement in the November 2 government-to-government agreement to
                            additional efforts to make food available to all parts of Ethiopia.<note
                                n="2" xml:id="d230fn2">Not further identified.</note></p>
                        <p>—The United States, for its part, maintains its policy of delinking food
                            from politics. Our interest has been and remains assisting Ethiopians in
                            need. We and other donors are concerned that large numbers of Ethiopians
                            in northern area of fighting are not being reached. This problem is of
                            such major concern that it is rapidly becoming the number one problem in
                            Ethiopia and in the concern of the media.</p>
                        <p>—We applaud the Government of Ethiopia’s efforts to assist the drought
                            and famine situation, coordinating with donors, and improving logistics.
                            In that same spirit, we would appreciate any ideas or suggestions by the
                                <gloss target="#t_PMGSE_1">PMGSE</gloss> as to how a safe passage
                            arrangement can be obtained to get food to insurgent as well as
                            government-controlled areas. We need to consider de facto agreements to
                            safe passage of food, free movement of people seeking food, and
                            agreement on new routes for delivering food.</p>
                        <p>—This problem needs to be addressed urgently in light of the increasingly
                            desperate situation in unreachable parts of northern Ethiopia, recent
                            reports of innocent drought victims being caught in the crossfire, and
                            charges that political considerations are involved by various parties to
                            the fighting in food delivery or non-delivery.</p>
                        <p>—In view of the role the Soviets are playing in the relief effort, we are
                            also raising this with them as well as with the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss>, other donors, and humanitarian leaders and
                            organizations.</p>
                        <p>9. For Geneva: You should draw on paras 3 and 4 to alert <gloss

                        <p>2. Saw Acting Foreign Minister Tibebu Bekele afternoon December 13 and
                            conveyed points para eight reftel, stressing non-political, humanitarian
                            nature of our concern. I asked that Tibebu pass these points to Chairman
                            Mengistu and Foreign Minister Goshu during their current travels.
                            (Ethiopian radio has announced that Mengistu is on his way to Cuba. We
                            understand he will proceed to Moscow after Havana.)</p>
                        <p>3. Tibebu said he wanted to give a “preliminary reaction” to our points.
                            After expressions of appreciation for <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> Food Assistance and for <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> assurances that its assistance is humanitarian and
                            non-political, Tibebu said in fact the request <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> is making of Ethiopian Government is political. <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> is asking the Ethiopian Government to
                            make arrange<pb facs="0671" n="625" xml:id="pg_625"/>ments with
                            “criminals” and “bandits.” Tibebu said “any request for a so-called
                            third party understanding or alternative routing for delivery of food is
                            a political request to which the Ethiopian Government will have to give
                            a political response.” Tibebu added that Ethiopian Government will
                            regard <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>’s raising this matter as an
                            “unfriendly” action. Tibebu said <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> is
                            operating on basis of a misconception of situation in the north of
                            Ethiopia. If food is not getting to all parts of Ethiopia, the fault is
                            not that of the Government of Ethiopia but of criminal elements who
                            impede the free flow of food. <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                            should not ask the Government of Ethiopia to come to terms with these
                            criminal elements but should tell them to cease their criminal
                            activities. The Ethiopian Government desires to see food moved to all
                            places in Ethiopia. The only solution to the problem, Tibebu said, is
                            for the Ethiopian Government to put on more security to assure movement
                            of food, not for Ethiopian Government to be asked to reach agreements
                            with criminal elements. Tibebu continued in this vein for some time
                            before in peroration declaring that it is “inconceivable” that the
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> would want the Ethiopian
                            Government to reach an understanding with criminals that would allow
                            them to pursue their actions.</p>
                        <p>4. I said I regretted that both our presentation and our purpose had been
                            so seriously misconstrued. We did not ask the Ethiopian Government to
                            reach agreements with opposition elements, and we have no political
                            purpose in mind. We are only trying to find a practical solution to the
                            problem of getting food to people in the northern regions of the country
                            where governments and world public opinion know that thousands are
                            starving. We are seeking to consult with the Ethiopian Government to
                            find a way to get food to Ethiopian citizens in dire need.</p>
                        <p>5. Tibebu’s response to this was that “We won’t modify how we operate in
                            this country, criminals will be dealt with as criminals.” Tibebu added
                            that if the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> finds it cannot
                            continue to assist the Ethiopian Government because of “these
                            constraints”, then the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> will have to
                            “decide what to do.”</p>
                        <p>6. Comment: Tibebu would not have ventured the above response had he not
                            been quite sure it would meet with Mengistu’s approval. My guess is that
                            in this instance, unlike earlier ones, he will convey to Mengistu in
                            Havana or Moscow our approach, together with a detailed and eloquent
                            rendering of his reply.</p>

                            opportunity to urge that the Soviet Union and Ethiopia expedite relief
                            efforts. <gloss target="#t_DCM_1">DCM</gloss> underscored that the US
                            had no intention of interfering in Ethiopia’s internal affairs and we
                            fully realized the complexities of the current situation on the ground.
                            Nevertheless, there had been reports that persons in need of emergency
                            assistance had been hindered by both the government and its opponents in
                            their efforts to obtain food and other assistance.<note n="5"
                                xml:id="d232fn5">See <ref target="#d229">Document 229</ref>.</note>
                            This was reportedly taking a devastating toll of lives in Ethiopia, and
                            we wished to urge again that all sides redouble their efforts to
                            expedite relief.</p>
                        <p>4. Sinitsyn replied that the situation on the ground in Ethiopia was
                            indeed complex and that, as the US side knew, the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> was extending emergency assistance
                            to the Ethiopian Government “to the extent of its capabilities”.
                            Sinitsyn added, however, that relief assistance must be provided on a
                            humanitarian basis and not with the objective of interfering in
                            Ethiopia’s internal affairs. It was the Soviet view that all relief
                            assistance issues should be decided by the Ethiopian Government as this
                            was the only practice consistent with Ethiopian sovereignty. <pb
                                facs="0673" n="627" xml:id="pg_627"/> Sinitsyn asserted that this
                            was the “principled position” of the Soviet Government.</p>
                        <p>5. Sinitsyn added that “certain circles” had used the situation in
                            Ethiopia to achieve political objectives. This had complicated efforts
                            by the Ethiopian Government to stabilize the situation. As regards
                            further relief efforts, Sinitsyn noted that the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss> Secretary General would soon convene a conference in New
                            York on African relief problems, including the crisis in Ethiopia.<note

                        <p>6. In response to Sinitsyn, <gloss target="#t_DCM_1">DCM</gloss>
                            reiterated that we had no wish to interfere in Ethiopia’s internal
                            affairs: our interest was a humanitarian one. We sought to solve
                            practical problems associated with delivery of relief supplies. We were
                            in constant consultation with the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> and
                            other relief agencies and would be approaching the Ethiopian Government
                            to express our concerns about food deliveries by <gloss
                                target="#t_PVO_1">PVO</gloss>’s and difficulties encountered by
                            refugees moving about the country in search of assistance.</p>
                        <p>7. Sinitsyn claimed that it was unlikely the Ethiopian Government would
                            impede its own citizens’ efforts to obtain relief. According to
                            Sinitsyn, there had, however, been reports of harassment of refugees by
                            anti-government elements.<note n="7" xml:id="d232fn7">In telegram 356260
                                to Addis Ababa and Khartoum, December 4, the Department reported on
                                harassment of cross-border refugees. (Department of State, Central
                                Foreign Policy File, D840772–0464)</note>
                            <gloss target="#t_DCM_1">DCM</gloss> mentioned reports that government
                            aircraft had attacked refugees who tried to cross from Ethiopia into
                            Sudan. At this point, Tokin interjected that these reports seemed
                            questionable, since the Ethiopia/Sudan border was far from the areas of
                            central Ethiopia hardest hit by the drought. He added that it was very
                            difficult to differentiate anti-government guerrillas from refugees in
                            the area.</p>
                        <p>8. <gloss target="#t_DCM_1">DCM</gloss> said that we were well aware of
                            the “principled” Soviet position on the situation in Ethiopia. But
                            wanted nonetheless to underscore our concerns on the eve of the Mengistu
                            visit. Sinitsyn asked whether we had already been in contact with the
                            Ethiopian Government, and <gloss target="#t_DCM_1">DCM</gloss> replied
                            that our Mission in Addis Ababa was instructed to make an approach.
                            Sinitsyn closed the meeting by saying that he would convey the substance
                            of our approach to the appropriate levels of the Soviet Government.</p>

                            Africa is immense—14 to 20 million people will be at risk during the
                            next year. Food commitments by the donor nations fall short of meeting
                            this crisis and the Soviet Union will not offer any significant aid even
                            to its client states. The SNIE notes that “key to significant
                            improvements in food production is a profound change in indigenous

                            to tackle the underlying structural problems of agricultural stagnation

                        <p>The study of non-emergency food aid has focused on how U.S. food aid
                            could be used as an incentive for Third World countries to increase
                            their food production through agricultural reform, noting that an
                            adequate agricultural sector is a prerequisite for development in Third
                            World countries. This study has considered the economic and political
                            conditions in many Third World countries experiencing chronic food
                            shortages. (U)</p>
                        <p>Socialist economic systems, prevalent in underdeveloped countries, have
                            failed to achieve economic growth. As a result of this, and insufficient
                            aid by the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, an increasing number
                            of Third World countries once dominated by the socialist model are

                        <p>There are currently two major programs designed to support economic and

                        <p>American resources will support the implementation of policy changes over
                            a medium-term transition period in Third World countries—initially those
                            in Sub-Saharan Africa. This judicious use of aid—on a multi-year
                            basis—will reduce the political risks to leaders of Third World
                            countries committed to undertaking agricultural reform during a
                            transition period of economic hardship. This initiative will be designed

                        <p>The “Food for Progress” initiative’s initial duration will be 4 years.
                            The program’s composition will be up to 500,000 metric tons of grain per
                            year to be dispersed to six to eight Sub-Saharan African countries in
                            the first year of the program. Country selection criteria will be based,
                            in part, on the decision analysis methodology developed by the <gloss
                                target="#t_NSSD_1">NSSD</gloss> 1–84 study group. This methodology
                            will also be used to help determine those policy changes within a
                            country to which “Food for Progress” will be targeted as an instrument
                            for change. (C)</p>
                        <p>In contrast with other existing aid programs with comprehensive and

                            achievement of agricultural policy reform in Third World countries.

                            questioning our generosity with food, attacking “constructive

                            for food aid. Consequently, our PR efforts risk getting out in front of
                            our performance. For example, the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>

                        <p>“Food for Progress” envisages the donation of up to 500,000 tons of

                            annually over a period of four years to provide selected Third World

                            approach to encouraging policy reform in food deficit countries which
                            will:</p>
                        <p>—provide additional US resources for reducing the political risks of near
                            term food shortages resulting from agricultural policy reform;</p>
                        <p>—permit multi-year programming, free of commodity interest group
                            pressures and competing objectives inherent in the PL–480 allocation
                            process; and</p>
                        <p>—demonstrate to the Congress and the public the Administration’s
                            willingness to match US owned food surpluses with Third World food
                            needs.</p>
                        <p>Implementing Food for Progress using government-owned stocks would also
                            avoid the “use or lose” budgetary constraint which has reduced the
                            agricultural development impact of our other food aid programs. Most
                            important, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KRB_1">Keating</persName>’s
                            concept would co-exist with present PL–480 efforts and not dilute
                            limited Title I resources.</p>

                            mainly because it is more comfortable with current aid program
                            methodologies and levels. <gloss target="#t_OMB_1">OMB</gloss> proposes
                            funding “Food for Progress” from PL–480 resources. USDA has, thus far,
                            reserved its opinion on funding methodologies.</p>
                        <p>We have argued that should “Food for Progress” be reduced to a PL–480
                            “re-allocation” exercise, it would no longer be viewed as a unique
                            initiative with significant promise of achieving <gloss
                                target="#t_LDC_1">LDC</gloss> agricultural policy reform. Because of
                            the administrative barnacles built into PL–480 by law and agency
                            practices, “Food for Progress” would lose many of its distinctive
                            features, including operational efficiency and flexibility.</p>
                        <p>We conclude that “Food for Progress”, if permitted to access <gloss
                                target="#t_CCC_1">CCC</gloss> held stocks, could begin to address
                            one of the underlying causes of periodic food emergencies in Africa and
                            advance our interests in that area. Given <gloss target="#t_OMB_1"
                                >OMB</gloss>’s current position that this new program must be funded
                            from existing constrained foreign assistance resources, we may seek your
                            intervention when this difference of opinion is raised to the Budget
                            Review Board or the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> for final
                            adjudication. We believe “Food for Progress” will not prove to be an

                            it. While most of what follows has been reported in septels over the

                                target="#t_MT_1">MT</gloss> in January. The current estimate is for
                            a total of 440,000 <gloss target="#t_MT_1">MT</gloss> in the first three
                            months of calendar 1985. This compares to 220,000 <gloss

                            of the three available ports (Assab, Massawa, and Djibouti). Their
                            maximum offtake is estimated to be 135,000 <gloss target="#t_MT_1"
                                >MT</gloss> per month. The donor community (ably led by Jansson and
                            his growing staff) is seized with the problem of unloading the ships and
                            moving the food out of the ports. Various extra bagging equipment is
                            being brought in, and by mid-March, Dutch-financed port improvements
                            will have increased Assab’s capacity. Unfortunately, the priority given
                            by the <gloss target="#t_PMGSE_1">PMGSE</gloss> over the past week to
                            the unloading of two Soviet ships bringing in arms has been a serious
                            setback as far as the unloading of foodstuffs is concerned. We don’t
                            have final figures on the total amount of food and other relief goods
                            unloaded in January. But it will certainly be less than we had
                            hoped.</p>
                        <p>7. Of even more immediate concern than congestion in the ports, is the
                            problem of finding enough trucks to move the food inland. An estimated
                            3955 heavy and medium trucks are needed to handle the expected inland
                            transportation load over the near term. The government has 4005 trucks
                            in its (civilian) inventory, but as many as 40 percent are normally down
                            for repair and maintenance. New trucks are being provided in substantial
                            numbers by various donors, particularly the West Germans and Italians.
                            Many <gloss target="#t_PVO_1">PVO</gloss>’s (e.g. CRS) are also bringing
                            in new trucks. Jansson has discussed the truck situation with the number
                            three man in the government—Fisseha Desta—who quote guarantees unquote
                            that the government will provide enough vehicles to move the food
                            inland, including trucks from the military. We shall see.</p>
                        <p>8. Also of grave concern to us all is the final step in the
                            transportation/distribution process, i.e. actually getting the incoming
                            food to those who need it in all parts of the country. This problem has
                            two particularly difficult aspects:</p>
                        <p>A) Getting food to those people in government-controlled areas who are
                            too far away from—or two weak to travel to—the hundreds of established
                            feeding sites; and</p>
                        <p>B) Getting food into those northern areas not under government control.
                            Various cross-border operations from Sudan are, of course, by no means
                            sufficient to deal with the millions of drought-affected people in
                            Eritrea and Tigray. The <gloss target="#t_ICRC_1">ICRC</gloss> estimates
                            that no more than 500,000 can be helped in this way.</p>
                        <p>9. Re the problem of people who can’t make it to the feeding centers:
                            Jansson is very pleased with his first experimental air drop <pb
                                facs="0687" n="641" xml:id="pg_641"/> (January 27), involving <gloss
                                target="#t_RAF_1">RAF</gloss> and West German planes, and Ethiopian
                            Air Force helicopters. He hopes to soon organize regular air drops (only
                            in government-controlled areas, however) involving <gloss
                                target="#t_RAF_1">RAF</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_FRG_1"
                                >FRG</gloss> planes, and Polish repeat Polish helicopters, which are
                            just arriving.</p>
                        <p>10. Re the second problem: You are, I believe, fully aware of: A) All the
                            obstacles which the <gloss target="#t_PMGSE_1">PMGSE</gloss> is throwing
                            in the way of our efforts to get food to the north; B) The lack of other
                            donor support for a strong and united front against the <gloss
                                target="#t_PMGSE_1">PMGSE</gloss> on this issue; and C) Jansson’s
                            recent failure to obtain approval for unarmed <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_ICRC_1">ICRC</gloss> food convoys
                            into the north. It appears woefully clear that the only viable option at
                            the present time is increased cross-border aid from Sudan.</p>
                        <p>11. To add to the overall misery, there appears to be a [text missing
                            from bottom of page] fully defined. Recent outbreaks of cholera and
                            measles in several parts of the country, and greater evidence of
                            malnutrition among the affected famine groups, are matters of very
                            serious concern. Thus far the government has refused to acknowledge the
                            existence of cholera but many <gloss target="#t_NGO_1">NGO</gloss>’s in
                            the field are convinced of its presence.</p>
                        <p>12. The government’s resettlement policy—which it seems determined to
                            implement, whatever the cost—is an issue which divides the donor
                            community. The Embassy and <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> continue
                            strongly to believe that the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> policy
                            of not assisting the Ethiopian Government’s hastily organized, and
                            politically motivated, resettlement program is correct. But other
                            donors, particularly some Europeans and the Australians, are inclined to
                            support resettlement, as quote the only long-term answer unquote.</p>
                        <p>13. In this connection we noted the stress placed on the search for
                            long-term solutions at the recent SFRC hearings on Africa. The <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>, of course, is constrained from any
                            long-term development activities in Ethiopia by the Hickenlooper

                            have sought discreetly to disabuse those who have voiced such high

                        <p>14. Even sans Hickenlooper, and even if the <gloss target="#t_USG_1"

                            that the <gloss target="#t_PMGSE_1">PMGSE</gloss> would want to
                            establish a long-term aid relationship with the <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> at this point. Some elements in the <gloss
                                target="#t_PMGSE_1">PMGSE</gloss> would like to settle claims, but
                            Mengistu has been reluctant to move, possibly because he doesn’t want to
                            face the issue of possible long-term aid from the U.S. Moreover, as you
                            correctly pointed out in the SFRC hearings, we consider the <gloss
                                target="#t_PMGSE_1">PMGSE</gloss>’s current economic policies
                            (particularly in the agriculture sector) to be completely contrary to
                            the kind of long-term development strategy which we would espouse.</p>
                        <p>15. In sum, the overall situation here appears more positive than it was
                            just two months ago, particularly in terms of food commitments and
                            arrivals. But, given the food distribution problems—and the apparently
                            growing health problems—none of us here is very upbeat. Moreover, we are
                            being frustrated at almost every turn by the very government whose
                            people we are trying to help. Not only is the <gloss target="#t_PMGSE_1"
                                >PMGSE</gloss> opposed to food shipments to the north, but it is
                            consistently constraining us in various little ways from providing
                            relief in the government-controlled areas as well. And then the <gloss
                                target="#t_PMGSE_1">PMGSE</gloss> rubs it in by refusing to give
                            public credit for the U.S. aid which it receives.</p>
                        <p>16. For example, for 10 days the <gloss target="#t_PMGSE_1">PMGSE</gloss>
                            withheld permission for two of our <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>

                            even though their purpose is to deal with the logistics problems
                            associated with the arrival this month of the first 40,000 <gloss

                            I myself am having serious problems in securing permission to travel

                            do about them, short of threatening to withhold our aid. And that’s a
                            step we are strongly opposed to taking at the present time.</p>

                            from a misunderstanding of how the Commodity Credit Corporation

                            people, perhaps a majority of those affected by the current Ethiopian
                            drought, are behind rebel lines and are receiving only marginal
                            assistance through Ethiopian government feeding centers and through
                            unpublicized cross border feeding operations from Sudan. The situation
                            has deteriorated, with as many as 1700 people in insurgent areas dying
                            per day, and mass migrations taking place to Sudan.</p>

                            assistance. From <persName corresp="#p_KDA_1">Korn</persName>:</p>
                        <p>—The West is encouraged to feed Ethiopia’s starving millions but the
                            GOE’s allegiance is to the Soviet Bloc; massive western assistance is
                            not going to change this attitude;</p>
                        <p>—Policy is set by Mengistu, and policy reinforces ideology to cement
                            Mengistu’s ties to the Soviets; there is no sign that his ties to the
                            East are any less close, or that he has any genuine intentions to
                            improve relations with the West;</p>
                        <p>—Mengistu sees U.S. concern for feeding of starving people in Tigray and
                            Eritrea as a pretext for helping the rebels.</p>
                        <p>From intelligence reporting:</p>
                        <p>—The West is trying to use the famine as a cover to sabotage and
                            frustrate the revolution;</p>
                        <p>—Their Leninist system is in no way negotiable for economic or financial
                            aid.</p>
                        <p>These two reports should put to rest, but probably won’t, hope by some
                            that our assistance would somehow change the attitude of Mengistu and
                            other leaders and bring them to be more “realistic” in view of the
                            shortcomings of the Soviet Bloc and the basic good will of the West
                            concerning famine assistance. Mengistu is a totally committed Marxist
                            who will respond only to force and “realpolitik,” not good works or
                            moral considerations.</p>

                        <p>In becoming the largest relief donor and perhaps the most active in
                            pushing for food distribution in insecure areas, the U.S. has entered
                            into a most extraordinary involvement with Ethiopia, one that, if well
                            managed, could produce far-reaching political consequences. However,
                            there should be no expectation of dramatic “conversions” of Ethiopia’s
                            Marxist leadership. Rather we will need to maximize the opportunities
                            presented by the present situation for reducing Mengistu’s support among
                            the military and the population at large. Your approval is requested for
                            several actions along this line.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Background</p>
                        <p>U.S. relations with Ethiopia have deteriorated steadily since 1974 when a
                            Marxist-oriented military overthrew the Emperor. The situation became
                            more worrisome in 1981 when Ethiopia signed the Tripartite Pact with
                            Libya and North Yemen and began supporting and training insurgents
                            against both Sudan and Somalia. While animosities within the region are
                            deep and complex, with long historical roots, these actions of the
                            Mengistu regime, backed by <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and
                            Libyan arms, pose threats to U.S. interests in the region and the
                            stability of two of our friends. Efforts to open a serious dialogue with
                            the Mengistu leadership have produced reluctant statements of agreement
                            in principle, but there has been no concrete action. Mengistu is
                            dependent upon Soviet support for his survival and his policies.</p>
                        <p>The recent drought and famine in Ethiopia have meanwhile changed our
                            involvement there dramatically. Our emergency aid began to increase
                            sharply during 1983–84 as reports of massive starvation came to us. At
                            first, given the difficulty of working with the <gloss
                                target="#t_PMGSE_1">PMGSE</gloss>, and its own refusal to
                            acknowledge the problem to its own population, we channeled our aid
                            through private voluntary organizations. By the fall of 1984, however,
                            the problem was overwhelming the PVOs, and <pb facs="0694" n="648"
                                xml:id="pg_648"/> the <gloss target="#t_PMGSE_1">PMGSE</gloss> was
                            ready to acknowledge what the world was rapidly finding out—that tens of
                            thousands of people were dying and millions were in danger of death. In
                            September 1984, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WVA_1"
                                >Walters</persName> and I met in New York with the Ethiopian Foreign
                            Minister and made two discrete offers:<note n="2" xml:id="d243fn2">In
                                telegram 4576 from Addis Ababa, October 8, 1984, the Embassy

                                State, Central Foreign Policy File, D840639–0679)</note> (1) We
                            renewed and defined in detail our readiness for a thorough and
                            far-reaching political dialogue; (2) we offered, without condition
                            regarding political differences or a dialogue, a massive relief effort
                            including government-to-government assistance. The <gloss
                                target="#t_PMGSE_1">PMGSE</gloss> accepted both offers in principle,
                            but has only proceeded with the second. In November, their Relief
                            Commissioner came to Washington to negotiate and sign an emergency
                            program, including 50,000 <gloss target="#t_MT_1">MT</gloss> of food on
                            a government-to-government basis. Days later, American planes were
                            flying food, an <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> team was set up
                            in-country and <gloss target="#t_PVO_1">PVO</gloss> programs further
                            expanded. In FY85, our emergency aid to Ethiopia will be close to $330
                            million.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Political Consequences</p>
                        <p>Several things have happened on the political plane as a result of our
                            action:</p>
                        <p>—Our massive, lead involvement in the relief effort is widely known at
                            all levels in Ethiopia, in spite of the refusal of the Ethiopian
                            Government to publicize it. Our Embassy personnel, as well as other
                            seasoned Ethiopia watchers, report warm, effusive expressions of
                            appreciation from government officials and ordinary people alike, in
                            Addis Ababa and in the countryside. Embassy working relations with the
                                <gloss target="#t_PMGSE_1">PMGSE</gloss> have eased considerably,
                            and there has been no objection to introduction of <gloss
                                target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> staff, monitors, etc. There has been a
                            virtual cessation of attacks on the U.S. in the government-controlled
                            press.</p>
                        <p>—The <hi rend="italic">top</hi> levels of the <gloss target="#t_PMGSE_1"
                                >PMGSE</gloss>, however, have become defensive and at times
                            antagonistic toward our role, making no political concessions at all.
                            They cannot admit what everyone in Ethiopia knows, that the West—not the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>—is saving Ethiopia at the
                            time of disaster. The true magnitude of our aid is thus never publicized
                            in the Ethiopian media. Moreover, they fear, rightly, that as the relief
                            effort goes on, more people at home and abroad are questioning whether
                            the <gloss target="#t_PMGSE_1">PMGSE</gloss>’s policies are not in fact
                            partly to blame for the disaster: internal agricultural policies that
                            emphasized state farms and collectivization and a foreign policy
                            dependence on the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> that brought
                            military but no economic aid. There is also the memory that failure to
                            address quickly the drought of 1973/74 was the galvanizing cause behind
                            the fall of <pb facs="0695" n="649" xml:id="pg_649"/> the Emperor. Thus
                            the <gloss target="#t_PMGSE_1">PMGSE</gloss> takes pains to blame the
                            donors, not the <gloss target="#t_PMGSE_1">PMGSE</gloss>, for responding
                            too late.</p>
                        <p>—The drought has meanwhile produced new issues between us. One is the
                                <gloss target="#t_PMGSE_1">PMGSE</gloss>’s proposal to relocate 1.5
                            million people from the drought-wracked north to other parts of the
                            country. We have refused to participate in the scheme charging that it
                            is poorly prepared, partly coercive and politically motivated (i.e., to
                            deprive rebel forces of their popular base). The <gloss
                                target="#t_PMGSE_1">PMGSE</gloss> has reacted sharply and trumpeted
                            Soviet support for it.</p>
                        <p>—A more serious political issue arising out of the drought is in the
                            north. Approximately 2.3 million of the 7 million persons at risk in
                            Ethiopia are in areas contested by rebels and thus outside <gloss
                                target="#t_PMGSE_1">PMGSE</gloss> control. Both the <gloss

                            people. As a result tens of thousands are fleeing to Sudan, creating an
                            emergency there, and many more may just die. The U.S., like other
                            donors, has responded by sending some food, through PVOs and the <gloss

                            the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>, the <gloss target="#t_PMGSE_1"
                                >PMGSE</gloss>, and the other donors to do more about it.</p>
                        <p>—The “northern problem” blurs the distinction between emergency aid and
                            our political agenda with the <gloss target="#t_PMGSE_1">PMGSE</gloss>.
                            The <gloss target="#t_PMGSE_1">PMGSE</gloss>’s rabid reaction to aid
                            across the Sudan border relates to its preoccupation with the Eritrean
                            and Tigrean insurgencies for which it has sought and received massive
                            Soviet arms but been unable to quell. The <gloss target="#t_PMGSE_1"
                                >PMGSE</gloss> is convinced that if only “enemy countries”—Sudan,
                            Iraq, Saudi Arabia, but these seen as encouraged by the U.S.—would stop
                            supporting the rebels, the insurgencies could be crushed. This is the
                                <gloss target="#t_PMGSE_1">PMGSE</gloss>’s stated justification for
                            backing southern Sudan rebels against <persName corresp="#p_NJM_1"
                                >Nimeiri</persName>. Moderates within the <gloss target="#t_PMGSE_1"
                                >PMGSE</gloss> will also cite this problem, along with Somali
                            irrendentism, as the basis for Ethiopia’s closeness to the Soviets,
                            i.e., a need for arms.</p>
                        <p>—Thus the northern famine issue goes beyond humanitarian concerns to
                            fundamental political issues of the Horn. Nevertheless, the <gloss
                                target="#t_PMGSE_1">PMGSE</gloss> continues to stall on a political
                            dialogue with us in which such issues could be discussed.</p>
                        <pb facs="0696" n="650" xml:id="pg_650"/>
                        <p>In summary, the <gloss target="#t_PMGSE_1">PMGSE</gloss> is trying to
                            ride the tiger of the famine, including the sudden and dramatic
                            dependence on the West for help, without having to change political
                            direction or admit its failures.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">U.S. Policy and Opportunities</p>
                        <p>We should not expect any major change in the political outlook of
                            Mengistu and his top cohorts. They are deeply committed to their present
                            ideological and foreign policy positions, and deeply suspicious of the
                            U.S. Our involvement in aiding Ethiopia will not therefore, unlike our
                            early food aid to Mozambique, help bring about revisions in Mengistu’s
                            views.</p>
                        <p>The regime, however, is not shaky. Mengistu is too clever and too brutal
                            to be easily overthrown. Soviet and Cuban presence also protects him. If
                            change is to come, short of chance assassination, it will have to come
                            about from major disaffection among the military and perhaps the
                            internal security establishment, forcing either a change in leadership
                            or a change in Mengistu’s positions.</p>
                        <p>This will happen, we believe, only when these groups, risking Soviet and
                            Cuban reaction, become convinced, (a) that Mengistu risks not only major
                            famine but dismemberment of the country, and (b) that the West can offer
                            not only economic help but some help or at least assurances on
                            preserving national unity. It is the fear of chaos leading to
                            dismemberment (as well as fear of retribution) that keeps the military
                            elite loyal to Mengistu; without Eritrea, Ethiopia becomes a landlocked
                            country and perhaps unravels altogether. Mengistu has played on this
                            fear, using it along with ideology to justify the Soviet role, and it
                            has been the rationale for elimination of each of his rivals since
                            1975.</p>

                        <p>We are however, favorably positioned by the drought and our extraordinary
                            involvement in aid to intensify public pressure on the <gloss
                                target="#t_PMGSE_1">PMGSE</gloss>, increase disaffection, and
                            discredit the <gloss target="#t_PMGSE_1">PMGSE</gloss>’s policies. To do
                            so, we must preserve a steady course, and not give in to pressures for
                            sudden and ill-conceived reactions. For example, we are being pressed by
                            some elements in Congress to negotiate rapidly solutions to Hickenlooper
                            and Brooke Amendment problems<note n="5" xml:id="d243fn5">The Brooke
                                amendment placed restrictions on aid to nations behind in debt

                            which prohibit regular development assistance so that we can move beyond
                            emergency aid to longer term assistance. This would give up one of the
                            most important “plums” in our political dialogue. On the other side,
                            some advocate punishing Ethiopia by a reduction in our emergency
                            aid—this would only subject us to massive criticism at home and abroad,
                                <pb facs="0697" n="651" xml:id="pg_651"/> with renewed media
                            pictures of starving babies, etc., and deprive us of the unique position
                            we have gained for spotlighting the <gloss target="#t_PMGSE_1"
                                >PMGSE</gloss>’s gross policy failures.</p>
                        <p>There are also some who would advocate our lending support to the rebel
                            groups, but this would only strengthen Mengistu’s hand internally with
                            his military which is the one group that can bring about political
                            change. Furthermore, any aid we could give to separatists’
                            organizations, for political or military purposes, would be marginal.
                            They receive arms from Ethiopian defeats, refuge from Sudan and aid from
                            Arab states—all sufficient to bleed the <gloss target="#t_PMGSE_1"
                                >PMGSE</gloss>. Military victory, however, is beyond their
                            grasp.</p>
                        <p>The elements of a steadier course are:</p>
                        <p>1. Maintain the high ground we now have with our food and other emergency
                            programs. Our involvement in the drought emergency has provided us a
                            unique credibility with other donors, African states and the more
                            pro-Ethiopian elements in Congress in criticizing <gloss
                                target="#t_PMGSE_1">PMGSE</gloss> shortcomings.</p>
                        <p>2. Intensify popular and elites’ knowledge in Ethiopia of the U.S. role
                            in the current emergency and contrast it to the <gloss
                                target="#t_PMGSE_1">PMGSE</gloss>’s limited acknowledgement of it.
                            One way will be to maximize visible U.S. assistance, e.g., we have
                            offered the use of U.S. military medics for giving vaccinations and
                            supplying emergency care to drought victims. Another would be a more
                            concerted effort by <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>, USIS, private
                            Americans and direct Embassy contacts to make known the importance and
                            magnitude of the U.S. response. Third would be to be sure to provide
                            U.S. emergency aid to the several regions of Ethiopia affected by
                            drought.</p>
                        <p>3. Broaden knowledge among <gloss target="#t_PMGSE_1">PMGSE</gloss>
                            elites, especially in the military, of our offer of dialogue, including
                            issues relevant to Ethiopian unity. Make clear to important Ethiopians
                            that the U.S. is prepared to develop more normal relations, including an
                            aid relationship, with an Ethiopian government that is prepared to
                            reconsider positons inimical to U.S. interests. Do not become a
                            demandeur, but use occasions to remind <gloss target="#t_PMGSE_1"
                                >PMGSE</gloss> officials already knowledgeable that Mengistu has
                            never taken up this offer. At a later date, we may wish to publicize our
                            offer of dialogue, if we feel that there is no chance of responsiveness
                            to quiet diplomacy.</p>
                        <p>4. While continuing emergency aid, and leaving the offer of dialogue on
                            the table, do not negotiate any resumption of regular foreign assistance
                            or other economic benefits outside the context of improved political
                            relations. We are obligated, legally and under Congressional pressure,
                            to respond to <gloss target="#t_PMGSE_1">PMGSE</gloss> offers to
                            negotiate specific compensation cases. But we should not set aside our
                            more fundamental objections to resuming a regular aid relationship.</p>
                        <pb facs="0698" n="652" xml:id="pg_652"/>
                        <p>5. Continue feeding programs to rebel relief groups across the Sudan
                            border, in spite of <gloss target="#t_PMGSE_1">PMGSE</gloss> protests,
                            but avoid supporting separatist aims of rebel organizations.</p>
                        <p>6. Stand firm on our public and private insistence on expanded feeding
                            programs in the north, and on refusing assistance to resettlement. Make
                            clear that <gloss target="#t_PMGSE_1">PMGSE</gloss> positions on these
                            issues are divisive and cruel to elements of the Ethiopian population.
                            Continue, as we are doing now, to internationalize pressures on the
                                <gloss target="#t_PMGSE_1">PMGSE</gloss> on this issue, calling on
                            the <gloss target="#t_UNSYG_1">UNSYG</gloss> and other donors to speak
                            out. Broadening our base in this way avoids charges of U.S. bullying and
                            gives us the high ground as well as the standing to speak out.</p>
                        <p>7. Make clear to the <gloss target="#t_PMGSE_1">PMGSE</gloss> leadership
                            that without dialogue we feel free to (a) make public our criticisms of
                                <gloss target="#t_PMGSE_1">PMGSE</gloss> shortcomings, (b) refuse
                            regular development assistance, and (c) make no moves to dissuade Sudan
                            or others from aiding Ethiopian rebel organizations.</p>
                        <p>These actions will have several effects. They will deepen our penetration
                            into and contacts with Ethiopian society. They will contrast sharply
                            Western aid with Soviet indifference and <gloss target="#t_PMGSE_1"
                                >PMGSE</gloss> policy failures. They will send a signal to
                            alternative leadership that there are clear and tangible benefits to
                            Ethiopia in an improved relationship with the West. And they will
                            intensify Mengistu’s defensiveness while continuing to tarnish his
                            image. If there is prospect for political change in Ethiopia, these are
                            the ways we can best promote it.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_SP_1">S/P</gloss> Comment:</hi> We
                            concur in this memo’s objective—to “intensify public pressure . . .

                                separate from the African Economic Initiative for policy reform.
                                However, as both programs are addressed to improvements in the
                                policy environment for economic growth, they could very well operate
                                in the same country. Food for Progress will be tied to reforms to
                                stimulate agriculture; the Economic Initiative could address other
                                reforms as well.</p>

                            <p rend="sectiontitleital">Factors Favoring this Recommendation:</p>
                            <p>—It would demonstrate the personal interest of the President through
                                appointment of a high level administrator. The President could
                                launch one of the early programs at the White House or through his
                                Special Administrator.</p>
                            <p>—It would assign day-to-day responsibility within the Agency
                                responsible for administering both emergency and non-emergency food
                                aid and other economic aid programs.</p>
                            <p>—The Agency for International Development can ensure that the program
                                retains its strong and unique focus on the objective of agricultural
                                policy reform and that Food for Progress, the African Economic <pb
                                    facs="0708" n="662" xml:id="pg_662"/> Policy Initiative and
                                regular <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> programs directed
                                toward such policy reform are mutually reinforcing.</p>
                            <p>—It would insulate the program from the sometimes cumbersome
                                consensus process of the established PL 480 programming process and
                                from the conflict of interests among agencies inherent in that
                                process.</p>
                            <p rend="sectiontitleital">Issues Raised by this Recommendation:</p>
                            <p>—Additional staff may be needed to support the Special Administrator.
                                    <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> believes that support staff
                                of one person would be sufficient as <gloss target="#t_AID_1"
                                    >AID</gloss> has regular staff experienced in analysing
                                agricultural policy and other economic issues and in administering
                                food aid programs. <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> would
                                coordinate with USDA on such operational matters as establishing the
                                Usual Marketing Requirement for the participating country and
                                identifying the most appropriate commodity mix.</p>
                            <p>—<gloss target="#t_OMB_1">OMB</gloss> and Treasury, both very active
                                in the Working Group of the Development Coordination Subcommittee
                                dealing with allocation of food aid, may want to be represented on
                                the interagency consultative group. The recommendation is intended
                                to include the agencies responsible for actual implementation of
                                food aid programs whose representatives overseas (Ambassador,
                                Agriculture Attache, <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> Director)
                                are likely to be active in formulating and negotiating the Food for
                                Progress agreement.</p>
                            <p>—A change in the authorizing legislation, the Agricultural Trade and
                                Development Act of 1954 as amended, would be required if the program
                                is funded by a transfer under Title I of the Act. The Development

                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">Summary</hi></p>
                        <p>Large parts of Africa are getting relief from the major continent-wide
                            drought. Above-normal rains have fallen in Africa south of the Equator
                            during the current growing season, and the first estimate of Zimbabwe’s
                            corn and sorghum crops is “excellent.” Rains have not yet returned to
                            the famine-stricken regions north of the Equator; they are not due until
                            June. However, the return of rain to the south offers reason to hope
                            that the big African drought is ending. Nonetheless, the Sahel<note

                                Niger, Senegal, and The Gambia. [Footnote is in the
                                original.]</note> may remain in the grip of its long dry cycle.</p>
                        <p>Even if rains return to famine areas in the north, food assistance will
                            continue to be crucial in holding down the death toll until displaced
                            populations can return to their land, crops are harvested, and food
                            stocks rebuilt. Equally important, unless the productivity of Africa’s
                            primitive agricultures can be raised in the next few years, the
                            continent’s high population growth rate could make its next drought even
                            more damaging than this one.</p>
                        <p>Weather experts now feel confident that the current drought was produced
                            by a global weather disturbance which began in 1983—a severe “southern
                            oscillation,” or El Nino (a global change in normal weather patterns
                            that often triggers drought in Africa). The continental drought was far
                            too extensive to have been caused by such localized phenomena as
                            deforestation and overgrazing, though these may have been accentuating
                            factors in the Sahel subregion.</p>
                        <p>Climatologists see no strong evidence that the continent is undergoing a
                            permanent climate change. Because Africa’s rainfall has always been
                            highly variable, with the average precipitation in many countries just
                            enough to grow crops, African farm production has always been highly
                            sensitive to marginal weather changes.</p>

                            criteria should be assessed for individual proposed country programs.
                            The criteria should be considered in the following general order of

                            request. To provide authority for the program, the Administration will
                            propose legislation to restructure Title III of P.L. 480 to provide for
                            the multi-year grant nature of the Food for Progress program. The

                            to any prospect that Mengistu has seen the light. The drought and famine
                            do not appear to have undermined Mengistu’s military power base, which
                            remains strong because of the strongly favored position of the military
                            in Ethiopia—and the continuing military assistance they receive from the
                            Soviets. After all, periodic famines have been with Ethiopia for
                            centuries. Despite our food aid, official criticism of the U.S. remains
                            strong and sometimes virulent. Mengistu recently announced a move toward
                            establishing a “People’s Democratic Republic of Ethiopia.”<note n="2"

                            studying the advantages of joining CEMA. While the U.S. can take pride
                            in its humanitarian impulse to save hundreds of thousands of Ethiopians
                            from starvation, there is no evidence that our generosity has moved
                            Mengistu and other hardliners one inch politically. As Ethiopian
                            barriers and food diversion remain, we should consider reducing FY 86

                        <p>Since Mengistu’s return, he has moved to reenergize the largely coercive
                            resettlement program (from the northern insurgent areas to the south),
                            and to begin a forced “villageization”, or collectivized agriculture
                            scheme. Mengistu’s domestic political and security priorities continue
                            to far outweigh Western famine relief operations. You have seen

                        <p>The U.S. is cutting food shipments to Ethiopia this year by about

                            about 300,000 tons, or one-third of Ethiopia’s famine relief needs. I
                            asked Frank Wisner last week to consider suspending all food relief

                            largely by priority given to military deliveries (we had also pressed
                            State hard for a formal demarche, to which they finally agreed).<note

                        <p>I still don’t like indirectly subsidizing or making it possible for
                            Mengistu, with Soviet support, to pursue coercive, collectivization
                            policies. The government’s northern offensive has been the most
                            successful in 25 years and food aid has helped to keep the offensive
                            operative through the rainy season. As you know, our Ethiopian food
                            assistance programs are controversial, with strong proponents for and
                            against. It is also politically sensitive on the <persName

                                <pb facs="0716" n="670" xml:id="pg_670"/> 86 program, although some
                            downward adjustment is possible. But I believe we should begin thinking
                            about terminating our food assistance programs to Ethiopia in FY 87,
                            assuming the good rains continue. We can argue that Ethiopia’s food
                            deficits are caused by failed Marxist collectivist/agriculture policies
                            which we refuse to support, rather than by the drought. The downside is
                            that the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> may take some heat
                            publicly for advocating such a position, but policy adjustments are now
                            necessary. We have little leverage on Mengistu, but we should not make
                            it easier for him to pursue pro-Soviet goals.</p>

                            situation in Ethiopia and our position here following eighteen months of
                            massive <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> emergency relief assistance
                            and recommends what our policy should be concerning <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> food assistance in 1987. It requests
                            that a high level interdepartmental group composed of all involved and
                            affected agencies be convened to consider the question of continuing a
                            significant <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> food assistance program
                            in Ethiopia in 1987, taking fully into account the important, highly
                            revelant considerations set forth herein. End summary.</p>
                        <p>3. Since its inception in late 1984 our large aid program in Ethiopia has
                            had a single, consistent purpose drought relief, which we have done most
                            effectively, bringing great credit to our country and people. Our
                            current aid strategy assumes this purpose will be fulfilled by the end
                            of 1986 and we will withdraw; presumably reverting back to the small,
                            “regular” feeding program we have maintained in Ethiopia since
                            terminating our aid development program in 1974.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d250fn2">An unknown hand highlighted this sentence and wrote
                                the word “<hi rend="italic">Yes</hi>” to the right of it.</note> If
                            there is a need owing to drought for relief aid beyond CY 86 we are
                            prepared to <pb facs="0717" n="671" xml:id="pg_671"/> consider it. This
                            strategy is fully consistent with our original, very limited objective
                            of joining with other friendly donor governments, international
                            organizations and NGOs in a purely humanitarian effort to meet the needs
                            of millions of Ethiopians whose lives were threatened by the drought
                            induced famine of the past two years.</p>
                        <p>4. In reality, though, our massive involvement and substantial aid
                            presence here over the past two years has also served other important
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> goals and objectives and
                            interests, not just in Ethiopia but throughout the Horn of Africa. Thus
                            a decision to terminate the program almost entirely has broader policy
                            implications which should be addressed by the <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> before we take definitive action. This message assesses
                            these implications to provide a basis for interagency deliberations and
                            decision making on the future of our aid program in Ethiopia.</p>
                        <p>5. To properly appreciate where we are now and where our relief aid has
                            brought us in Ethiopia we need to first look back to where we were. From
                            1977 to 1984 the U.S. was virtually isolated from Ethiopia. Our presence
                            here was confined essentially to limited [<hi rend="italic">less than 1
                                line not declassified</hi>] information gathering under very
                            difficult conditions and to occasional, pro forma diplomatic protest
                            making. Our small official Mission, unable to travel outside of Addis
                            Ababa (except for tours and recreational visits to Lake Langano), was
                            out of touch with the people of this country and with what was happening
                            in its vast, complex countryside. Despite the very friendly, almost
                            affectionate, regard of most Ethiopians for our country we did not
                            maintain with them the informational, educational and cultural ties that
                            we have sustained even with the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe and other
                            communist countries. Instead, we contented ourselves with condemning
                            their brutal, totalitarian government, while living with our
                            frustrations at being unable to influence or change it and striving to
                            limit the damage it might inflict on our interests in this strategically
                            important region of the world. Meanwhile, the Soviets and their allies
                            greatly expanded their presence and activities here, especially in the
                            military field. Some of our allies and friends (notably Italy and
                            Sweden) contested the territory but with only our encouragement and not
                            our assistance their modest efforts were no match for the Soviets. Not
                            surprisingly, as we became isolated from Ethiopia the country and its
                            people became increasingly isolated from us. In sum, we came to not
                            account for very much in Ethiopia. To compensate for this we greatly
                            increased our involvement in neighboring Sudan and Somalia trying to
                            make these nations our new bastions in the Horn despite difficulties in
                            insuring our presence and position in them over the longer term. This is
                            where the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> stood in Ethiopia when
                            the disastrous drought peaked in mid 1984.</p>
                        <p>6. Over the past two years our situation in Ethiopia and the Horn of

                                facs="0718" n="672" xml:id="pg_672"/> enabled us to not only touch
                            the lives of millions of Ethiopians but literally to save them. We
                            responded quickly when they needed us with what they most needed and
                            they know that: The Soviets did not and they also know that. To the
                            chagrin of the Politburo hardliners, scores of official and <gloss
                                target="#t_NGO_1">NGO</gloss> Americans are moving all over the
                            country, not only observing relief programs but also gathering
                            information on a variety of important subjects (such as resettlement,
                            villagization, local government, the military, etc) and making valuable
                            contacts with individuals and institutions, both governmental and
                            non-governmental. (In eight months I myself have officially visited 28
                            cities and towns in all geographic areas.) Riding in the expansive wake
                            of our relief program we have in a short time re-established the full
                            range of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> programs and begun to
                            reforge solid cultural and educational links with key sectors of this
                            emerging society. [<hi rend="italic">less than 4 lines not
                                declassified</hi>] Taking advantage of our position as the leading
                            donor, we have been the driving force behind an alliance of more than a
                            score of other friendly donors under <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_IO_1">IO</gloss> leadership which has
                            influenced this government, not only on behalf of the relief effort
                            (e.g. IBNET, port improvements, northern feeding) but also on other
                            important issues such as resettlement, refugees and agricultural
                            policies. Western donor reps in Addis are already expressing dismay at
                            the prospect of our withdrawing from this alliance, which would
                            disintegrate without us. In sum, we are no longer “isolated” from
                            Ethiopia but are once again actively involved, on the ground, with the
                            people in many important areas. While our enhanced presence and impact
                            here falls far short of our past overwhelming prominence, it is
                            nevertheless significant and productive in terms of our larger
                            political, strategic and security interests, particularly over the
                            longer run.</p>
                        <p>7. Although our return to Ethiopia has not yet led to tangible returns on
                            the big issues that concern us, the picture is not totally bleak.
                            Ethiopia remains in the grip of a small band of ruthless, Marxist
                            ideologues, though this grip has been perforce loosened somewhat.
                            Ethiopia is still solidly allied with the Soviet Union, though the past
                            year has seen this alliance subjected to both internal and external
                            pressures; and, the alliance with Libya, which troubled us so much in
                            the past, is now a shambles. Although the Mengistu regime still
                            threatens our Somali and Sudanese friends, these threats have been
                            contained and some initiatives toward negotiations with them have been
                            taken by Mengistu. Even internally there are some stirrings which give
                            rise to hope for the future of this troubled land. Foremost among these
                            is the agreement recently concluded between the <gloss target="#t_EEC_1"
                                >EEC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_PMGSE_1">PMGSE</gloss> on
                            agricultural policy reform which, if implemented, can have profound
                            implications for economic, social and possibly political change.<note

                        <p>8. We and our allies have had a limited but significant effect on these
                            favorable developments by virtue of our greater presence and involvement
                            in Ethiopia since late 1984. Even though we clearly are not running the
                            show here, we are now more a part of it. Although the <gloss
                                target="#t_PMGSE_1">PMGSE</gloss> does not respond as fully as we
                            would wish, even on some relief related issues, it usually listens and
                            seems increasingly to take us into account. Moreover, as the conflict in
                            the PDRY demonstrated, the Soviets do not always call the tune here,
                            especially when they encounter Ethiopian nationalism and plain
                            stubborness. In sum, while we certainly cannot be swept away by hope for
                            the future, the situation is not hopeless. There is in Ethiopia room for
                            maneuver, especially for those willing to be actively involved and to be
                            flexible, pragmatic and imaginative.</p>
                        <p>9. Taking the foregoing fully into account, I believe it would be a
                            mistake for us, at this juncture, to throw out the baby with the bath
                            water, abruptly withdrawing from the food assistance field in Ethiopia
                            and again isolating ourselves from this country and its people. I am not
                            suggesting that we extend development assistance to Ethiopia, which
                            clearly remains beyond the pale, nor that we continue a hugh feeding
                            program, unless such is required by drought conditions. But I do believe
                            that a significant U.S. food aid presence here beyond CY1986 would be
                            opportune in terms of the present and future situation in Ethiopia and
                            would serve important <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> political,
                            security and strategic objectives as well as continuing to satisfy <pb
                                facs="0720" n="674" xml:id="pg_674"/> legitimate humanitarian needs.
                            Fortunately, the ways and means for maintaining a food aid presence here
                            sufficient to serve our broader interests are at hand.</p>
                        <p>10. To continue to further our strategic, political and security
                            interests and advance our goals and objectives in Ethiopia and the Horn,
                            I recommend that we undertake in 1987 a Food Aid Program which combines
                            a moderately increased “regular” feeding program and a “residual relief”
                            program. Briefly, these would consist of:</p>
                        <p>(A) Regular Program: We anticipate receiving from CRS, CARE, Save the
                            Children, the Missionaries of Charity (<gloss target="#t_MC_1"
                                >MC</gloss>) and the Ethiopian Orothodox Church (<gloss
                                target="#t_EOC_1">EOC</gloss>) requests for a total of about 35 to
                            40 thousand metric tons of food for regular feeding. Funding these would
                            allow us to support in Ethiopia three very capable American PVOs (one of
                            whom, CRS, is linked with a superb local network), one of the world’s
                            most prestigious humanitarian organizations (the <gloss target="#t_MC_1"
                                >MC</gloss> of Mother Theresa, who has clout even with Mengistu) and
                            Ethiopia’s most important <gloss target="#t_NGO_1">NGO</gloss> (the

                            strengthened as a counter to Mengistu’s Marxists.) It would also give us
                            a widespread presence in nine of Ethiopia’s fourteen provinces (Eritrea,
                            Tigre, Gondar, Wollo, Showa, Hararghe, Bale, Wollega and Kaffa) and, we

                                concern about <persName corresp="#p_MMP_1">McPherson</persName>’s

                        <p>(B) Residual Relief: There are an estimated 900 thousand “pastoralists”
                            (mostly around the fringe of Ethiopia’s borders in Eritrea and Hararghe)
                            who will remain drought victims even if the rains are good because
                            little has been done to help restore the lost and debilitated herds on
                            which they depend for their livelihood. As indicated in Addis Ababa
                                1978,<note n="5" xml:id="d250fn5">Not found.</note> we also
                            anticipate continued drought and conflict related relief needs in the
                            provinces of Eritrea and Tigre currently being served by the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>’s food for the north (<gloss

                            which we have assumed a special responsibility. Finally, even if the
                            Meher rains are very good, we can expect that there will remain drought
                            affected pockets because (1) there will be some places where the rains
                            will not be good and (2) other factors, especially inadequate and
                            untimely availability of seeds, will prevent some areas from being able
                            to fully recover from the drought. These “pockets” could involve up to
                            one million people still in need of relief food. I believe we can count
                            on other Western donors to help meet these residual relief needs which
                            could total as much as 150 thousand <gloss target="#t_MT_1">MT</gloss>.
                            But there is no reason why we should not also continue to participate
                            roughly providing the one-third share we have to date. This would not
                            only serve our broader interests but also meet needs that are within our
                            original drought relief mandate. Moreover, by continuing to work with
                            other Western donors we will retain our membership and leadership role
                            within their various coordinating groups, which have proved useful to us
                            to date on a variety of issues, including resettlement.</p>

                        <p>Whether the U.S. should act to end hunger in Africa by 1) re-orienting
                            U.S. economic policies and programs to help end hunger through growth
                            and private enterprise development; 2) re-invigorating donor
                            coordination to this end; and 3) engaging the American public through a
                            communications campaign and a Private Initiative for Africa.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Background</p>
                        <p>The United States needs to act more forcefully to help the countries of
                            Sub-Saharan Africa to recover from the famine and the economic
                            stagnation which can cause future famines. Unless African governments
                            adopt growth policies which encourage food production and increase the
                            purchasing power of the poor, the African people will face the threat of
                            starvation, and the world will face festering political unrest which can
                            breed communist insurgencies.</p>
                        <p>Africa is at a crisis point, with the aftermath of famine exacerbating
                            the economic decline which helped to cause famine. Per capita income
                            fell by about 20 percent since 1980, despite increased assistance beyond
                            emergency relief. Every other region of the world—no matter how poor—has
                            expanded its ability to feed itself. Ironically, most African countries
                            possess the natural resources required to feed their people.</p>
                        <pb facs="0722" n="676" xml:id="pg_676"/>
                        <p>The principal causes of economic decline are policies which overvalue
                            currencies, set low producer prices, support public enterprise and state
                            marketing boards and discourage private sector development. The effects
                            of these policies are exacerbated by the pursuit of privilege and
                            corruption. Some have estimated that the equivalent of all official
                            development assistance to Africa is lost to corruption each year.</p>
                        <p>The major cause of hunger is poverty. African nations can overcome hunger
                            only if their economic decline is reversed, and the private sector is
                            encouraged to produce and market food and to undertake other
                            income-generating activities. In Africa, agriculture should be an engine
                            of growth, generating income and demand for secondary products among the
                            majority of people. Transportation, retailing, services, education and
                            finance all benefit from and contribute to a viable farm sector.</p>
                        <p>The American people sense Africa’s need. Spontaneously, millions have
                            responded generously to the African famine. But Americans know that the
                            root causes of famine have not been addressed. The timing of this
                            initiative is appropriate owing to the high degree of public interest,
                            the continuing economic decline in Africa and the reduction of U.S.
                            economic assistance to Africa by 20 percent this year.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Discussion</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Why Past Aid Has Not Solved the Problem.</p>
                        <p>First, <hi rend="italic">donor efforts are fragmented by inadequate
                                coordination and by competing internal economic and political
                                objectives</hi>. U.S. foreign aid is under pressure from many sides,
                            including farm groups concerned with the disposition of surplus food
                            stocks, universities for research grants and private voluntary
                            organizations. Politically, the U.S. generally seeks good will and
                            political support with less regard to the long term impact of our
                            assistance. The result is mixed signals and little growth.</p>
                        <p>Second, <hi rend="italic">many African governments oppose change</hi>.
                            Generally socialist, with elite privileges for those in power,
                            preservation of control is their over-riding interest. Many African
                            governments see the private sector as a threat, and as a loss of
                            opportunities for privilege and corruption. These tendencies reenforce
                            the institutional bias of donors to provide aid to governments—not the
                            people.</p>
                        <p>Third, <hi rend="italic">most aid goes to governments</hi>. This aid
                            fosters the growth of bureaucracies, not private enterprise. The
                            government conduit weakens conditionality; when reform fails to occur,
                            aid continues to flow for political reasons. A better balance between
                            aid flows to the African people (for development) and to their
                            governments (for political objectives) is needed.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">How to Achieve a Turnaround.</p>
                        <p>Three areas must be mobilized to achieve a turnaround: federal programs,
                            other donors and U.S. public opinion.</p>

                        <p>First, <hi rend="italic">focus federal programs</hi>. Under the <persName

                                <gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss> and World Bank to coordinate
                            growth policies in Africa as a way to resolve the debt problem.<note
                                n="2" xml:id="d251fn2">Reference is to the <persName

                                October 1985 in Seoul.</note> The U.S. also supports policy reform
                            in Africa through the African Economic Policy Initiative of 1984 and the
                            Food for Progress Act in the farm bill. These add-on programs have not
                            overcome the inertia of “business as usual.”</p>
                        <p>All U.S. assistance programs and policies, bilateral and multilateral,
                            must be effectively targeted toward growth, with a balance between
                            stabilization and private sector growth, and between medium and long
                            term impact on growth, if economic independence in Africa is to become a
                            reality. Current U.S. and other donor assistance programs are generally
                            oriented projects and investments which favor governments and public
                            enterprises.</p>
                        <p>We would achieve our objective by establishing a common goal for all
                            federal aid efforts: <hi rend="italic">End hunger in Sub-Saharan Africa
                                through economic growth and private enterprise development by the
                                end of the century</hi>. The level of aid provided to individual
                            countries would be affected by their willingness to adopt incentive
                            economic policies and private sector programs, with aid levels reduced
                            for those unwilling to undertake meaningful reform or to support aid
                            flows to the private sector. The implementation of this strategy would
                            be worked out through a <gloss target="#t_NSSD_1">NSSD</gloss> under
                            White House direction.</p>

                            other donors to join in a coordinated effort to help Africa achieve the
                            goal of ending hunger through economic growth and private enterprise
                            development by the end of the century.</p>

                            the future.<note n="2" xml:id="d253fn2">Not found.</note> I have

                            that the following course of action best serves overall U.S.
                            interests.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">1.</hi> NO EMERGENCY REQUIREMENT
                            FROM <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss></p>
                        <p>It is unlikely there will be any requirement for US emergency food aid in
                            FY 87. The weather in Ethiopia has been excellent. The recent small
                            harvest was fine, and the major harvest is promising.</p>
                        <p>During the last six months, emergency feeding levels have been lower than
                            anticipated. They will go up for the rest of the year, but there are
                            huge stockpiles of relief food. Even with increased deliveries to those
                            in need, we anticipate that at the end of this year there will be a
                            carryover of non-US relief food of between 350,000 to 450,000 <gloss
                                target="#t_MT_1">MT</gloss> of food. This quantity should be
                            adequate to meet all currently projected emergency needs. If there is a
                            large unanticipated deterioration in the situation we will have
                            sufficient time to respond. (This analysis does not cover our cross
                            border feeding efforts which rely on a different pipeline. To the extent
                            possible and as needed we will continue to provide food to the cross
                            border operation.)</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">2.</hi> MODEST REGULAR PROGRAM
                            FOR FY 87</p>
                        <p>A.I.D. will propose a modest regular feeding program of 18-22,000 <gloss
                                target="#t_MT_1">MT</gloss> for DCC consideration for FY 87. This
                            program will be implemented by a number of Private and Voluntary
                            Organizations (CARE, CRS, SCF, Ethiopian Orthodox Church, Missionaries
                            of Charity and, possibly, <gloss target="#t_WVRO_1">WVRO</gloss>).
                            Before 1985 the regular feeding program with CRS was about 12,000 <gloss
                                target="#t_MT_1">MT</gloss>. To manage the program we will locate a
                            personal services contractor who would be in place in Addis Ababa by
                            March of 1987. The full A.I.D. mission will close at that time and the
                            current United State Direct Hire (<gloss target="#t_USDH_1"
                            >USDH</gloss>) staff will not be replaced. Monitoring from our regional
                            office in Nairobi will continue.</p>
                        <p>On developmental grounds, there is little justification for any regular
                            program. The proposed program will achieve modest recovery and
                            humanitarian objectives. It will allow PVOs to move away from emergency
                            feeding and will serve other U.S. interests by enabling A.I.D. and
                            Embassy staff to travel throughout Ethiopia to monitor the
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>Under our proposal, all of the organizations, except CRS, are getting
                            close to what they want. The CRS request for FY 87 was 28,000 <gloss
                                target="#t_MT_1">MT</gloss>. We propose they receive 6,000 <gloss
                                target="#t_MT_1">MT</gloss>, about half of the current regular
                            program they have in Ethiopia this year. If they are the cooperating
                            sponsor for Mother Theresa’s Missionaries of Charity, CRS would also
                            receive an additional 3,000 <gloss target="#t_MT_1">MT</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>For their regular Title II programs, sponsoring agencies have
                            traditionally paid internal transport charges. Some of the agencies
                                consider<pb facs="0727" n="681" xml:id="pg_681"/>ing programs within
                            this framework have indicated an unwillingness to bear such costs in
                            Ethiopia. Legislative prohibitions limit our flexibility on this issue.
                            Therefore, those agencies unwilling to accept the internal transport
                            burden can not participate in a regular program. There would be
                            corresponding reductions in the level of the program.</p>
                        <p>We will monitor the situation. If there is a need to revise this strategy
                            we will advise your staff.</p>

                            <p>1. Economic Assistance. Identify African government policies needed
                                to promote growth through private enterprise; identify policies to
                                improve the impact of stabilization programs on private enterprise
                                and economic growth; identify options or strategies for broadening
                                the benefits of policy reform for the majority of the people; assess
                                role of government and U.S. support to the public sector; identify
                                policies and programs to stimulate local private sector response to
                                growth opportunities and rural linkages; identify optimal blend of
                                assistance, e.g. program/project/<gloss target="#t_PVO_1"
                                    >PVO</gloss>/food aid/central programs, for different country
                                debt/growth situations. (U)</p>
                            <p>2. Debt Management. Develop programs and policies whereby U.S.
                                actions on outstanding and new debt are leveraged to reenforce
                                growth and private enterprise; identify programs and policies to
                                support African efforts to manage their debt; identify policies for
                                rescheduling, new lending, grant vs. loan assistance and arrears;
                                identify structural causes of budget deficits and policies and
                                programs to address these; identify <pb facs="0731" n="685"

                                debt burden; develop a strategy to enlist the support of other
                                creditors. (U)</p>
                            <p>3. Food Aid Policy. Determine how U.S. agricultural resources can be
                                used as incentives for economic growth; maximize food aid and
                                current food stocks to generate resources for Sub-Saharan Africa,
                                consistent with the President’s goal of regional food
                                self-sufficiency; consider monetization of food aid, food for work,
                                use of local currency generation, policy dialogue, and role of food
                                aid in promoting intraregional trade; determine which food aid
                                vehicles (Titles I, II, III, Food for Progress, Section 206) are
                                appropriate to specific development objectives. (U)</p>

                                Identify optimal contribution of U.S. private sector for growth in
                                Africa; identify policies to increase U.S. trade and investment with
                                Africa, including consideration of special trade incentives for
                                low-income countries; identify options for U.S. government agencies
                                to better support U.S. private business involvement in Africa;
                                identify administrative and legislative adjustments needed to
                                improve the contribution of the U.S. private sector to Africa’s
                                growth. (U)</p>
                            <p>5. Multilateral Diplomacy and Implications for U.S. Foreign Policy.
                                Identify a framework for enhanced donor coordination on broad policy
                                and program issues; assess relative priority of economic growth with
                                other U.S. political and strategic objectives in Africa; given that
                                economic pluralism is a prerequisite for political pluralism and
                                democracy, identify options for U.S. support to political regimes
                                which do not foster private sector growth policies leading to
                                equitable growth; identify strategy for making shift to countries
                                which support private enterprise and growth. (C)</p>
                            <p>6. Budget Allocation. Develop a structure of budget presentation and
                                implementation that will ensure that 1) budget allocations for the
                                region are evaluated on the basis of the President’s goal by both

                        <p>When we started this project last fall, the task seemed overwhelming.
                            Many of us wondered whether we would be able to cover so many areas in
                            such a short period of time—and still produce something of benefit. We
                            have. The implementation plan we developed, if followed, will create a
                            structure that will be the framework of U.S. economic policy for Africa
                            for years to come. This could be a true turning point.</p>
                        <p>If so, it is because of the spirit of commitment and compromise displayed
                            by everyone on the Task Force. We thank you for making this a rewarding
                            and successful enterprise.</p>
                        <p>The next step to implement the President’s decision is to prepare the
                            Executive Order that will empower the new Coordinating Committee for
                            Sub-Saharan Africa. A draft, based directly upon the Task Force report,

                            <p>In June 1986, you established a goal<note n="6" xml:id="d256fn6">See
                                        <ref target="#d251">Document 251</ref>.</note> for all U.S.
                                economic policies and programs for Sub-Saharan Africa: “<hi
                                    rend="italic">end hunger in Sub-Saharan Africa through economic
                                    growth and private enterprise development by the end of this
                                    century</hi>.” As components of this goal, you directed that the
                                level of aid provided a given country be directly related to its
                                willingness to promote the private sector, that the help of other
                                donors be coordinated toward the same goal, and that the U.S.
                                private sector and public opinion be mobilized.</p>
                            <p>This report constitutes the implementation plan you requested the
                                National Security Council and the Office of Policy Development to
                                prepare. A National Security Study Directive was issued and an
                                interagency task force, consisting of 15 departments and agencies,
                                developed this plan under a joint <gloss target="#t_NSC_1"

                            <p>Your initiative is the first comprehensive, systematic U.S. program
                                for Sub-Saharan Africa which has been designed to focus donor,
                                recipient, and multilateral economic activities on the same goal. In
                                short, there has never before been a program presented to the
                                Congress which—if adopted by Africans and donors alike—would give
                                such assurance that the tragic problems of that region might be
                                significantly eased. This report outlines such a program. The Task
                                Force believes that a comprehensive program would be more saleable
                                and popular than any individual proposal.</p>
                            <p>The goal of the Task Force was to develop a <hi rend="italic">policy
                                    structure which would improve the effectiveness of our programs
                                    regardless of the level of funds available</hi>. Even at current
                                resource levels, the program will enhance <pb facs="0734" n="688"
                                    xml:id="pg_688"/> the effectiveness of U.S. and other donor
                                assistance and has the potential for saving future expenditures
                                which would be required for relief in the event future famine
                                occurs.</p>
                            <p>It is important to note that the other donor nations and the African
                                governments in the region tend to judge the seriousness of the
                                American commitment by the level of our funding and not the level of
                                our rhetoric. Today, Sub-Saharan Africa needs both policy reform and
                                more resources, but those resources can be generated in many
                                ways—from export earnings, foreign investment, foreign aid, or in
                                other ways. The World Bank projects that the region needs an
                                additional $1.5 billion per year—other estimates are as high as $4
                                billion—beyond the $8 billion now provided in total foreign
                                assistance, if there were no increase in the effectiveness of aid,
                                no increase in exports, and no easing of its debt problem.</p>
                            <p>All agencies participating in the Task Force agree, however, that
                                just giving Sub-Saharan Africa more food and money without policy
                                changes would cause more harm and human suffering. We believe that
                                foreign assistance can and must be made more effective in
                                stimulating economic growth and income generation among the region’s
                                poor. To be effective, any policy focused on growth will require
                                substantial policy reform. Countries undertaking difficult reforms
                                will be able to generate additional resources and use those
                                resources more effectively to speed up the development process.</p>

                            <p>Sub-Saharan Africa is the poorest and least developed region in the
                                world. Its economic problems, however, are not just a result of the
                                region’s poor physical endowments but have been exacerbated by
                                government policies which served to stifle, not promote, economic
                                growth. Policy decisions kept exchange rates too high and interest
                                rates too low—often below the rate of inflation. Government
                                bureaucracy became the vehicle for allocating credit and access to
                                foreign exchange. Trade barriers proliferated. Government pricing
                                policies and marketing boards forced the farmers to subsidize urban
                                populations. In short, government entered virtually every phase of
                                economic activity, foreclosing opportunities for private sector
                                enterprise and growth.</p>
                            <p>High commodity prices masked the effects of these policies for years.
                                But, when the inevitable price cycle turned downward, the results of
                                these misdirected policies were predictable. Low-income Sub-Saharan
                                Africa invested an average of 19 percent of GDP through the 1970s.
                                Rather than produce growth, as it did elsewhere, investment in <pb

                                decline. The 1960’s growth rate of 3.6 percent fell to 2.3 percent
                                in the 1970s and 0.7 percent in the 1980s. Agriculture was
                                particularly hard hit. Per capita food production fell by 3 percent
                                a year from 1973 onward, while the rest of the world was increasing
                                food output. Finally, exports dropped by 14 percent <hi
                                    rend="italic">in real terms</hi> at a time when world trade

                            <p>The sad truth is that Sub-Saharan African countries as a whole, and
                                low-income nations of the region in particular, are less able to
                                feed themselves today than they were at independence. Indeed, over
                                the past two decades, per capita food production has plummeted by
                                about 20 percent in contrast to Asia and Latin America where per
                                capita food production has been steadily increasing as illustrated
                                in Graph 1. The daily calorie supply in low-income Sub-Saharan
                                African countries as a percentage of requirements was 13 percent
                                below that of all low income countries worldwide before the recent
                                famine.</p>

                            <p>Map 1 shows that all but 10 countries in the region were existing on
                                less than 100 percent of daily food requirements in pre-famine 1982
                                even when food aid was included. The actual impact was much worse in
                                rural areas, given the propensity to support urban areas and the
                                poor distribution system in most countries. By comparison,
                                industrial market economies averaged about 133 percent of required
                                daily caloric intake. Even before the famine, some 44 percent of all
                                Africans consumed fewer calories each day than the <gloss

                            <p>This poor performance, however, has begun to turn around. Improved

                                combined with better post-drought weather to improve agricultural
                                production in 1985 and 1986. While data are still incomplete, at
                                least 10 countries show a surplus in coarse grains in 1986. Zambia
                                has increased agricultural output by about 30 percent over the last
                                three years.</p>
                            <p>Map 2 presents <gloss target="#t_GNP_1">GNP</gloss> per capita in
                                U.S. dollars in 1984—the year that the most recent famine began. As
                                can be seen, at least 19 countries had per capita GNPs below $300
                                per year, as compared to an average of $11,060 for all industrial
                                market economies for the same period. However, even these figures
                                understate the actual poverty of rural areas since most of the
                                wealth is concentrated in the cities.</p>

                            <p>Although solid data are yet to be aggregated, informal indications
                                are that the underlying economic base in Sub-Saharan Africa has
                                weakened since the famine. Indeed, Sub-Saharan African countries
                                will have to do a great deal just to stay in the same place they
                                find themselves in today. At the current population growth rate of
                                3.2 percent a year, food supply for the region would have to double
                                in less than 22 years and quadruple by the year 2025 just to
                                maintain the current level of food availability and caloric
                                supply.</p>
                            <p>Even the most optimistic forecasts anticipate a decline in per capita
                                income for the region over the next 10 years. In addition, according
                                to the World Bank, the region’s debt burden prior to rescheduling
                                will continue to grow, with most of its available financing
                                dedicated to stabilizing current arrearages, not promoting
                                growth.</p>

                                Scarce foreign exchange is consumed by debt servicing. Paying for
                                past mistakes leaves little to produce economic growth. Without
                                rescheduling, debt service on existing obligations will consume some
                                40 percent of all export earnings through 1990 for the low-income
                                Sub-Saharan African countries. For seven countries (Sudan, Somalia,
                                Madagascar, Mali, Zambia, Tanzania, and Guinea-Bissau), the debt
                                service burden without rescheduling will be greater than 50 percent
                                of export earnings. Even some countries with a much lower debt
                                service ratio have difficulty meeting their obligations. For both
                                Zaire and Liberia (debt service ratios of 24.1 and 20.8 percent,
                                respectively) servicing past debt consumes more than 50 percent of
                                their national budgets. Proportionally, for these countries, this is
                                a greater challenge than the one confronting either Brazil or
                                Mexico.</p>
                            <p>The debt burden seems even greater when one realizes that the source
                                of hard currency—<hi rend="italic">exports</hi>—is a weak base. The
                                simple fact is that Sub-Saharan Africa is heavily dependent on
                                commodity exports to generate foreign exchange for debt servicing.
                                Approximately 87 percent of its total export revenues are generated
                                by commodities such as copper, gold, oil, coffee, and cotton. By
                                comparison, the other low-income countries of the world are able to
                                generate more than 50 percent of their export earnings from
                                manufactured goods. Thus, the region has been especially vulnerable
                                to developments in primary commodity markets. Continued weakness in
                                these markets has translated into a prolonged decline in the overall
                                volume of exports from the region. It has also meant an erosion of
                                profitability in the export sector; average unit value for
                                Sub-Saharan Africa has dropped 18 percent since <pb facs="0740"

                                commodity markets weaken over the period 1973–1983, but Sub-Saharan
                                Africa as a whole lost ground to other producing nations and regions

                                leaders in the region uniformly accepted responsibility for failed

                                agricultural development.</p>
                            <p>These commitments were not made lightly. The price of economic reform
                                can be high in political terms. Gambia, for example, has just begun
                                to streamline its bloated bureaucracy—by reducing its civil service
                                by 24 percent. Thus, some of the best educated citizens have been
                                dumped without pensions, unemployment insurance, or a private sector
                                to provide jobs. In the U.S. this would equate to about 500,000
                                federal employees. Zaire, Somalia, and Zambia have taken similarly
                                difficult actions to devalue currency, realign exchange rates, and
                                ease internal price controls and regulations. Austerity measures in
                                Zaire have been so stringent, that it has had negative growth for
                                the last five years. While this report was being written, Zambians

                                past six years. The Administration has put into effect the <persName

                                Africa to spur reform efforts.</p>
                            <p>But now the Africans are calling our bet. They have said: we will

                            <p>1. It must sustain and reward performance, while penalizing the lack
                                of it.</p>
                            <p>2. It must represent a truly long-term commitment from both the
                                donors and Sub-Saharan Africans. It cannot be a short-term fad. It
                                must be a mature development partnership.</p>
                            <p>3. It must allow the cooperating governments to get through their
                                cash and political crises as austerity measures hit home.</p>
                            <p>4. Reform must proceed at a pace that, although meaningful, is not

                            <p>Implicit in these four tests is a fifth: the bulk of the donors must
                                speak as one. That is, they must conduct their programs to a common
                                purpose in a common structure.</p>

                            <p>The international system of providing aid to Sub-Saharan Africa has
                                grown significantly since independence. However, this assistance is
                                largely government-to-government aid with little common purpose and
                                often feeble conditionality. By and large, it is not yet equipped to
                                deal with the crisis confronting Sub-Saharan Africa today.</p>
                            <p>The U.S. program has expanded assistance to the private sector both
                                directly and, most importantly, through pushing for liberalized
                                economic policies that unfetter the private sector. However, there
                                are still too many special interests and concerns reflected in the
                                U.S. program. These markedly reduce our flexibility to respond fully
                                to the rapidly evolving environment in Africa.</p>
                            <p>In too many cases, we still find support programs whose dominating
                                concerns reflect the needs and capacity of the donor and creditor
                                agencies, rather than the demands of the reform process. To cite
                                only a few examples:</p>
                            <p>—Food assistance programs have by and large tended to reflect donor
                                needs and commercial interests with scant attention to their impact
                                on recipient country reform and development programs. As a
                                consequence, real agricultural incentives for production are
                                undercut. In response to this evolving situation, the <gloss
                                    target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> has cut its FY 1987 food aid
                                program in Somalia in half and is looking to substitute commodities
                                    <pb facs="0742" n="696" xml:id="pg_696"/> which do not compete
                                with Somalia’s newly reinvigorated agricultural sector. Other food
                                donors have been less responsive.</p>
                            <p>—Debt management policies have remained focused almost exclusively on
                                short term financial crises, to the exclusion of any consideration
                                of longer term solutions for creditor nations. The unfortunate truth
                                is that for most debtor countries, debt reschedulings remain the
                                only debt management tool, even in cases where it is plain that
                                countries will never be able to retire their debt. Zaire’s debt, for
                                instance, has increased substantially, almost entirely as a result
                                of regular repeated reschedulings. For Zambia, Sudan and Somalia,
                                the problem is much the same.</p>
                            <p>—Bilateral programs have at times been poorly focused, dominated by
                                short term political considerations, and/or offered on terms and in
                                forms inappropriate to the adjustment efforts underway in these
                                Sub-Saharan African countries. In Sudan and Liberia, for instance,
                                U.S. assistance was offered in support of clearly insubstantial
                                adjustment programs. Similarly, Italian and European Community aid
                                to Ethiopia has tended to substitute for, rather than to support,
                                reform. But, largely with U.S. and World Bank leadership, there are
                                also a growing number of programs, such as in Zambia and Malawi,
                                which have been focused clearly and directly on adjustment and
                                growth efforts.</p>
                            <p>—Multilateral institutions have had difficulty in dealing with
                                Sub-Saharan Africa’s circumstances. Africa’s combination of
                                macroeconomic and structural difficulties cuts across institutional
                                responsibilities. Close collaboration among international financial
                                institutions has, in many cases, just begun in an effective way.
                                Enhanced collaboration is needed if the financial system is not to
                                become a drain on resources in Sub-Saharan Africa, especially in
                                countries such as Sudan, Liberia, Zambia, Zaire, and Ghana.</p>
                            <p>In other cases, institutional rigidities have blocked effective
                                action. Inflexible budgetary processes, for instance, have often
                                left us and other donors locked into bilateral aid commitments and
                                programs whose justification has been lost or, more often, overtaken
                                by higher priority needs. Functional accounts within the development
                                assistance budget, for instance, are a product of the “basic human
                                needs” strategy of the 1970s.<note n="9" xml:id="d256fn9">Reference
                                    is to the congressional focus on “basic human needs” that began
                                    in 1973.</note> Unfortunately, such a structure is completely
                                inappropriate for the 1980s, undercutting our capacity to deliver
                                timely and appropriate assistance to countries undertaking major
                                policy reforms, even in cases where those reforms are geared to
                                redressing policy abuses which have punished the poor.</p>
                            <p>Finally, aid coordination has remained a problem. Too often,
                                bilateral and multilateral programs have run at cross purposes. The
                                U.S. <pb facs="0743" n="697" xml:id="pg_697"/> has been less guilty
                                of this than other donors. In fact, we have done more over the past
                                five years to promote donor coordination than any other donor.
                                Nevertheless, even in our own programs, incidents have occurred
                                where coordination has broken down. For instance, attempts to
                                privatize food marketing in Kenya failed in part because of poor
                                coordination between the United States, the World Bank, and the
                                    <gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss>. Similarly, in Somalia,
                                efforts to develop an efficient and effective public investment
                                program were frustrated by Italian refusals to adapt their aid
                                programs to the overall context defined by the World Bank.</p>
                            <p>The consequence of these factors—inefficient programs, inflexible
                                institutional arrangements, and poor aid coordination—has been to
                                leave us crippled when facing the multitude of problems in
                                Sub-Saharan Africa today.</p>

                                has built the base which makes a new initiative possible.</p>
                            <p>In spite of the progress of the last few years, U.S. economic
                                policies and programs, like those of other donors, are still focused
                                on a multiplicity of purposes. Beginning in 1973, U.S. assistance
                                was dominated by a Congressional philosophy of “basic human needs.”
                                Yet, when the need was so great, it was too easy to focus only on
                                easing the suffering of the moment. With each need and new fad,
                                another special interest group was formed and yet another program
                                was developed. Many now operate inefficiently with limited
                                coordination between programs or to the national economy. The result
                                has been to limit flexibility in setting or reaching a goal of
                                ending hunger based upon economic growth.</p>
                            <p>Ironically, the system created in the name of human needs has become
                                self-serving. It is not now responsive to the needs of the
                                Sub-Saharan African people. For the past 15 years, approximately 90
                                percent of all U.S. assistance to the region went to governments.
                                While this percentage has begun to decline somewhat in recent years,
                                much more needs to be accomplished to enhance the environment for a
                                stronger private sector.</p>

                                effort is needed if we are to have a prospect of ending hunger in
                                Sub-Saharan Africa by the end of this century through economic
                                growth and the development of private enterprise. Ending hunger in
                                this context means an economy sufficiently strong that it can meet
                                the food needs of its citizens through local food production and, as
                                necessary, commercial purchases of food on the world market. An
                                economy which meets this test need never fear a famine.</p>
                            <p>Qualifications, however, are necessary. Vanquishing the specter of
                                famine in Sub-Saharan Africa will require that:</p>
                            <p>—governments in the region actively promote the private sector, ease
                                their control of the economy, and sustain their recent efforts at
                                economic reform;</p>
                            <p>—major donors, led by the U.S., place economic growth as their first
                                priority, and focus their efforts toward that end; and</p>
                            <p>—we recognize that the fight to end hunger will not be won in every
                                case but, rather, in the overall context of what can be achieved on
                                a regional basis. The condition of individual countries will
                                continue to vary widely with some progressing more rapidly than

                            <p>In crafting a comprehensive program to implement your policy goal,
                                the Task Force concluded that only a special effort for Sub-Saharan

                                the barriers to growth. The heart of the special effort would be to
                                erect a policy and budget fence around Sub-Saharan Africa for all
                                U.S. assistance programs and activities. Outside the fence, this

                                priority and the standard by which all U.S. actions are judged.</p>
                            <p>The specific proposals discussed below are presented in that context.
                                They are intended to create a special policy for Sub-Saharan Africa
                                without affecting our policies and programs for any other region of
                                the world. Each of the proposals is designed to contribute to at
                                least one of the four program characteristics we believe necessary
                                to achieve your goal:</p>
                            <p>1. All U.S. economic policies and programs for Sub-Saharan Africa
                                should be consistent with your goal.</p>
                            <p>2. The policy, budget, and program structure available to the U.S.
                                for each Sub-Saharan African country should be tailored to the exact
                                needs of that country to optimize achievement of the goal.</p>
                            <pb facs="0745" n="699" xml:id="pg_699"/>
                            <p>3. The level and form of U.S. policies and programs should be
                                directly related to the degree of active policy cooperation from the
                                Sub-Saharan African countries.</p>
                            <p>4. The U.S. should “speak with one voice” in its dealing with the
                                multilateral organizations, with Sub-Saharan African governments and
                                with other donors on economic issues for the region.</p>
                            <p>Consistent with these characteristics, the Task Force has developed a
                                comprehensive program designed to have the maximum impact on the
                                other donors and African countries in the region. This program
                                envisions a refocusing of objectives to ensure more effective use of
                                existing resources to reach your goal; it also proposes forthright
                                actions and solutions. It will, however, require recognition that
                                there is a projected continuing resource gap that must be narrowed
                                either through increased exports, debt relief, enhanced aid and
                                investment, or some combination of those factors if we are to
                                achieve growth for the entire region. None of these areas presents
                                easy choices.</p>

                                emphasize longer-term cooperation tied to progress toward achieving
                                economic reforms; non-project lending and assistance where possible;
                                reduction of tied aid requirements among the donors; support for the

                                significant progress has been made toward developing compacts where
                                all donors agree with interested Sub-Saharan African governments on
                                an overarching macroeconomic structural adjustment <pb facs="0746"
                                    n="700" xml:id="pg_700"/> framework, coordinated through the
                                Bank and Fund, the <gloss target="#t_UNDP_1">UNDP</gloss>, or other
                                appropriate mechanisms, to establish country targets for growth and
                                economic reform. It is important to strengthen this process. Policy
                                Framework Papers and Public Investment Programs would be based on
                                these general agreements, and would provide the operational building
                                blocks for donor cooperation with Sub-Saharan African nations.
                                Existing donor project portfolios would be adjusted to support
                                agreed country strategies. The final report of the United Nations
                                General Assembly special session sets forth such a long-term
                                framework for the African continent as a whole. This effort is
                                remarkably consistent with our vision of where Sub-Saharan Africa
                                development should go at the country level. In this regard, it is
                                encouraging to note that Kenya has already developed a 15-year
                                development framework. Finally, donors must be willing to cut back
                                aid when recipient countries do not meet objectives in these
                                compacts.</p>

                                ensure that markets remain open, and that protectionist pressures
                                are not allowed to stymie the process of economic development. In
                                addition, the United States should encourage countries in the region
                                to fully exploit current opportunities under the Generalized System
                                of Preferences. Moreover, the United States should highlight to the
                                U.S. private sector those African countries which provide adequate
                                investor protection. OPIC insurance and financing programs,
                                including the proposed Africa Growth Fund, should be used to support
                                direct investment in Sub-Saharan Africa for those countries which
                                comply with U.S. investment policy principles.</p>

                                substantially to humanitarian relief and economic growth in Africa.
                                This private involvement should be encouraged to expand to help meet

                                should seek ways to expand U.S. business involvement by targeting

                            <p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">ASSESSMENT OF THE PROGRAM</hi></p>
                            <p>The Task Force believes that this program represents the best
                                opportunity to assist countries in Sub-Saharan Africa to end hunger
                                by the end of this century. It is a framework which will offer the
                                greatest inducement to both the countries in the region and the
                                other donors to promote economic growth. Even with optimal
                                implementation of this program, hunger may not be eliminated in
                                every country. Nevertheless, the past performance of several
                                countries attests to the possibility of sustainable economic growth
                                in Sub-Saharan Africa when the economic environment is conducive to
                                such growth. Botswana’s economic growth has exceeded 10 percent per
                                year since 1963; growth in Rwanda and Swaziland has exceeded 5
                                percent per year. Even <pb facs="0750" n="704" xml:id="pg_704"/>
                                countries with the most statist traditions have recently
                                demonstrated that liberalization of their economies can have a
                                strong and positive economic impact. Zambia’s agricultural
                                production has grown by almost 30 percent in three years after a
                                decade of decline and industry grew by 9 percent last year. The
                                prospect of widescale famine certainly can be eliminated.</p>
                            <p>The Task Force’s implementation plan will position the U.S. to
                                provide effective leadership for the donor community to focus
                                economic policies and programs to more effectively support
                                structural adjustment and economic growth in Africa. The program
                                will provide greater flexibility in the application of resources
                                committed to Africa while providing consistent criteria: reform,
                                private sector development and economic growth. This is essential to
                                stimulate broad-based growth, without which hunger cannot be
                                overcome. At the same time, focusing our assistance efforts on those
                                countries that are effectively helping themselves will have
                                important demonstration effects in Africa, and here in Washington in
                                the competition for scarce budgetary resources.</p>
                            <p>Finally, the program is predicated on a long term goal, which can be
                                met only with a consistent commitment of resources. The separate
                                account will help shield Sub-Saharan Africa from the effects of
                                budget cuts imposed by Congress as long as economic growth in
                                Sub-Saharan Africa remains a high priority. Currently, the bulk of
                                funding comes from development assistance funds reserved for
                                low-income countries. Therefore, this treatment does not distort aid
                                funding in support of other U.S. foreign policy objectives.</p>

                        <p>The meher season suffered from prolonged dry spells in many regions at

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Food Aid.</p>
                        <p>Walter Bollinger of A.I.D. reported on the work of the food aid working
                            group chaired by A.I.D. He thanked the working group for a series of
                            productive meetings. He reported that the group did not support a
                            legislative option for an Africa food fund, analogous to the Development
                            Fund for economic assistance. It did, however, agree to a package of
                            management and allocation changes to the existing DCC food aid process,
                            aimed at more effective use of African food aid for policy reform.</p>
                        <p>These changes include: 1) expedited decision-making for a priority list
                            of countries; 2) development of policy reform criteria by which to
                            determine priority countries; 3) greater concessionality (i.e., more use
                            of Title III and Section 206); 4) multiyear programming; and 5) payment
                            of ocean freight for the most debt-distressed countries.</p>
                        <p>The working group also agreed to develop specific targets or benchmarks,
                            in many cases quantitative, for judging progress in the implementation
                            of these changes.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Bollinger mentioned two other issues that had been discussed in the
                            working group. One was the importance of quick approval of new
                            simplified guidelines for Title III. The other was the trade-off between
                            emergency and development uses of food aid in Africa, and the
                            possibility of sharing the burden of African emergencies globally.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Bollinger proposed two actions for a follow-on meeting of the
                            Coordinating Committee in June:<note n="5" xml:id="d258fn5">Under a July

                        <p>1) The working group will develop benchmarks for the agreed changes in
                            the current process, and present them to the Coordinating Committee for
                            approval.</p>
                        <p>2) A.I.D. will develop a legislative proposal for food aid, which the
                            committee can consider for possible recommendation to the next
                            administration (e.g., for possible inclusion in the 1990 reauthorization
                            of the farm bill).</p>
                        <p>Owen Cylke of A.I.D., who had chaired one of the food aid working group
                            meetings, added two points to Mr. Bollinger’s presentation. First, he
                            felt that most of the potential for improvement was in Title I/III,
                            because of the structural constraints in Title II (the mandated
                            sub-minimum for private voluntary organizations). Second, he thought it
                            was important to have the working group report to the Coordinating
                            Committee on implementation of the proposed changes on an on-going
                            basis.</p>
                        <pb facs="0754" n="708" xml:id="pg_708"/>
                        <p>Walter Barrows said that he felt that the working group’s analysis of
                            needed changes in the food aid program was excellent, and that he hoped
                            the food fund concept<note n="6" xml:id="d258fn6">In a May 11 paper, a
                                working group provided a report to the Coordinating Committee on a

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WA_1">Woods</persName> said that A.I.D. would
                            pursue the food fund idea, but that there was not a lot of enthusiasm
                            among others for the legislative option. As a practical matter, he
                            noted, any legislative action would have to be in the next
                            administration. He noted <gloss target="#t_OMB_1">OMB</gloss>’s concern
                            about earmarking, and said that he shared that concern. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_WA_1">Woods</persName> said that he felt it was
                            important to develop a legislative proposal for the next administration,
                            and that A.I.D. would work on that.</p>
                        <p>Jon Rosenbaum raised the problem that a permanent food fund might
                            conflict with trade agreements in the area of food security that are
                            being considered in the <gloss target="#t_GATT_1">GATT</gloss>
                            negotiations. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WA_1">Woods</persName> said that
                            this should be looked into.</p>
                        <p>Philip DuSault said that, in his view, the review of food aid had been
                            constructive, and that there were some things that could be done now. He
                            stated that there were problems with the proposed use of non-food
                            commodities, and that this issue was to be addressed at the subcommittee
                            level of the DCC.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DMA_1">Michael Driggs</persName> said that the
                            purpose of food aid changes should be to improve management and
                            effectiveness, not just to increase resource levels. He asked whether
                            the short-term option being considered covered everything that could be
                            done to make food aid more effective without new legislation. Mr.
                            Bollinger answered that, in his opinion, it did.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DMA_1">Driggs</persName> also suggested that it
                            would be desirable to identify the constraints that the current
                            legislation imposes. Mr. Bollinger said that A.I.D. would do that as
                            part of its work on the longer-term option.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WA_1">Woods</persName> said that there was one
                            issue that was not definitively addressed in the proposed short-term
                            option—the trade-off between emergency food and use of food for
                            development. He felt that was an important problem to look at.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DuSault said that, in his view, the notion that there is a trade-off
                            between use of food for emergency and development is a misperception. He
                            cited figures showing that the share of food aid going for development
                            has been fairly constant over the years, with both emergency and
                            development levels increasing in FY85 and both declining since.</p>
                        <pb facs="0755" n="709" xml:id="pg_709"/>
                        <p>Mr. Bollinger argued that the 1985 figures are not representative because
                            there was a substantial supplemental appropriation for emergencies that
                            year. In years without emergency supplementals, he argued, there is a
                            one-for-one trade-off between emergency and development dollars.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SJA_4">Roy Stacy</persName> said that the
                            Initiative envisioned increased use of Section 206 in Africa, and that
                            this will not be possible under the current system. This is one reason
                            why a food fund is needed in the long term.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DuSault said that we are not out of money yet in FY88, that the Title
                            II reserve is about $40 million, and that emergency needs in Afghanistan
                            should only take about half of that. Thus, if there is no further demand
                            in Ethiopia, there could be additional resources available.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Cylke said that there are other problems with using this money in
                            Africa. First, A.I.D. has to have predictability in food aid programs if
                            it is to engage in serious policy dialogue with African governments.
                            Development programs cannot be designed at the last minute. Second,
                            there is a $40 million shortfall in the <gloss target="#t_PVO_1"
                                >PVO</gloss> sub-minimum, which means that much of the remaining
                            money will go to <gloss target="#t_PVO_1">PVO</gloss> projects, for the
                            most part in other areas of the world.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Investment.</p>
                        <p>Rodney Bent of <gloss target="#t_OMB_1">OMB</gloss>, co-chair with Gerald
                            West of the investment working group, reported on two proposals that had
                            been examined by the working group:</p>
                        <p>1) An OPIC proposal for feasibility studies and other assistance to
                            American firms interested in investing in Africa. (This issue was
                            discussed at the last Coordinating Committee meeting.)</p>
                        <p>2) An OPIC proposal to develop, in coordination with A.I.D., an
                            enterprise development zone (or free trade zone) in a single African
                            country and to promote the concept in other African countries.</p>
                        <p>Mr. West added the following comments on the investment encouragement
                            program:</p>
                        <p>—Policy reform is crucial for Africa to become an attractive investment
                            environment, but positive inducements for policy reform are needed.</p>
                        <p>—The cost of the feasibility study program is only about $750,000 in
                            FY89, which is not a large amount, even if an offset is required in the
                            150 account.</p>
                        <p>—In the FY82–85 period $58 million of new investment was generated
                            worldwide for about $2 million expended for investment encouragement
                            programs like those being proposed for Africa. Ten percent of the
                            programs resulted in actual investments. Given that those programs <pb
                                facs="0756" n="710" xml:id="pg_710"/> were focused on small business
                            and in the least developed countries, this was a good success rate.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Bent said that <gloss target="#t_OMB_1">OMB</gloss>’s main objection
                            to the investment encouragement program was to the additional budget
                            cost, and that a trade-off within OPIC’s existing budget would be a
                            different matter. Concerning the proposal for an enterprise development
                            zone, Mr. Bent noted that such zones had been tried unsuccessfully in
                            several African countries, and that only Mauritius was a success story.
                            He also suggested that such a program might be more appropriately
                            pursued by A.I.D.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GCL_1">Gladson</persName> responded that
                            several missions (Kenya and others) were looking at the free trade zone
                            concept as part of A.I.D.’s private sector plan, and that A.I.D. would
                            be happy to work with OPIC in this area.</p>
                        <p>Matt Hennesey of Treasury observed that both proposals seemed
                            constructive, but raised a question concerning the relationship between
                            a free trade zone and broader attempts to influence the policy
                            environment: Could a free trade zone divert attention from reform of the
                            system as a whole, which should be the main objective?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WA_1">Woods</persName> responded that a free
                            trade zone could have a demonstration effect, and thus support, rather
                            than conflict with, broader policy reform. Mr. West reinforced this
                            point, noting that selection of a country in which to create a free
                            trade zone would be based in part on policy reform performance, thus
                            creating some leverage for reform.</p>
                        <p>Larry Saiers of A.I.D. argued that the value of free trade zones in
                            Africa is that they are simpler way to promote trade, compared to other
                            methods such as rebates on export taxes or tariff changes, which are
                            administratively complex.</p>
                        <p>Jon Rosenbaum said that he felt the free trade zone proposal was an
                            excellent idea. He noted that similar programs in the Caribbean were
                            working well, after initial problems. However, such programs have
                            encountered political criticisms in the U.S. over the question of
                            subsidizing foreign investment in countries where labor practices may be
                            exploitative. Mr. Rosenbaum suggested that any Africa program should
                            take account of this domestic concern.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Bent and Mr. West said that they would continue working on the
                            investment encouragement and free trade zone issues. Mr. West said that
                            he would consult with OPIC management on whether or not to bring the
                            investment encouragement and enterprise zone issues before OPIC’s Board
                            of Directors, which is meeting on June 7.<note n="7" xml:id="d258fn7">No

                                announced an Initiative to End Hunger in Africa. You took this step
                                in response to the famine of 1985, and a new spirit of economic
                                reform on the part of Africa’s leaders.</p>
                            <p>Your Initiative was based on the principles that:</p>
                            <p>1. Hunger has to be attacked at its roots, the lack of long-term
                                economic development and growth.</p>
                            <p>2. To achieve real growth, African countries will have to reform
                                their economic policies and develop their private sectors.</p>
                            <p>3. To support African reform, bilateral and multilateral aid donors
                                have to follow a coordinated and long-term development strategy.</p>
                            <p>This is a report on the status of your Initiative, and on Africa’s
                                economic situation and future prospects.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="italic">Conclusions</hi>. Our principal conclusions are
                                that:</p>
                            <p>—Africa must cope with severe economic problems, resulting from
                                adverse external economic developments, droughts that have led to
                                disastrous famines, deficient government economic policies, and a
                                fundamental lack of physical and human resources.</p>
                            <p>—In recent years famines have been dealt with through substantial
                                emergency assistance. Africa also faces a long-term food gap,
                                however. Population and food needs are growing faster than
                                production. If current trends continue, Africa will have a large
                                food deficit by the year 2000. Food aid from the U.S. and other
                                developed countries will help, <pb facs="0759" n="713"
                                    xml:id="pg_713"/> but the only way to avoid this tragedy is to
                                substantially increase agricultural productivity and economic
                                growth.</p>
                            <p>—Because of its high rate of population growth (3% a year), Africa
                                has to achieve high economic growth (5–6% a year) to make real gains
                                in per capita income. This is much higher than past growth in
                                Africa.</p>
                            <p>—Such growth cannot be achieved without fundamental economic policy
                                reform in Africa and sustained financial support from the developed
                                world.</p>
                            <p>—In the last few years African leaders have recognized the necessity
                                of reform. Showing commendable courage, many have taken difficult
                                steps to implement reforms, often with high political costs. For
                                some countries, these efforts are beginning to pay off in increased
                                economic growth.</p>
                            <p>—In 1987 the developed countries agreed to provide additional capital
                                to Africa through international financial institutions to further
                                support economic reform. This assistance should meet the financing
                                needs of the heavily-indebted African countries that make a real
                                reform effort, and provide for some real growth through 1990.</p>
                            <p>—We will reinforce these efforts and continue to help the Africans
                                meet their longer-term development needs through our economic
                                assistance.</p>

                                and horrified by the scenes of African famine in 1984–85. They
                                responded with a generous outpouring of private donations and
                                government aid, which significantly reduced the loss of human
                                life.</p>

                                relief may be more difficult, primarily because of political
                                factors. In Ethiopia the government is denying access to relief
                                workers and giving higher priority to fighting the civil war than to
                                feeding the people. In Mozambique a virulent guerrilla war is
                                blocking relief in parts of the country.</p>

                                current famine emergencies, Africa faces a long-term food problem,
                                rooted in the perilous balance between population and food
                                production.</p>
                            <pb facs="0760" n="714" xml:id="pg_714"/>
                            <p>Africa’s population has been growing faster than agricultural output
                                for the last 20 years. Sometime in the 1970’s Africa passed the
                                point where it could meet its food needs from internal
                                production.</p>
                            <p>It has the highest population growth rate in the world, about 3% a
                                year. At this rate Africa’s need for food will double in the next 22
                                years. However, if current trends continue, food production will not
                                grow fast enough to keep up with demand, leaving a growing “food
                                gap.” Africa will become even more dependent on imported
                                food—commercial imports and food aid.</p>
                            <p>The problem is that some African nations will soon need such large
                                amounts of imported food that it is not clear where it will come
                                from. Africa’s economies are not growing fast enough to pay for the
                                needed food on commercial terms, without diverting large amounts of
                                foreign exchange from crucial investment. And no one, in Africa or
                                in the West, wants to see Africa permanently dependent on massive
                                food aid, even if the developed world could afford to provide
                                it.</p>
                            <p>Thus Africa still faces a long-term food crisis. The scope of the
                                problem is indicated by recent figures from the International Food
                                Policy Research Institute (<gloss target="#t_IFPRI_1"
                                >IFPRI</gloss>). <gloss target="#t_IFPRI_1">IFPRI</gloss> estimates
                                that, if past trends continue, Africa will have a food deficit of 47
                                million metric tons by the year 2000. This is four times the amount
                                of food that Africa currently receives from outside.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="italic">The Imperative of Growth</hi>. In dealing with
                                Africa’s food problems, both immediate and long-term, it is
                                important to attack the root of the problem—Africa’s lack of
                                development and growth. The only way to end hunger in Africa on a
                                sustainable basis is to increase production and growth on the
                                continent, so that Africans can feed themselves.</p>
                            <p>That is the aim of the End Hunger Initiative—to address the cause of
                                hunger through growth. Our approach is to promote reform of Africa’s
                                economic policies, supported by coordinated assistance from the
                                developed world.</p>
                            <p>To understand why this formula has been chosen, one must go back and
                                look at the history of Africa’s economic crisis and what it is going
                                to take to deal with it.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="italic">Roots of the Crisis</hi>. Africa’s economic crisis
                                began in the 1970’s with the oil price rises. The crisis worsened in
                                the early 1980’s, due to the global recession and a precipitous drop
                                in the prices of primary commodities, Africa’s main exports. These
                                problems were compounded by the effects of widespread drought in
                                1984 and 1985, as well as long-term environmental degradation.</p>
                            <p>At first, the African countries relied on borrowing abroad for
                                resources, but these funds were often used to maintain imports for
                                    <pb facs="0761" n="715" xml:id="pg_715"/> consumption or for
                                unproductive investments. Eventually, the servicing of their debts
                                became an additional burden on African countries.</p>
                            <p>Bad domestic economic policies and structures were also an important
                                factor in the African countries’ decline. Almost across the board,
                                African governments after independence set up statist economic
                                systems, which stifled economic production and growth. Government
                                policies were characterized by state-controlled prices, excessive
                                subsidies to urban consumers and burdens on rural agricultural
                                producers, overvalued exchange rates, and inefficient parastatal
                                corporations.</p>
                            <p>The people of Sub-Saharan Africa were hit hard by the economic
                                decline. By the mid 1980’s, the living standards of most countries
                                in the region had regressed to the levels they had at the time of
                                independence, nearly 30 years before.</p>
                            <p>One manifestation of this decline was a fall in per capita production
                                of food. Because of high population increases, slow growth in
                                agricultural production, and environmental degradation, per capita
                                food production fell by an average of 3% a year from 1972 to 1983.
                                This contrasts with the record in Asia and Latin America, where per
                                capita food production rose over the same period.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="italic">The Policy Reform Movement</hi>. In the early
                                1980’s there was a growing realization that substantive changes in
                                government policies and economic structures of the African countries
                                were required if they were to achieve real growth. This new thinking
                                started in the donor community. It gave rise to a new approach to
                                development, called “structural adjustment” or “policy reform.”</p>
                            <p>The basic concept behind the structural adjustment/policy reform
                                approach is that fundamental changes in economic policies and
                                structures will result in more efficient use of resources and, in
                                turn, greater economic growth. Reform measures are typically aimed
                                at such objectives as making markets work better, correcting past
                                biases against agriculture, and allowing the private sector to
                                develop and function more freely.</p>
                            <p>Policy reform gained growing acceptance among the donors from 1980
                                on, with the United States playing a lead role. By 1986 African
                                leaders themselves came to the conclusion that the old system was
                                unworkable, and strongly endorsed the idea of reform at the <gloss

                            <p><hi rend="italic">Difficulty of Reform</hi>. Implementation of reform
                                has proven to be difficult. Part of the problem is that the changes
                                needed are fundamental and far-reaching in scope. They often cause
                                large dislocations with immediate costs.</p>
                            <p>Also, governments undertaking reforms generally have to operate under
                                very adverse economic conditions resulting from past decline. <pb
                                    facs="0762" n="716" xml:id="pg_716"/> They face major
                                constraints on domestic resources and foreign exchange, and sharply
                                depressed levels of personal income. These conditions make reform
                                much more painful.</p>
                            <p>Many governments have demonstrated, however, that they have the
                                political courage to persist with difficult reform programs. They
                                have met and withstood pressures from groups in their societies,
                                including politically powerful interests.</p>
                            <p>In many cases, the commitment to reform is sustained by the
                                recognition that failure to reform now will necessitate much larger
                                adjustments later and that the short-term costs are outweighed by
                                the long-term benefits.</p>
                            <p>Concerns have been raised about the short-term impact of reform
                                programs on the poor in particular. Some have criticized policy
                                reform as regressive. In fact, policy reform itself is
                                overwhelmingly progressive—favoring small-holder farmers, who make
                                up the majority of the poor in Africa, and focusing losses on
                                government employees and urban elites.</p>
                            <p>Most of the costs to the poor have been due not to market-oriented
                                reforms, but to cutbacks in consumption and government spending
                                required to adjust to past depressed growth. Multilateral and
                                bilateral donors are instituting programs to ameliorate the impact
                                of such measures on the poor.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="italic">International Response</hi>. Recognizing both the
                                imperative of economic reform and the reforming countries’ need for
                                financial support, the donor community agreed in 1987 to a number of
                                initiatives to provide increased assistance to African countries
                                pursuing reform programs.</p>
                            <p>Under its Special Program for Africa, the World Bank increased its
                                allocation of concessional resources for 17 heavily-indebted African
                                countries that are undertaking reforms. The bilateral donors also
                                agreed to provide $3 billion in additional program aid, to be
                                extended in cooperation with the World Bank.</p>
                            <p>In addition, the African Development Bank received increased funding
                                for Africa, and the <gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss> established
                                an expanded $8 billion soft loan facility that will go mainly to
                                Africa, the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (<gloss
                                    target="#t_ESAF_1">ESAF</gloss>).</p>
                            <p>These programs combined will give these countries about $3 billion
                                more per year for the next three years, which will allow them to
                                increase critical import levels for the first time in this
                                decade.</p>
                            <p>Even before the recent steps to increase resources, there were signs
                                that policy reform was paying off. Africa made modest economic gains
                                in 1985 and 1986 (although there was back-sliding in 1987).</p>
                            <p>Countries which have sustained reform programs—such as Ghana, Guinea,
                                Gambia, and Senegal—had significant economic growth of <pb
                                    facs="0763" n="717" xml:id="pg_717"/> some 4% a year during
                                1986–87. Countries not pursuing economic reform posted much lower
                                growth rates, of less than 1% a year. Likewise, food production rose
                                more rapidly in countries pursuing economic reforms than in those
                                that did not.</p>
                            <p>Various factors, including improved weather and positive developments
                                in the industrial countries, contributed to these gains, but the
                                improved policy environment deserves a great deal of credit.</p>
                            <p rend="sectiontitleital">Africa’s Prospects.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="italic">Continuing Problems</hi>. Today Africa is at an
                                uncertain stage. The previous decline has been slowed, but a
                                decisive turn-around has not been achieved. It is hoped that the new
                                resources will allow Africa to make greater gains over the next five
                                years, and the World Bank is predicting modest per capita income
                                gains.</p>
                            <p>However, even if there is progress overall, problems will
                                persist.</p>
                            <p>First, future gains will not be evenly distributed. The new resources
                                will be targeted on countries that are making serious reforms. At
                                present this leaves a number of countries outside the system, either
                                because they haven’t joined the reform movement, have fallen off the
                                reform wagon, or are too far in arrears on debt to be helped. Thus
                                we may have growing variation in Africa, with progress by some and
                                continuing decline by others.</p>
                            <p>Second, even if there is general economic advance in Africa, there
                                may be recurring periods of famine. Famine is going to continue in
                                Mozambique as long as most of the country is engulfed in war. And in
                                Ethiopia famine will continue, and probably get worse, as long as
                                military conflicts persist and as long as the Ethiopian government
                                continues to follow bankrupt agricultural policies. If Ethiopia
                                doesn’t change these policies, it will face a permanent and growing
                                food deficit.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="italic">The Longer Term</hi>. Africa’s long-term prospects
                                are brighter now but also uncertain. With its population growth rate
                                of 3% a year, the African countries have to achieve high economic
                                growth (5–6% a year) to make significant gains on a per capita
                                basis. And they will have to sustain this high level of growth for
                                many years if they are to reach the levels of personal income that,
                                in other areas of the world, have been associated with declining
                                birth rates and a faster pace of development.</p>
                            <p>This is far above what African countries have achieved in the past
                                (on average, 1–2% growth over the last 15 years). Clearly there will
                                have to be a change in the way they do business, to achieve a major
                                increase in productivity and growth.</p>
                            <p>This is why sustained commitment to reform on the part of Africa and
                                a sustained program of assistance from the West, the precepts of the
                                End Hunger Initiative, are so important. Nothing less will have a

                            <p>Even with reform and outside help, Africa will face a tough battle.
                                Policy reform is not a quick fix. It involves fundamental and
                                complex changes, and will have to be continued for many years.
                                Greater attention will have to be paid in future years to improving
                                the working of agricultural and financial markets, spurring domestic
                                and foreign investment, and expanding Africa’s export capacity.</p>
                            <p>Moreover, Africa will have to overcome some of the most daunting
                                obstacles to development in the world: underdeveloped
                                infrastructure, a shortage of educated people, worsening
                                environmental deterioration, entrenched attitudes on family size,
                                and the <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> epidemic. All told,
                                Africa is clearly the development challenge of our time.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="italic">Content</hi>. Ending hunger in Africa through
                                economic growth is a very ambitious goal. It will require determined
                                efforts by Africa’s leaders and its people and coordinated programs
                                by Western donors for many years.</p>
                            <p>The End Hunger Initiative commits the United States to an active role
                                in this effort. Although our own budget problems at home limit the
                                additional resources we can contribute at this time, there are
                                definite steps that the U.S. can and will take:</p>
                            <p>—First, we will continue to stress the importance of policy reform
                                and private sector development in our own programs, and, to the
                                extent we have influence, in the programs of the World Bank and
                                other international financial institutions.</p>
                            <p>—Second, we will continue to work with the World Bank and others to
                                improve the coordination of multilateral and bilateral assistance
                                for Africa.</p>
                            <p>—Third, we are examining the full range of U.S. policies that affect
                                Africa—aid, food aid, debt, and trade and investment policies—to
                                ensure that they are contributing as much as possible to Africa’s
                                long-term development.</p>
                            <p>—Fourth, we are encouraging the involvement of U.S. businesses and
                                private voluntary organizations in Africa.</p>
                            <p>A special inter-agency coordinating committee has been created in the
                                Executive Branch to oversee the Initiative’s implementation. This
                                committee is chaired by the Administrator of A.I.D. and co-chaired
                                by the Deputy Secretary of the Treasury; it includes senior
                                representatives from all agencies that have programs affecting
                                Africa.</p>
                            <p>The following actions have been taken, or are underway, to support
                                the goals of the Initiative. (A detailed summary of actions taken

                            <p><hi rend="italic">U.S. Economic Assistance</hi>. The End Hunger
                                Initiative called for a more flexible assistance tool to deal with
                                Africa’s problems. In fiscal year 1988 Congress established a new
                                Development Fund for Africa, which will provide more constancy in
                                Africa funding and allow A.I.D. greater flexibility in the
                                management of its Africa programs. Congress also increased Africa
                                funding moderately, in spite of a decline in foreign aid
                                overall.</p>
                            <p>A.I.D. will use the flexibility of the Development Fund to:</p>
                            <p>—Make U.S. assistance more performance-based by shifting resources to
                                countries and programs where results are being achieved.</p>
                            <p>—Integrate non-project and project aid in a more coherent
                                package.</p>
                            <p>—Continue support for critical long-term programs in child survival
                                and health, population, environment, and agriculture.</p>
                            <p>During fiscal years 1988 and 1989 significant changes will be made in
                                the allocation of U.S. assistance, increasing aid to countries that
                                are undertaking economic reform, and reducing aid to countries that
                                are not.</p>
                            <p>The Development Fund will also allow A.I.D. to tailor its programs
                                more closely to the needs of individual countries. This involves
                                coordinating project and non-project aid, including food aid;
                                addressing both policy problems and technological constraints in key
                                sectors; and opening up opportunities for people and
                                non-governmental organizations working at the grass-roots level.</p>
                            <p>A.I.D. will not duplicate the macroeconomic activities of the World
                                Bank and the <gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss>. Instead it will
                                focus its policy reform efforts on the sectoral level (especially
                                agriculture), where policy changes have to be integrated with
                                grass-roots development. This is an area where A.I.D., with its
                                experienced in-country staffs, has a comparative advantage.</p>
                            <p>A.I.D. is also exploring methods for expanding private sector
                                activity, particularly by improvements in financial markets.</p>
                            <p>Finally, because of their overwhelming importance for Africa’s
                                long-term development, A.I.D. is placing special emphasis on
                                programs for family planning, natural resource protection, and
                                sustainable agriculture.</p>
                            <p>Five new population projects will be started in Africa next year.
                                Major new natural resource management activities have been begun.
                                    <pb facs="0766" n="720" xml:id="pg_720"/> In agricultural
                                research A.I.D. is playing a key role in funding national, regional,
                                and international research institutions, and in cooperating with the
                                World Bank in coordinating donor programs.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="italic">Debt</hi>. Various international actions have been
                                taken to ease Africa’s debt burden. These include extensive
                                rescheduling of bilateral debt through the Paris Club, extension of
                                grace periods and easing of repayment terms in the Paris Club, and
                                forgiveness by some donors.</p>
                            <p>The greatest help in this area will be through additional resources,
                                provided by the programs cited earlier for assisting
                                debt-distressed, reforming countries (increased funds from the World
                                Bank and African Development Bank, the new donor commitments of
                                program aid, and the <gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss>
                                <gloss target="#t_ESAF_1">ESAF</gloss>).</p>
                            <p>At the recent Toronto Economic Summit the major developed countries
                                agreed to ease debt servicing burdens of the poorest, most heavily
                                indebted countries by allowing official creditors greater
                                flexibility in Paris Club reschedulings. Under this approach, as
                                part of a Paris Club rescheduling, creditors could write off debt,
                                reschedule at concessional interest rates, or provide longer
                                maturities.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="italic">Donor Coordination</hi>. U.S. assistance to Africa
                                represents only about 8% of total developed country economic
                                assistance to the region. Therefore, it is vitally important for the
                                U.S. to work with other bilateral donors and multilateral lenders.
                                For this reason, better coordination of programs and greater
                                consensus on the need for policy reform are central elements of the
                                Initiative.</p>
                            <p>Progress has been made in both areas. Coordination of regular donor
                                programs has improved in the last year due to increased efforts by
                                the World Bank and the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                                Development Programme, actively supported by the United States. And
                                the World Bank is taking a strong lead in coordinating the
                                newly-committed program aid. Today the policy reform movement has
                                achieved a broad consensus of support among the donors.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="italic">Food Aid</hi>. The United States made some progress
                                in fiscal year 1988 in improving the use of food aid to support
                                development and policy reform in Africa, although these efforts were
                                hampered by the large levels of food required for emergency relief
                                last year. The Coordinating Committee is looking at ways to increase
                                the effectiveness of food aid in Africa in 1989 and beyond.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="italic">Conclusion</hi>. The goal of ending hunger in
                                Africa is daunting, but not impossible. Twenty years ago people
                                thought that hunger would never be ended in India, yet that country
                                is now self-reliant in food.</p>
                            <p>The development challenge in Africa is a long-term one, but the End
                                Hunger Initiative is an important first step. It will have to be
                                continued by future administrations.</p>
                            <pb facs="0767" n="721" xml:id="pg_721"/>
                            <p>We hope that the Initiative will help mobilize and unite people
                                around a truly worthy goal—the sustainable end to hunger in
                                Africa.</p>
