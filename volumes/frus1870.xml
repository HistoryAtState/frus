                <head>Message of the President of the United States.</head>
                <p><hi rend="italic">To the Senate and House of Representatives:</hi></p>
                <p>A year of peace and general prosperity to this nation has passed since the last
                    assembling of Congress. We have, through a kind Providence, been blessed with
                    abundant crops, and have been spared from complications and war with foreign
                    nations. In our midst comparative harmony has been restored. It is to be
                    regretted, however, that a free exercise of the elective franchise has, by
                    violence and intimidation, been denied to citizens in exceptional cases in
                    several of the States lately in rebellion, and the verdict of the people has
                    thereby been reversed. The States of Virginia, Mississippi, and Texas have been
                    restored to representation in our national councils. Georgia, the only State now
                    without representation, may confidently be expected to take her place there also
                    at the beginning of the new year; and then, let us hope, will be completed the
                    work of reconstruction. With an acquiescence on the part of the whole people in
                    the national obligation to pay the public debt, created as the price of our
                    Union; the pensions to our disabled soldiers and sailors, and their widows and
                    orphans; and in the changes to the Constitution which have been made necessary
                    by a great rebellion, there is no reason why we should not advance in material
                    prosperity and happiness, as no other nation ever did, after so protracted and
                    devastating a war.</p>
                <p>Soon after the existing war broke out in Europe the protection of the United
                    States minister in Paris was invoked in favor of North Germans domiciled in
                    French territory. Instructions were issued to grant the protection. This has
                    been followed by an extension of American protection to citizens of Saxony,
                    Hesse and Saxe-Coburg, Gotha, Colombia, Portugal, Uruguay, the Dominican
                    Republic, Ecuador, Chili, Paraguay, and Venezuela, in Paris. The charge was an
                    onerous one, requiring constant and severe labor, as well as the exercise of
                    patience, prudence, and good judgment. It has been performed to the entire
                    satisfaction of this Government, and, as I am officially informed, equally so to
                    the satisfaction of the government of North Germany.</p>
                <p>As soon as I learned that a republic had been proclaimed at Paris, and that the
                    people of France had acquiesced in the change, the minister of the United States
                    was directed by telegraph to recognize it, and <pb n="4" xml:id="pg_4"
                        facs="0038"/>to tender my congratulations and those of the people of the
                    United States. The re?stablishment in France of a system of government
                    disconnected with the dynastic traditions of Europe appeared to be a proper
                    subject for the felicitations of Americans. Should the present struggle result
                    in attaching the hearts of the French to our simpler forms of representative
                    government, it will be a subject of still further satisfaction to our people.
                    While we make no effort to impose our institutions upon the inhabitants of other
                    countries, and while we adhere to our traditional neutrality in civil contests
                    elsewhere, we cannot be indifferent to the spread of American political ideas in
                    a great and highly civilized country like France.</p>
                <p>We were asked by the new government to use our good offices, jointly with those
                    of European powers, in the interests of peace. Answer was made that the
                    established policy and the true interests of the United States forbade them to
                    interfere in European questions jointly with European powers. I ascertained,
                    informally and unofficially, that the government of North Germany was not then
                    disposed to listen to such representations from any power, and though earnestly
                    wishing to see the blessings of peace restored to the belligerents, with all of
                    whom the United States are on terms of friendship, I declined, on the part of
                    this Government, to take a step which could only result in injury to our true
                    interests, without advancing the object for which our intervention was invoked.
                    Should the time come when the action of the United States can hasten the return
                    of peace, by a single hour, that action will be heartily taken. I deemed it
                    prudent, in view of the number of persons of German and French birth living in
                    the United States, to issue, soon after official notice of a state of war had
                    been received from both belligerents, a proclamation, defining the duties of the
                    United States as a neutral and the obligations of persons residing within their
                    territory, to observe their laws and the laws of nations. This proclamation was
                    followed by others, as circumstances seemed to call for them. The people, thus
                    acquainted, in advance, of their duties and obligations, have assisted in
                    preventing violations of the neutrality of the United States.</p>
                <p>It is not understood that the condition of the insurrection in Cuba has
                    materially changed since the close of the last session of Congress. In an early
                    stage of the contest the authorities of Spain inaugurated a system of arbitrary
                    arrests, of close confinement and of military trial, and execution of persons
                    suspected of complicity with the insurgents, and of summary embargo of their
                    properties, and sequestration of their revenues by executive warrant. Such
                    proceedings, so far as they affected the persons or property of citizens of the
                    United States, were in violation of the provisions of the treaty of 1795 between
                    the United States and Spain. Representations of injuries resulting to several
                    persons claiming to be citizens of the United States, by reason of such
                    violations, were made to the Spanish government. From April 1869 <pb n="5"
                        xml:id="pg_5" facs="0039"/>to June last the Spanish minister at Washington
                    had been clothed with a limited power to aid in redressing such wrongs. That
                    power was found to be withdrawn, “in view,” as it was said, “of the favorable
                    situation in which the Island of Cuba” then “was;” which, however, did not lead
                    to a revocation or suspension of the extraordinary and arbitrary functions
                    exercised by the executive power in Cuba, and we were obliged to make our
                    complaints at Madrid. In the negotiations thus opened, and still pending there,
                    the United States only claimed that, for the future, the rights secured to their
                    citizens by treaty should be respected in Cuba, and that, as to the past, a
                    joint tribunal should be established in the United States, with full
                    jurisdiction over all such claims. Before such an impartial tribunal each
                    claimant would be required to prove his case. On the other hand, Spain would be
                    at liberty to traverse every material fact, and thus complete equity would be
                    done. A case which, at one time, threatened seriously to affect the relations
                    between the United States and Spain has already been disposed of in this way.
                    The claim of the owners of the Colonel Lloyd Aspinwall, for the illegal seizure
                    and detention of that vessel, was referred to arbitration, by mutual consent,
                    and has resulted in an award to the United States, for the owners, of the sum of
                    nineteen thousand seven hundred and two dollars and fifty cents, in gold.
                    Another and long pending claim of like nature, that of the whaleship Canada, has
                    been disposed of by friendly arbitrament during the present year. It was
                    referred, by the joint consent of Brazil and the United States, to the decision
                    of Sir Edward Thornton, her Britannic Majesty’s minister at Washington, who
                    kindly undertook the laborious task of examining the voluminous mass of
                    correspondence and testimony submitted by the two governments, and awarded to
                    the United States the sum of one hundred thousand and seven hundred and forty
                    dollars and nine cents, in gold, which has since been paid by the imperial
                    government. These recent examples show that the mode which the United States
                    have proposed to Spain for adjusting the pending claims is just and feasible,
                    and that it may be agreed to by either nation without dishonor. It is to be
                    hoped that this moderate demand may be acceded to by Spain without further
                    delay. Should the pending negotiations, unfortunately and unexpectedly, be
                    without result, it will then become my duty to communicate that fact to Congress
                    and invite its action on the subject.</p>
                <p>The long deferred peace conference between Spain and the allied South American
                    republics has been inaugurated in Washington under the auspices of the United
                    States. Pursuant to the recommendation contained in the resolution of the House
                    of Representatives, of the 17th of December 1866, the Executive Department of
                    the Government offered its friendly offices for the promotion of peace and
                    harmony between Spain and the allied republics. Hesitations and obstacles
                    occurred to the acceptance of the offer. Ultimately, however, a conference was
                        <pb n="6" xml:id="pg_6" facs="0040"/>arranged, and was opened in this city
                    on the 29th of October last, at which I authorized the Secretary of State to
                    preside. It was attended by the ministers of Spain, Peru, Chili, and Ecuador. In
                    consequence of the absence of a representative from Bolivia the conference was
                    adjourned until the attendance of a plenipotentiary from that republic could be
                    secured, or other measures could be adopted toward compassing its objects.</p>
                <p>The allied and other republics of Spanish origin, on this continent, may see in
                    this fact a new proof of our sincere interest in their welfare; of our desire to
                    see them blessed with good governments, capable of maintaining order and of
                    preserving their respective territorial integrity; and of our sincere wish to
                    extend our own commercial and social relations with them. The time is not
                    probably far distant when, in the natural course of events, the European
                    political connection with this continent will cease. Our policy should be
                    shaped, in view of this probability, so as to ally the commercial interests of
                    the Spanish American States more closely to our own, and thus give the United
                    States all the preeminence and all the advantage which Mr. Monroe, Mr. Adams,
                    and Mr. Clay contemplated when they proposed to join in the Congress of
                    Panama.</p>
                <p>During the last session of Congress a treaty for the annexation of the Republic
                    of San Domingo to the United States failed to receive the requisite two-thirds
                    vote of the Senate. I was thoroughly convinced then that the best interests of
                    this country, commercially and materially, demanded its ratification. Time has
                    only confirmed me in this view. I now firmly believe that the moment it is known
                    that the United States have entirely abandoned the project of accepting, as a
                    part of its territory, the Island of San Domingo, a free port will be negotiated
                    for by European nations in the Bay of Samana. A large commercial city will
                    spring up, to which we will be tributary without receiving corresponding
                    benefits, and then will be seen the folly of our rejecting so great a prize. The
                    government of San Domingo has voluntarily sought this annexation. It is a weak
                    power, numbering probably less than one hundred and twenty thousand souls, and
                    yet possessing one of the richest territories under the sun, capable of
                    supporting a population of ten millions of people in luxury. The people of San
                    Domingo are not capable of maintaining themselves in their present condition,
                    and must look for outside support. They yearn for the protection of our free
                    institutions and laws; our progress and civilization. Shall we refuse them?</p>
                <p>The acquisition of San Domingo is desirable because of its geographical position.
                    It commands the entrance to the Caribbean Sea and the Isthmus transit of
                    commerce. It possesses the richest soil, best and most capacious harbors, most
                    salubrious climate, and the most valuable products of the forest, mine, and soil
                    of any of the West India Islands. Its possession by us will in a few years build
                    up a coastwise commerce of immense magnitude, which will go far toward restoring
                    to us our <pb n="7" xml:id="pg_7" facs="0041"/>lost merchant marine. It will
                    give to us those articles which we consume so largely and do not produce, thus
                    equalizing our exports and imports. In case of foreign war it will give us
                    command of all the islands referred to, and thus prevent an enemy from ever
                    again possessing himself of rendezvous upon our very coast. At present our coast
                    trade between the States bordering on the Atlantic and those bordering on the
                    Gulf of Mexico is cut into by the Bahamas and the Antilles. Twice we must, as it
                    were, pass through foreign countries to get, by sea, from Georgia to the west
                    coast of Florida.</p>
                <p>San Domingo with a stable government, under which her immense resources can be
                    developed, will give remunerative wages to tens of thousands of laborers not now
                    upon the island. This labor will take advantage of every available means of
                    transportation to abandon the adjacent islands and seek the blessings of freedom
                    and its sequence—each inhabitant receiving the reward of his own labor. Porto
                    Rico and Cuba will have to abolish slavery, as a measure of self-preservation,
                    to retain their laborers.</p>
                <p>San Domingo will become a large consumer of the products of Northern farms and
                    manufactories. The cheap rate at which her citizens can be furnished with food,
                    tools, and machinery will make it necessary that contiguous islands should have
                    the same advantages, in order to compete in the production of sugar, coffee,
                    tobacco, tropical fruits, &amp;c. This will open to us a still wider market for
                    our products. The production of our own supply of these articles will cut off
                    more than one hundred millions of our annual imports, besides largely increasing
                    our exports. With such a picture it is easy to see how our large debt abroad is
                    ultimately to be extinguished. With a balance of trade against us (including
                    interest on bonds held by foreigners and money spent by our citizens traveling
                    in foreign lands) equal to the entire yield of the precious metals in this
                    country it is not so easy to see how this result is to be otherwise
                    accomplished.</p>
                <p>The acquisition of San Domingo is an adherence to the “Monroe doctrine;” it is a
                    measure of national protection; it is asserting our just claim to a controlling
                    influence over the great commercial traffic soon to flow from west to east, by
                    way of the Isthmus of Darien; it is to build up our merchant marine; it is to
                    furnish new markets for the products of our farms, shops, and manufactories; it
                    is to make slavery insupportable in Cuba and Porto Rico at once, and ultimately
                    so in Brazil; it is to settle the unhappy condition of Cuba and end an
                    exterminating conflict; it is to provide honest means of paying our honest debts
                    without overtaxing the people; it is to furnish our citizens with the
                    necessaries of every-day life at cheaper rates than ever before; and it is, in
                    fine, a rapid stride toward that greatness which the intelligence, industry, and
                    enterprise of the citizens of the United States entitle this country to assume
                    among nations.</p>
                <p>In view of the importance of this question I earnestly urge upon Congress <pb
                        n="8" xml:id="pg_8" facs="0042"/>early action, expressive of its views as to
                    the best means of acquiring San Domingo. My suggestion is that, by joint
                    resolution of the two houses of Congress, the Executive be authorized to appoint
                    a commission to negotiate a treaty with the authorities of San Domingo for the
                    acquisition of that island, and that an appropriation be made to defray the
                    expenses of such commission. The question may then be determined, either by the
                    action of the Senate upon the treaty or the joint action of the two houses of
                    Congress, upon a resolution of annexation, as in the case of the acquisition of
                    Texas. So convinced am I of the advantages to flow from the acquisition of San
                    Domingo, and of the great disadvantages, I might almost say calamities, to flow
                    from non-acquisition, that I believe the subject has only to be investigated to
                    be approved.</p>
                <p>It is to be regretted that our representations in regard to the injurious
                    effects, especially upon the revenue of the United States, of the policy of the
                    Mexican government, in exempting from impost duties a large tract of its
                    territory on our borders, have not only been fruitless, but that it is even
                    proposed, in that country, to extend the limits within which the privilege
                    adverted to has hitherto been enjoyed. The expediency of taking into your
                    serious consideration proper measures for countervailing the policy referred to
                    will, it is presumed, engage your earnest attention.</p>
                <p>It is the obvious interest, especially of neighboring nations, to provide against
                    impunity to those who may have committed high crimes within their borders, and
                    who may have sought refuge abroad. For this purpose extradition treaties have
                    been concluded with several of the Central American republics, and others are in
                    progress.</p>
                <p>The sense of Congress is desired, as early as may be convenient, upon the
                    proceedings of the commission on claims against Venezuela, as communicated in my
                    messages of March 16, 1869, March 1, 1870, and March 31, 1870. It has not been
                    deemed advisable to distribute any of the money which has been received from
                    that government until Congress shall have acted on the subject.</p>
                <p>The massacres of French and Russian residents at Tien-Tsin, under circumstances
                    of great barbarity, were supposed by some to have been premeditated, and to
                    indicate a purpose among the populace to exterminate foreigners in the Chinese
                    Empire. The evidence fails to establish such a supposition, but shows a
                    complicity between the local authorities and the mob. The government at Pekin,
                    however, seems to have been disposed to fulfill its treaty obligations so far as
                    it was able to do so. Unfortunately, the news of the war between the German
                    states and France reached China soon after the massacre. It would appear that
                    the popular mind became possessed with the idea that this contest, extending to
                    Chinese waters, would neutralize the Christian influence and power, and that the
                    time was coming when the superstitious masses might expel all foreigners and
                    restore mandarin influence. Anticipating <pb n="9" xml:id="pg_9" facs="0043"
                    />trouble from this cause I invited France and North Germany to make an
                    authorized suspension of hostilities in the East, (where they were temporarily
                    suspended by act of the commanders,) and to act together for the future
                    protection, in China, of the lives and properties of Americans and
                    Europeans.</p>
                <p>Since the adjournment of Congress the ratifications of the treaty with Great
                    Britain, for abolishing the mixed courts for the suppression of the slave trade,
                    have been exchanged. It is believed that the slave trade is now confined to the
                    eastern coast of Africa, whence the slaves are taken to Arabian markets.</p>
                <p>The ratifications of the naturalization convention between Great Britain and the
                    United States have also been exchanged during the recess; and thus, a long
                    standing dispute between the two governments has been settled, in accordance
                    with the principles always contended for by the United States.</p>
                <p>In April last, while engaged in locating a military reservation near Pembina, a
                    corps of engineers discovered that the commonly-received boundary line between
                    the United States and the British possessions at that place, is about
                    forty-seven hundred feet south of the true position of the forty-ninth parallel,
                    and that the line, when run on what is now supposed to be the true position of
                    that parallel, would leave the fort of the Hudson’s Bay Company, at Pembina,
                    within the territory of the United States. This information being communicated
                    to the British government, I was requested to consent, and did consent, that the
                    British occupation of the fort of the Hudson’s Bay Company should continue for
                    the present. I deem it important, however, that this part of the boundary line
                    should be definitely fixed by a joint commission of the two governments, and I
                    submit herewith estimates of the expense of such a commission on the part of the
                    United States, and recommend that an appropriation be made for that purpose. The
                    land boundary has already been fixed and marked from the summit of the Rocky
                    Mountains to the Georgian Bay. It should now be, in like manner, marked from the
                    Lake of the Woods to the summit of the Rocky Mountains.</p>
                <p>I regret to say that no conclusion has been reached for the adjustment of the
                    claims against Great Britain, growing out of the course adopted by that
                    government during the rebellion. The cabinet of London, so far as its views have
                    been expressed, does not appear to be willing to concede that her Majesty’s
                    government was guilty of any negligence, or did or permitted any act during the
                    war, by which the United States has just cause of complaint. Our firm and
                    unalterable convictions are directly the reverse. I therefore recommend to
                    Congress to authorize the appointment of a commission to take proof of the
                    amounts, and the ownership of these several claims, on notice to the
                    representative of her Majesty at Washington, and that authority be given for the
                    settlement of these claims by the United States, so that the Government shall
                    have the ownership of the private claims, as well as the responsible control <pb
                        n="10" xml:id="pg_10" facs="0044"/>of all the demands against Great Britain.
                    It cannot be necessary to add that, whenever her Majesty’s government shall
                    entertain a desire for a full and friendly adjustment of these claims, the
                    United States will enter upon their consideration with an earnest desire for a
                    conclusion consistent with the honor and dignity of both nations.</p>
                <p>The course pursued by the Canadian authorities toward the fishermen of the United
                    States during the past season has not been marked by a friendly feeling. By the
                    first article of the convention of 1818, between Great Britain and the United
                    States, it was agreed that the inhabitants of the United States should have
                    forever, in common with British subjects, the right of taking fish in certain
                    waters therein defined. In the waters not included in the limits named in the
                    convention (within three miles of parts of the British coast) it has been the
                    custom for many years to give to intruding fishermen of the United States a
                    reasonable warning of their violation of the technical rights of Great Britain.
                    The imperial government is understood to have delegated the whole or a share of
                    its jurisdiction or control of these in-shore fishing-grounds to the colonial
                    authority known as the Dominion of Canada, and this semi-independent but
                    irresponsible agent has exercised its delegated powers in an unfriendly way.
                    Vessels have been seized without notice or warning, in violation of the custom
                    previously prevailing, and have been taken into the colonial ports, their
                    voyages broken up, and the vessels condemned. There is reason to believe that
                    this unfriendly and vexatious treatment was designed to bear harshly upon the
                    hardy fishermen of the United States, with a view to political effect upon this
                    Government. The statutes of the Dominion of Canada assume a still broader and
                    more untenable jurisdiction over the vessels of the United States. They
                    authorize officers or persons to bring vessels hovering within three marine
                    miles of any of the coasts, bays, creeks, or harbors of Canada into port, to
                    search the cargo, to examine the master on oath touching the cargo and voyage,
                    and to inflict upon him a heavy pecuniary penalty if true answers are not given;
                    and if such a vessel is found “preparing to fish” within three marine miles of
                    any of such coasts, bays, creeks, or harbors without a license, or after the
                    expiration of the period named in the last license granted to it, they provide
                    that the vessel, with her tackle, &amp;c., shall be forfeited. It is not known
                    that any condemnations have been made under this statute. Should the authorities
                    of Canada attempt to enforce it, it will become my duty to take such steps as
                    maybe necessary to protect the rights of the citizens of the United States.</p>
                <p>It has been claimed by her Majesty’s officers that the fishing vessels of the
                    United States have no right to enter the open ports of the British possessions
                    in North America, except for the purposes of shelter and repairing damages, of
                    purchasing wood, and obtaining water; that they have no right to enter at the
                    British custom-houses or to trade there except in the purchase of wood and
                    water; and that they must depart <pb n="11" xml:id="pg_11" facs="0045"/>within
                    twenty-four hours after notice to leave. It is not known that any seizure of a
                    fishing vessel, carrying the flag of the United States, has been made under this
                    claim. So far as the claim is founded on an alleged construction of the
                    convention of 1818, it cannot be acquiesced in by the United States. It is hoped
                    that it will not be insisted on by her Majesty’s government.</p>
                <p>During the conferences which preceded the negotiation of the convention of 1818,
                    the British commissioners proposed to expressly exclude the fishermen of the
                    United States from “the privilege of carrying on trade with any of his Britannic
                    Majesty’s subjects residing within the limits assigned for their use;” and also
                    that it should not be “lawful for the vessels of the United States, engaged in
                    said fishery, to have on board any goods, wares, or merchandise whatever, except
                    such as may be necessary for the prosecution of their voyages to and from the
                    said fishing-grounds. And any vessel of the United States which shall contravene
                    this regulation may be seized, condemned, and confiscated with her cargo.”</p>
                <p>This proposition, which is identical with the construction now put upon the
                    language of the convention, was emphatically rejected by the American
                    commissioners, and thereupon was abandoned by the British plenipotentiaries, and
                    Article I, as it stands in the convention, was substituted.</p>
                <p>If, however, it be said that this claim is founded on provincial or colonial
                    statutes, and not upon the convention, this Government cannot but regard them as
                    unfriendly, and in contravention of the spirit, if not of the letter, of the
                    treaty, for the faithful execution of which the imperial government is alone
                    responsible.</p>
                <p>Anticipating that an attempt may possibly be made by the Canadian authorities in
                    the coming season to repeat their unneighborly acts toward our fishermen, I
                    recommend you to confer upon the Executive the power to suspend, by
                    proclamation, the operation of the laws authorizing the transit of goods, wares,
                    and merchandise in bond across the territory of the United States to Canada; and
                    further, should such an extreme measure become necessary, to suspend the
                    operation of any laws whereby the vessels of the Dominion of Canada are
                    permitted to enter the waters of the United States.</p>
                <p>A like unfriendly disposition has been manifested on the part of Canada in the
                    maintenance of a claim of right to exclude the citizens of the United States
                    from the navigation of the St. Lawrence. This river constitutes a natural outlet
                    to the ocean for eight States with an aggre gate population of about seventeen
                    million six hundred thousand inhabitants, and with an aggregate tonnage of six
                    hundred and sixty-one thousand three hundred and sixty-seven tons upon the
                    waters which discharge into it. The foreign commerce of our ports on these
                    waters is open to British competition, and the major part of it is done in
                    British bottoms.</p>
                <pb n="12" xml:id="pg_12" facs="0046"/>
                <p>If the American seamen be excluded from this natural avenue to the ocean, the
                    monopoly of the direct commerce of the lake ports with the Atlantic would be in
                    foreign hands; their vessels on transatlantic voyages having an access to our
                    lake ports which would be denied to American vessels on similar voyages. To
                    state such a proposition is to refute its justice.</p>
                <p>During the administration of Mr. John Quincy Adams, Mr. Clay unanswerably
                    demonstrated the natural right of the citizens of the United States to the
                    navigation of this river, claiming that the act of the congress of Vienna, in
                    opening the Rhine and other rivers to all nations, showed the judgment of
                    European jurists and statesmen that the inhabitants of a country through which a
                    navigable river passes have a natural right to enjoy the navigation of that
                    river to and into the sea, even though passing through the territories of
                    another power. This right does not exclude the co-equal right of the sovereign
                    possessing the territory through which the river debouches into the sea to make
                    such regulations relative to the police of the navigation as may be reasonably
                    necessary; but those regulations should be framed in a liberal spirit of comity,
                    and should not impose needless burdens upon the commerce which has the right of
                    transit. It has been found in practice more advantageous to arrange these
                    regulations by mutual agreement. The United States are ready to make any
                    reasonable arrangement, as to the police of the St. Lawrence, which may be
                    suggested by Great Britain.</p>
                <p>If the claim made by Mr. Clay was just when the population of States bordering on
                    the shores of the lakes was only three million four hundred thousand, it now
                    derives greater force and equity from the increased population, wealth,
                    production, and tonnage of the States on the Canadian frontier. Since Mr. Clay
                    advanced his argument in behalf of our right the principle for which he
                    contended has been frequently, and by various nations, recognized by law or by
                    treaty, and has been extended to several other great rivers. By the treaty
                    concluded at Mayence, in 1831, the Rhine was declared free from the point where
                    it is first navigable into the sea. By the convention between Spain and
                    Portugal, concluded in 1835, the navigation of the Douro, throughout its whole
                    extent, was made free for the subjects of both crowns. In 1853 the Argentine
                    Confederation by treaty threw open the free navigation of the Parana and the
                    Uruguay to the merchant vessels of all nations. In 1856 the Crimean war was
                    closed by a treaty which provided for the free navigation of the Danube. In 1858
                    Bolivia by treaty, declared that it regarded the rivers Amazon and La Plata, in
                    accordance with fixed principles of national law, as highways or channels,
                    opened by nature, for the commerce of all nations. In 1859 the Paraguay was made
                    free by treaty, and in December 1866 the Emperor of Brazil, by imperial decree,
                    declared the Amazon to be open, to the frontier of Brazil, to the merchant ships
                    of all nations. The greatest <pb n="13" xml:id="pg_13" facs="0047"/>living
                    British authority on this subject, while asserting the abstract right of the
                    British claim, says: “It seems difficult to deny that Great Britain may ground
                    her refusal upon strict <hi rend="italic">law,</hi> but it is equally difficult
                    to deny, first, that in so doing she exercises harshly an extreme and hard law;
                    secondly, that her conduct with respect to the navigation of the St. Lawrence is
                    in glaring and discreditable inconsistency with her conduct with respect to the
                    navigation of the Mississippi. On the ground that she possessed a small domain,
                    in which the Mississippi took its rise, she insisted on the right to navigate
                    the entire volume of its waters. On the ground that she possesses both banks of
                    the St. Lawrence, where it disembogues itself into the sea, she denies to the
                    United States the right of navigation, though about one-half of the waters of
                    Lakes Ontario, Erie, Huron, and Superior, and the whole of Lake Michigan,
                    through which the river flows, are the property of the United States.”</p>
                <p>The whole nation is interested in securing cheap transportation from the
                    agricultural States of the West to the Atlantic seaboard. To the citizens of
                    those States it secures a greater return for their labor; to the inhabitants of
                    the seaboard it affords cheaper food; to the nation, an increase in the annual
                    surplus of wealth. It is hoped that the government of Great Britain will see the
                    justice of abandoning the narrow and inconsistent claim to which her Canadian
                    provinces have urged her adherence.</p>
                <p>Our depressed commerce is a subject to which I called your special attention at
                    the last session, and suggested that we will in the future have to look more to
                    the countries south of us, and to China and Japan, for its revival. Our
                    representatives to all these governments have exerted their influence to
                    encourage trade between the United States and the countries to which they are
                    accredited. But the fact exists that the carrying is done almost entirely in
                    foreign bottoms, and while this state of affairs exists we cannot control our
                    due share of the commerce of the world. That between the Pacific States and
                    China and Japan is about all the carrying trade now conducted in American
                    vessels. I would recommend a liberal policy toward that line of American
                    steamers, one that will insure its success and even increased usefulness.</p>
                <p>The cost of building iron vessels, the only ones that can compete with foreign
                    ships in the carrying trade, is so much greater in the United States than in
                    foreign countries that, without some assistance from the Government, they cannot
                    be successfully built here. There will be several propositions laid before
                    Congress in the course of the present session looking to a remedy for this evil.
                    Even if it should be at some cost to the National Treasury, I hope such
                    encouragement will be given as will secure American shipping on the high seas
                    and American ship-building at home.</p>
                <p>The condition of the archives at the Department of State calls for the early
                    action of Congress. The building now rented by that Department <pb n="14"
                        xml:id="pg_14" facs="0048"/>is a frail structure, at an inconvenient
                    distance from the Executive Mansion and from the other Departments, is ill
                    adapted to the purpose for which it is used, has not capacity to accommodate the
                    archives, and is not fire-proof. Its remote situation, its slender construction,
                    and the absence of a supply of water in the neighborhood, leave but little hope
                    of safety for either the building or its contents in case of the accident of a
                    fire. Its destruction would involve the loss of the rolls containing the
                    original acts and resolutions of Congress, of the historic records of the
                    Revolution and of the Confederation, of the whole series of diplomatic and
                    consular archives since the adoption of the Constitution, and of the many other
                    valuable records and papers left with that Department when it was the principal
                    depository of the governmental archives. I recommend an appropriation for the
                    construction of a building for the Department of State.</p>
                <p>I recommend to your consideration the propriety of transferring to the Department
                    of the Interior, to which they seem more appropriately to belong, all powers and
                    duties in relation to the Territories, with which the Department of State is now
                    charged by law or usage; and from the Interior Department to the War Department
                    the Pension Bureau, so far as it regulates the payment of soldiers’ pensions. I
                    would further recommend that the payment of naval pensions be transferred to one
                    of the Bureaus of the Navy Department.</p>
                <p>The estimates for the expenses of the Government for the next fiscal year are
                    eighteen million two hundred and forty-four thousand three hundred and forty-six
                    dollars and one cent less than for the current one, but exceed the
                    appropriations for the present year, for the same items, eight million nine
                    hundred and seventy-two thousand one hundred and twenty-seven dollars and
                    fifty-six cents. In this estimate, however, is included twenty-two million three
                    hundred and thirty-eight thousand two hundred and seventy-eight dollars and
                    thirty-seven cents for public works heretofore begun under congressional
                    provision, and of which only so much is asked as Congress may choose to give.
                    The appropriation for the same works for the present fiscal year was eleven
                    million nine hundred and eighty-four thousand five hundred and eighteen dollars
                    and eight cents.</p>
                <p>The average value of gold as compared with national currency, for the whole of
                    the year 1869, was about one hundred and thirty-four, and for eleven months of
                    1870 the same relative value has been about one hundred and fifteen. The
                    approach to a specie basis is very gratifying, but the fact cannot be denied
                    that the instability of the value of our currency is prejudicial to our
                    prosperity, and tends to keep up prices to the detriment of trade. The evils of
                    a depreciated and fluctuating currency are so great that now, when the premium
                    on gold has fallen so much, it would seem that the time has arrived when, by
                    wise and prudent legislation, Congress should look to a policy which would place
                    our currency at par with gold at no distant day.</p>
                <pb n="15" xml:id="pg_15" facs="0049"/>
                <p>The tax collected from the people has been reduced more than eighty millions of
                    dollars per annum. By steadiness in our present course, there is no reason why,
                    in a few short years, the national tax-gatherer may not disappear from the door
                    of the citizen almost entirely. With the revenue stamp dispensed by postmasters
                    in every community; a tax upon liquors of all sorts, and tobacco in all its
                    forms; and by a wise adjustment of the tariff, which will put a duty only upon
                    those articles which we could dispense with, known as luxuries, and on those
                    which we use more of than we produce, revenue enough may be raised, after a few
                    years of peace and consequent reduction of indebtedness, to fulfill all our
                    obligations. A further reduction of expenses, in addition to a reduction of
                    interest account, may be relied on to make this practicable. Revenue reform, if
                    it means this, has my hearty support. If it implies a collection of all the
                    revenue for the support of Government, for the payment of principal and interest
                    of the public debt, pensions, &amp;c., by directly taxing the people, then I am
                    against revenue reform, and confidently believe the people are with me. If it
                    means failure to provide the necessary means to defray all the expenses of
                    Government, and thereby repudiation of the public debt and pensions, then I am
                    still more opposed to such kind of revenue reform. Revenue reform, has not been
                    defined by any of its advocates, to my knowledge; but seems to be accepted as
                    something which is to supply every man’s wants without any cost or effort on his
                    part.</p>
                <p>A true revenue reform cannot be made in a day, but must be the work of national
                    legislation and of time. As soon as the revenue can be dispensed with, all duty
                    should be removed from coffee, tea, and other articles of universal use not
                    produced by ourselves. The necessities of the country compel us to collect
                    revenue from our imports. An army of assessors and collectors is not a pleasant
                    sight to the citizen, but that or a tariff for revenue is necessary. Such a
                    tariff, so far as it acts as an encouragement to home production, affords
                    employment to labor at living wages, in contrast to the pauper labor of the Old
                    World, and also in the development of home resources.</p>
                <p>Under the act of Congress of the 15th day of July, 1870, the Army has gradually
                    been reduced, so that, on the 1st day of January, 1871, the number of
                    commissioned officers and men will not exceed the number contemplated by that
                    law.</p>
                <p>The War Department building is an old structure, not fire-proof, and entirely
                    inadequate in dimensions to our present wants. Many thousands of dollars are now
                    paid annually for rent of private buildings to accommodate the various Bureaus
                    of the Department. I recommend an appropriation for a new War Department
                    building, suited to the present and growing wants of the nation.</p>
                <p>The report of the Secretary of War shows a very satisfactory reduction in the
                    expenses of the Army for the last fiscal year. For details you are referred to
                    his accompanying report.</p>
                <pb n="16" xml:id="pg_16" facs="0050"/>
                <p>The expenses of the Navy for the whole of the last year<hi rend="italic">—i.
                        e</hi>., from December 1, 1869, the date of the last report—are less than
                    nineteen million dollars, or about one million dollars less than they were the
                    previous year. The expenses since the commencement of this fiscal year—<hi
                        rend="italic">i. e.</hi>, since July 1—show for the five months a decrease
                    of over two million four hundred thousand dollars from those of the
                    corresponding months of last year. The estimates for the current year were
                    twenty-eight million two hundred and five thousand six hundred and seventy-one
                    dollars and thirty-seven cents. Those for next year are twenty million six
                    hundred and eighty-three thousand three hundred and seventeen dollars, with nine
                    hundred and fifty-five thousand one hundred dollars additional for necessary
                    permanent improvements. These estimates are made closely for the mere
                    maintenance of the naval establishment as it now is, without much in the nature
                    of permanent improvement. The appropriations made for the last and current years
                    were evidently intended by Congress, and are sufficient only, to keep the Navy
                    on its present footing by the repairing and refitting of our old ships.</p>
                <p>This policy must, of course, gradually but surely destroy the Navy, and it is in
                    itself far from economical, as each year that it is pursued the necessity for
                    mere repairs in ships and navy yards becomes more imperative and more costly;
                    and our current expenses are annually increased for the mere repair of ships,
                    many of which must soon become unsafe and useless. I hope during the present
                    session of Congress to be able to submit to it a plan by which naval vessels can
                    be built and repairs made with great saving upon the present cost.</p>
                <p>It can hardly be wise statesmanship in a government which represents a country
                    with over five thousand miles of coast line on both oceans, exclusive of Alaska,
                    and containing forty millions of progressive people, with relations of every
                    nature with almost every foreign country, to rest with such inadequate means of
                    enforcing any foreign policy, either of protection or redress. Separated by the
                    ocean from the nations of the Eastern Continent our Navy is our only means of
                    direct protection to our citizens abroad, or for the enforcement of any foreign
                    policy.</p>
                <p>The accompanying report of the Postmaster General shows a most satisfactory
                    working of that Department. With the adoption of the recommendations contained
                    therein, particularly those relating to a reform in the franking privilege, and
                    the adoption of the “correspondence cards,” a self-sustaining postal system may
                    speedily be looked for, and, at no distant day, a further reduction of the rate
                    of postage be attained.</p>
                <p>I recommend authorization by Congress to the Postmaster General and Attorney
                    General to issue all commissions to officials appointed through their respective
                    Departments. At present these commissions, where appointments are presidential,
                    are issued by the State Department. The law, in all the Departments of
                    Government except those of <pb n="17" xml:id="pg_17" facs="0051"/>the Post
                    Office and of Justice, authorizes each to issue its own commissions.</p>
                <p>Always favoring practical reforms, I respectfully call your attention to one
                    abuse of long standing, which I would like to see remedied by this Congress. It
                    is a reform in the civil service of the country. I would have it go beyond the
                    mere fixing of the tenure of office of clerks and employés, who do not require
                    “the advice and consent of the Senate” to make their appointments complete. I
                    would have it govern, not the tenure, but the manner of making all appointments.
                    There is no duty which so much embarrasses the Executive and Heads of
                    Departments as that of appointments; nor is there any such arduous and thankless
                    labor imposed on Senators and Representatives as that of finding places for
                    constituents. The present system does not secure the best men, and often not
                    even fit men, for public place. The elevation and purification of the civil
                    service of the Government will be hailed with approval by the whole people of
                    the United States.</p>
                <p>Reform in the management of Indian affairs has received the special attention of
                    the administration from its inauguration to the present day. The experiment of
                    making it a missionary work was tried with a few agencies given to the
                    denomination of Friends, and has been found to work most advantageously. All
                    agencies and superintendencies not so disposed of were given to officers of the
                    Army. The act of Congress reducing the Army renders Army officers ineligible for
                    civil positions. Indian agencies being civil offices, I determined to give all
                    the agencies to such religious denominations as had heretofore established
                    missionaries among the Indians, and perhaps to some other denominations who
                    would undertake the work on the same terms—<hi rend="italic">i. e</hi>., as a
                    missionary work. The societies selected are allowed to name their own agents,
                    subject to the approval of the Executive, and are expected to watch over them
                    and aid them as missionaries, to christianize and civilize the Indian, and to
                    train him in the arts of peace. The Government watches over the official acts of
                    these agents, and requires of them as strict an accountability as if they were
                    appointed in any other manner. I entertain the confident hope that the policy
                    now pursued will, in a few years, bring all the Indians upon reservations, where
                    they will live in houses, have school-houses and churches, and will be pursuing
                    peaceful and self-sustaining avocations, and where they may be visited by the
                    law-abiding white man with the same impunity that he now visits the civilized
                    white settlements. I call your special attention to the report of the
                    Commissioner of Indian Affairs for full information on this subject.</p>
                <p>During the last fiscal year eight million ninety-five thousand four hundred and
                    thirteen acres of public land were disposed of. Of this quantity three million
                    six hundred and ninety-eight thousand nine hundred and ten and five
                    one-hundredths acres were taken under the homestead law, and two million one
                    hundred and fifty-nine thousand <pb n="18" xml:id="pg_18" facs="0052"/>five
                    hundred and fifteen and eighty-one one-hundredths acres sold for cash. The
                    remainder was located with military warrants, college or Indian scrip, or
                    applied in satisfaction of grants to railroads, or for other public uses. The
                    entries under the homestead law during the last year covered nine hundred and
                    sixty-one thousand five hundred and forty-five acres more than those during the
                    preceding year. Surveys have been vigorously prosecuted to the full extent of
                    the means applicable to the purpose. The quantity of land in market will amply
                    supply the present demand. The claim of the settler, under the home stead or the
                    pre?mption laws, is not, however, limited to lands subject to sale at private
                    entry. Any unappropriated surveyed public land may, to a limited amount, be
                    acquired under the former laws if the party entitled to enter under them will
                    comply with the requirements they prescribe in regard to the residence and
                    cultivation. The actual settler’s preference right of purchase is even broader,
                    and extends to lands which were unsurveyed at the time of his settlement. His
                    right was formerly confined within much narrower limits, and at one period of
                    our history was conferred only by special statutes. They were enacted from time
                    to time to legalize what was then regarded as an unauthorized intrusion upon the
                    national domain. The opinion that the public lands should be regarded chiefly as
                    a source of revenue is no longer maintained. The rapid settlement and successful
                    cultivation of them are now justly considered of more importance to our
                    well-being than is the fund which the sale of them would produce. The remarkable
                    growth and prosperity of our new States and Territories attest the wisdom of the
                    legislation which invites the tiller of the soil to secure a permanent home on
                    terms within the reach of all. The pioneer who incurs the dangers and privations
                    of a frontier life, and thus aids in laying the foundation of new commonwealths,
                    renders a signal service to his country, and is entitled to its special favor
                    and protection. These laws secure that object and largely promote the general
                    welfare. They should, therefore, be cherished as a permanent feature of our land
                    system.</p>
                <p>Good faith requires us to give full effect to existing grants. The time-honored
                    and beneficent policy of setting apart certain sections of public land for
                    educational purposes in the new States should be continued. When ample provision
                    shall have been made for these objects, I submit as a question worthy of serious
                    consideration, whether the residue of our national domain should not be wholly
                    disposed of under the provisions of the homestead and pre?mption laws.</p>
                <p>In addition to the swamp and overflowed lands granted to the States in which they
                    are situated, the lands taken under the agricultural college acts, and for
                    internal improvement purposes, under the act of September 1841, and the acts
                    supplemental thereto, there had been conveyed up to the close of the last fiscal
                    year, by patent or other equivalent title to States and corporations
                    twenty-seven million eight hundred <pb n="19" xml:id="pg_19" facs="0053"/>and
                    thirty-six thousand two hundred and fifty-seven and sixty-three one-hundredths
                    acres for railways, canals, and wagon roads. It is estimated that an additional
                    quantity of one hundred and seventy-four million seven hundred and thirty-five
                    thousand five hundred and twenty-three acres is still due under grants for like
                    uses. The policy of thus aiding the States in building works of internal
                    improvement was inaugurated more than forty years since in the grants to Indiana
                    and Illinois, to aid those States in opening canals to connect the waters of the
                    Wabash with those of Lake Erie, and the waters of the Illinois with those of
                    Lake Michigan. It was followed, with some modifications, in the grant to
                    Illinois of alternate sections of public land within certain limits of the
                    Illinois Central Railway. Fourteen States and sundry corporations have received
                    similar subsidies in connection with railways completed or in process of
                    construction. As the reserved sections are rated at the double minimum, the sale
                    of them at the enhanced price has thus, in many instances, indemnified the
                    Treasury for the granted lands. The construction of some of these thoroughfares
                    has undoubtedly given a vigorous impulse to the development of our resources and
                    the settlement of the more distant portions of the country. It may, however, be
                    well insisted that much of our legislation in this regard has been characterized
                    by indiscriminate and profuse liberality. The United States should not loan
                    their credit in aid of any enterprise undertaken by States or corporations, nor
                    grant lands in any instance, unless the projected work is of acknowledged
                    national importance. I am strongly inclined to the opinion that it is
                    inexpedient and unnecessary to bestow subsidies of either description; but
                    should Congress determine otherwise, I earnestly recommend that the rights of
                    settlers and of the public be more effectually secured and protected by
                    appropriate legislation.</p>
                <p>During the year ending September 30, 1870, there were filed in the Patent Office
                    nineteen thousand four hundred and eleven applications for patents, three
                    thousand three hundred and seventy-four caveats, and one hundred and sixty
                    applications for the extension of patents. Thirteen thousand six hundred and
                    twenty-two patents, including reissues and designs, were issued; one thousand
                    and ten extended; and one thousand and eighty-nine allowed, but not issued, by
                    reason of the non-payment of the final fees. The receipts of the office during
                    the fiscal year were one hundred and thirty-six thousand three hundred and four
                    dollars and twenty-nine cents in excess of its expenditures.</p>
                <p>The work of the Census Bureau has been energetically prosecuted. The preliminary
                    report, containing much information of special value and interest, will be ready
                    for delivery during the present session. The remaining volumes will be completed
                    with all the dispatch consistent with perfect accuracy in arranging and
                    classifying the returns. We shall thus, at no distant day, be furnished with an
                    authentic record of our condition and resources. It will, I doubt not, attest
                    the growing prosperity of the country although during the decade which has just
                        <pb n="20" xml:id="pg_20" facs="0054"/>closed, it was so severely tried by
                    the great war waged to maintain its integrity, and to secure and perpetuate our
                    free institutions.</p>
                <p>During the last fiscal year the sum paid to pensioners, including the cost of
                    disbursement, was twenty-seven million seven hundred and eighty thousand eight
                    hundred and eleven dollars and eleven cents, and one thousand seven hundred and
                    fifty-eight bounty land warrants were issued. At its close one hundred and
                    ninety-eight thousand six hundred and eighty-six names were on the pension
                    rolls.</p>
                <p>The labors of the Pension Office have been directed to the severe scrutiny of the
                    evidence submitted in favor of new claims, and to the discovery of fictitious
                    claims which have been heretofore allowed. The appropriation for the employment
                    of special agents for the investigation of frauds has been judiciously used, and
                    the results obtained have been of unquestionable benefit to the service.</p>
                <p>The subjects of education and agriculture are of great interest to the success of
                    our republican institutions, happiness, and grandeur as a nation. In the
                    interest of one a Bureau has been established in the Interior Department—the
                    Bureau of Education; and in the interest of the other, a separate Department,
                    that of Agriculture. I believe great general good is to flow from the operations
                    of both these Bureaus if properly fostered. I cannot commend to your careful
                    consideration too highly the reports of the Commissioners of Education and of
                    Agriculture, nor urge too strongly such liberal legislation as to secure their
                    efficiency.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, I would sum up the policy of the administration to be a thorough
                    enforcement of every law; a faithful collection of every tax provided for;
                    economy in the disbursement of the same; a prompt payment of every debt of the
                    nation; a reduction of taxes as rapidly as the requirements of the country will
                    admit; reductions of taxation and tariff, to be so arranged as to afford the
                    greatest relief to the greatest number; honest and fair dealings with all other
                    peoples, to the end that war, with all its blighting consequences, may be
                    avoided, but without surrendering any right or obligation due to us; a reform in
                    the treatment of Indians, and in the whole civil service of the country; and,
                    finally, in securing a pure, untrammeled ballot, where every man entitled to
                    cast a vote may do so, just once, at each election, without fear of molestation
                    or proscription on account of his political faith, nativity, or color.</p>

                            the United States shall then be at peace with such belligerent.)</p>
                        <p>8. Fitting out and arming, or attempt to fit out and arm, or procuring to
                            be fitted out and armed, or knowingly being concerned in the furnishing,

                            armed vessel in the service of either of the said belligerents, or
                            belonging to the subjects or citizens of either, by adding to the number
                            of guns of such vessels, or by changing those on board of her for guns
                            of a larger caliber, or by the addition thereto of any equipment solely
                            applicable to war.</p>
                        <p>11. Beginning or setting on foot or providing or preparing the means for

                            D. 1828, between the same parties, and is still in force, it was agreed
                            that “the vessels of war, public and private, of both parties, shall
                            carry freely, wheresoever they please, the vessels and effects taken
                            from their enemies, without being obliged to pay any duties, charges, or

                            such prizes be arrested, searched, or put under any legal process, when
                            they come to and enter the ports of the other party, but may freely be
                            carried out again at any time by their captors to the places expressed
                            in their commissions, which the commanding officer of such vessel shall
                            be obliged to show.”</p>
                        <p>And I do further declare and proclaim that it has been officially

                            communicated to the Government of the United States by the envoy
                            extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of his Majesty the Emperor of
                            the French, at Washington, that orders have been given that, in the
                            conduct of the war, the commanders of the French forces on land and on
                                <pb n="47" xml:id="pg_47" facs="0081"/>the seas shall scrupulously
                            observe toward neutral powers the rules of international law, and that
                            they shall strictly adhere to the principles set forth in the
                            declaration of the Congress of Paris of the 16th of April, 1856, that is
                            to say: 1st. That privateering is and remains abolished. 2d. That the
                            neutral flag covers enemy’s goods, with the exception of contraband of
                            war. 3d. That neutral goods, with the exception of contraband of war,
                            are not liable to capture under the enemy’s flag. 4th. That blockades,
                            in order to be binding, must be effective, that is to say, maintained by
                            a force sufficient really to prevent access to the coast of the enemy;
                            and that, although the United States have not adhered to the declaration
                            of 1856, the vessels of his Majesty will not seize enemy’s property
                            found on board of a vessel of the United States, provided that property
                            is not contraband of war.</p>
                        <p>And I do further declare and proclaim that the statutes of the United
                            States and the law of nations alike require that no person within the
                            territory and jurisdiction of the United States shall take part,
                            directly or indirectly, in the said war, but shall remain at peace with
                            each of the said belligerents, and shall maintain a strict and impartial
                            neutrality, and that whatever privileges shall be accorded to one
                            belligerent within the ports of the United States shall be in like
                            manner accorded to the other.</p>
                        <p>And I do hereby enjoin all the good citizens of the United States, and
                            all persons residing or being within the territory or jurisdiction of
                            the United States, to observe the laws thereof, and to commit no act
                            contrary to the provisions of the said statutes, or in violation of the
                            law of nations in that behalf.</p>
                        <p>And I do hereby warn all citizens of the United States, and all persons
                            residing or being within their territory or jurisdiction, that, while
                            the free and full expression of sympathies in public and private is not
                            restricted by the laws of the United States, military forces in aid of
                            either belligerent cannot lawfully be originated or organized within
                            their jurisdiction; and that while all persons may lawfully, and without
                            restriction, by reason of the aforesaid state of war, manufacture and
                            sell within the United States arms and munitions of war, and other
                            articles ordinarily known as “contraband of war,” yet they cannot carry
                            such articles upon the high seas for the use or service of either
                            belligerent, nor can they transport soldiers and officers of either, or
                            attempt to break any blockade which may be lawfully established and
                            maintained during the war, without incurring the risk of hostile
                            capture, and the penalties denounced by the law of nations in that
                            behalf.</p>
                        <p>And I do hereby give notice that all citizens of the United States, and
                            others who may claim the protection of this Government, who may
                            misconduct themselves in the premises, will do so at their peril, and
                            that they can in no wise obtain any protection from the Government of
                            the United States against the consequences of their misconduct.</p>
                        <p>In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the
                            United States to be affixed.</p>

                        <p>Whereas on the 22d day of August, 1870, my proclamation was issued,
                            enjoining neutrality in the present war between France and the North
                            German Confederation and its allies, and declaring, so far as then
                            seemed to be necessary, the respective rights and obligations of the
                            belligerent parties and of the citizens of the United States; and
                            whereas subsequent information gives reason to apprehend that armed
                            cruisers of the belligerents may be tempted to abuse the hospitality
                            accorded to them in the ports, harbors, roadsteads, and other waters of
                            the United States, by making such waters subservient to the purposes of
                            war:</p>
                        <p>Now, therefore, I, Ulysses S. Grant, President of the United States of
                            America, do hereby proclaim and declare that any frequenting and use of
                            the waters within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States by
                            the armed vessels of either belligerent, whether public ships or
                            privateers, for the purpose of preparing for hostile operations, or as
                            posts of observation upon the ships of war or privateers or merchant
                            vessels of the other belligerent lying within or being about to enter
                            the jurisdiction of the United States, must be regarded as unfriendly
                            and offensive, and in violation of that neutrality which it is the
                            determination of this Government to observe; and to the end that the
                            hazard and inconvenience of such apprehended practices may be avoided, I
                            further proclaim and declare that, from and after the 12th day of
                            October instant, and during the continuance of the present hostilities
                            between France and the North German Confederation and its allies, no
                            ship of war or privateer of either belligerent shall be permitted to
                            make use of any port, harbor, roadstead, or other waters within the
                            jurisdiction of the United States as a station or place of resort for
                            any warlike purpose, or for the purpose of obtaining any facilities of
                            warlike equipment; and no ship of war or privateer of either belligerent
                            shall be permitted to sail out of or leave any port, harbor, or
                            roadstead, or waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States
                            from which a vessel of the other belligerent (whether the same shall be
                            a ship of war, a privateer, or a merchant ship) shall have previously
                            departed, until after the expiration of at least twenty-four hours from
                            the departure of such last-mentioned vessel beyond the jurisdiction of
                            the United States. If any ship of war or privateer of either belligerent
                            shall, after the time this notification takes effect, enter any port,
                            harbor, roadstead, or waters of the United States, such vessel shall be
                            required to depart and to put to sea within twenty-four hours after her
                            entrance into such port, harbor, roadstead, or waters, except in case of
                            stress of weather or of her requiring provisions or things necessary for
                            the subsistence of her crew, or for repairs; in either of which cases
                            the authorities of the port or of the nearest port (as the case may be)
                            shall require her to put to sea as soon as possible after the expiration
                            of such period of twenty-four hours, without permitting her to take in
                            supplies beyond what may be necessary for her immediate use; and no such
                            vessel which may have been permitted to remain within the waters of the
                            United States for the purpose of repair shall continue within such port,
                            harbor, roadstead, or waters for a longer period than twenty-four hours
                            after her necessary repairs shall have been completed, unless within
                            such twenty-four hours <pb n="49" xml:id="pg_49" facs="0083"/>a vessel,
                            whether ship of war, privateer, or merchant ship of the other
                            belligerent, shall have departed therefrom, in which case the time
                            limited for the departure of such ship of war or privateer shall be
                            extended so far as may be necessary to secure an interval of not less
                            than twenty-four hours between such departure and that of any ship of
                            war, privateer, or merchant ship of the other belligerent which may have
                            previously quit the same port, harbor, roadstead, or waters. No ship of
                            war or privateer of either belligerent shall be detained in any port,
                            harbor, roadstead, or waters of the United States more than twenty-four
                            hours, by reason of the successive departures from such port, harbor,
                            roadstead, or waters of more than one vessel of the other belligerent.
                            But if there be several vessels of each or either of the two
                            belligerents in the same port, harbor, roadstead, or waters, the order
                            of their departure therefrom shall be so arranged as to afford the
                            opportunity of leaving alternately to the vessels of the respective
                            belligerents, and to cause the least detention consistent with the
                            objects of this proclamation, No ship of war or privateer of either
                            belligerent shall be permitted, while in any port, harbor, roadstead, or
                            waters within the jurisdiction of the United States, to take in any
                            supplies except provisions and such other things as may be requisite for
                            the subsistence of her crew, and except so much coal only as may be
                            sufficient to carry such vessel, if without sail power, to the nearest
                            European port of her own country; or in case the vessel is rigged to go
                            under sail, and may also be propelled by steam power, then with half the
                            quantity of coal which she would be entitled to receive if dependent
                            upon steam alone; and no coal shall be again supplied to any such ship
                            of war or privateer in the same or any other port, harbor, roadstead, or
                            waters of the United States, without special permission, until after the
                            expiration of three months from the time when such coal may have been
                            last supplied to her within the waters of the United States, unless such
                            ship of war or privateer shall, since last thus supplied, have entered a
                            European port of the government to which she belongs.</p>

                        <p>The visit of M. Thiers to this court, on behalf of the government of the
                            national defense at Paris, left behind it no marked impression. He
                            remained but a few hours, and what he said had relation, as the
                            chancellor remarked, rather to the blunders committed by the last
                            dynasty, than to the plans and hopes of that which has succeeded it.</p>
                        <p>He expressed, as I understand, his belief that France was republican in
                            her feelings, and that the national convention when elected would
                            sympathize with the present government at Paris, and he urged the
                            propriety of a recognition of the government of national defense by the
                            powers of Europe. He was answered that this cabinet was inclined to the
                            same view, but that it seemed proper that recognition of the new
                            government by France herself should precede its recognition by foreign
                            governments. He was assured of the continued friendly disposition toward
                            France of the court of Austria, Hungary, and of its readiness in the
                            future, as in the past, to unite in any effort at mediation.</p>

                        <p>The growing importance of American opinion on the continent, of which I
                            have frequently spoken, is shown in the efforts made by the German press
                            to deprive American recognition of the republic of all moral power by
                            intimations that the Government at Washington were deluded into the step
                            by the deceptive representation of their envoy at Paris.</p>
                        <p>A dispatch, of course fictitious, intended to produce this impression, I
                            find in the Vienna press of the 27th of September, as follows:</p>

                        <p>I have a letter from General Sheridan of the 24th August, saying, “I
                            reached this place, (Point-à-Mousson,) the headquarters of the Prussian
                            army, on the 17th, after much delay. On the 18th witnessed the battle of
                            Gravelotte, just west of Metz. The battle was sanguinary, and resulted
                            in favor of the Prussians, who forced the French army back on Metz and
                            cut off all the roads leading to Paris. The loss of the Prussians was
                            very great, perhaps double that of the French, as the latter held a very
                            strong position and defended it with skill and tenacity. A battle took
                            place also on the 16th for the possession of the Verdun road, at a
                            little village called Reazonville, west of Metz, in which the losses
                            were very heavy on both sides, the battle going in favor of the
                            Prussians, and with fearful loss to the French.”</p>
                        <p>There was very hard fighting yesterday and the day before near Beaumont,
                            and McMahon was driven nearly to the Belgian frontier. The greater
                            portion of the Belgian troops are stationed near the southeastern
                            frontier, and there is a good deal of fear that the combatants may cross
                            the line. The government has refused to allow the wounded of either side
                            to pass through Belgium, and ordered that none of the wounded shall be
                            carried on the Belgian railroads.</p>
                        <p>The chambers have done but little, except to vote the money required for
                            war purposes. A proposition favoring a line of steamers between New York
                            and Antwerp has been before the chambers, though I see no disposition on
                            the part, either of the government or private individuals, to furnish
                            any considerable sum of money for the purpose.</p>
                        <p>During the last few days a great many Americans have come to Brussels,
                            mostly from Paris.</p>
                        <p>I can see no reason why the Grown Prince may not reach Paris within a
                            very few days.</p>

                        <p>I have the honor to inform you that the chambers were convened on the
                            21st instant and adjourned yesterday. The only business transacted was
                            the voting of ten millions francs for war purposes. It appears that the
                            former estimate of the minister of war was found insufficient.</p>
                        <p>About one-third of the army has been dismissed and sent home, the
                            supposition being that there will be no use for them.</p>
                        <p>The new French minister, M. Tachard, is here, having been received some
                            five or six days since. There are a great many wounded French officers
                            and soldiers here and throughout Belgium, though very few Germans. They
                            are being carefully cared for, large contributions having been made by
                            the citizens.</p>
                        <p>Communication by mail and telegraph between here and Paris has been
                            suspended for several days. No one here thinks an agreement between
                            Count Bismarck and M. Jules Favre possible.</p>
                        <p>I am credibly informed that the Prussian government is providing winter
                            clothing for its soldiers, and that already some 200,000 fur suits have
                            been prepared at Berlin.</p>
                        <p>General Burnside arrived here last evening and has gone to-day to Sedan.

                        <p>Doctor Evans, an American dentist of Paris, was in to see me two or three
                            days since, and told me that on Sunday p. m., September 4, the Empress,
                            accompanied by a Madame Bretton, left the Tuilleries as the crowd was
                            rushing in, took a little hack they found on the street, and drove to
                            his house, on the avenue de l’Imperatrice, where they remained until
                            five o’clock the next morning, when he took the ladies in his carriage,
                            accompanied by a Dr. Crane, and drove fifty-six miles on their way to
                            Trouville, just south of Havre, passing through Evreux and Lisieux. Near
                            Trouville they took a little sail vessel, of 38 tons, going on board at
                            1 o’clock at night, and crossed over to the Isle of Wight, being twenty
                            hours in crossing, the whole party being literally drenched from the
                            washing of the waves over the little boat. From there they crossed over
                            to Portsmouth, where they took the cars for Hastings, where they found
                            the little Prince. Dr. Evans left the Empress and her son on Saturday
                            last, at Shillingshurst, and was on his way to Wilhelmshoe, to see the
                            Emperor, when I saw him.</p>

                            <p>The following is the text of M. Jules Favre’s circular:</p>
                            <p rend="right"><hi rend="smallcaps">Paris,</hi>
                                <hi rend="italic">November</hi> 7, 1870.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> Prussia has just rejected the
                                armistice proposed by the four great neutral powers—England, Russia,
                                Austria, and Italy—having for its object the convocation of a
                                national assembly. She has thus shown once more that she continued
                                the war with a purely selfish purpose, without preoccupying herself
                                with the true interest of her subjects, and especially that of the
                                Germans, whom she leads on in her train. She pretends, it is true,
                                to be constrained by our refusal to cede to her two of our
                                provinces; but she occupies those provinces, which we neither wish
                                nor are able to give up to her, and whose inhabitants energetically
                                repel her, and it is not for the purpose of obtaining them that she
                                lays waste our fields, drives before her armies our ruined families,
                                and has held, for nearly fifty days, Paris shut in under the fire of
                                the batteries behind which she intrenches herself. No; she wishes to
                                destroy us to satisfy the ambition of the men who govern her. The
                                sacrifice of the French nation is beneficial to the preservation of
                                their power. They accomplish it coldly, being astonished that we are
                                not their accomplices in giving ourselves up to the exhaustions to
                                which their diplomacy advises us.</p>
                            <p>Being engaged in this course, Prussia shuts her ear to the opinion of
                                the world. Knowing that she wounds all honest sensibilities, that
                                she alarms all conservative interests, makes an isolated system and
                                thus shrinks away from the condemnation which Europe would not fail
                                to inflict upon her if it had been allowed to discuss her conduct.
                                And yet, in spite of her refusals, four great neutral powers
                                intervened and proposed to her a suspension of arms, with the
                                definite purpose of permitting France to take the opinion of her
                                people by calling together an assembly. What could be more
                                reasonable, more equitable, more necessary? The imperial government
                                has been overwhelmed by the exertions of Prussia. The following day
                                the men whom necessity had clothed with power proposed a peace to
                                her, and, in order to settle the conditions thereof, demanded a
                                truce, as indispensable to the formation of a national
                                representation.</p>
                            <p>Prussia repelled the idea of a truce by subordinating it to
                                unacceptable exactions, and her armies surrounded Paris. An early
                                surrender had been foretold to her. The siege has lasted fifty days;
                                the people are not growing weaker. The promised sedition was
                                expected for a longtime; it came at a propitious moment for the
                                Prussian negotiator, who announced it to ours as a foreseen
                                auxiliary; but by breaking out, it permitted the people of Paris, by
                                a commanding vote, to legitimatize the government of the national
                                defense, which by this means obtained in the eyes of Europe a
                                consecration of its right.</p>
                            <p>It behooved it then to confer with regard to the proposition for an
                                armistice of the four powers; it could without temerity hope for its
                                success. Being desirous above all to defer to the representatives of
                                the country, and to come to an honorable peace through them, it
                                accepted the negotiation and entered upon it in the ordinary terms
                                of international law.</p>
                            <p>The armistice should admit of the election of deputies throughout the
                                whole territory of the republic, even that which is invaded; a
                                duration of twenty-five days; a revictualing proportional to this
                                duration.</p>
                            <p>Prussia did not contest the two first conditions. However, she made
                                in relation to the vote of Alsace and Lorraine some reservations
                                which we mention without giving them further examination, because
                                her absolute refusal to permit the revictualing has <pb n="54"
                                    xml:id="pg_54" facs="0088"/>rendered all discussion useless. In
                                fact, the revictualing is the necessary consequence of a suspension
                                of arms with regard to an invested city. Provisions are an element
                                of defense. The act of taking them from it without compensation is
                                to create an inequality contrary to justice. Would Prussia dare to
                                ask us to lay low a piece of our walls by means of her cannon,
                                without allowing us to resist her? She would place us in a still
                                worse situation, by compelling us to consume a month without
                                fighting, while, she, living on our soil, would wait till we were
                                harassed by famine to renew the war. Her armistice, without
                                revictualing, would be a capitulation at a specified time without
                                honor and without hope.</p>
                            <p>In refusing the revictualing, Prussia then refuses the armistice. And
                                this time it is not the army only, it is the French nation which she
                                pretends to annihilate by reducing Paris to the terrors of hunger.
                                The question in point is to know whether France can assemble her
                                deputies to deliberate with respect to peace. Europe demands this
                                assembly. Prussia repels it by subjecting it to a condition which is
                                inimical and contrary to common law. And yet, if one must believe a
                                document, published and not contradicted, and which is said to have
                                emanated from her chancellor’s office, she dares to accuse the
                                government of the national defense of giving up Paris to certain
                                famine. She complains of being compelled by it to invest and to
                                starve us.</p>
                            <p>Europe will judge what such imputations are worth. They are the last
                                stroke of that policy which begins by pledging the word of the
                                sovereign in behalf of the French nation, and ends by the systematic
                                rejection of all combinations which allow France to express her
                                will. We do not know what the four great neutral powers, whose
                                propositions are put aside with so much haughtiness, will think;
                                perhaps they finally will conjecture what Prussia, having become by
                                victory mistress able to accomplish all her designs, would lay in
                                store for them.</p>
                            <p>As regards us, we obey an imperious and simple duty in persisting to
                                maintain their proposition of an armistice as the only means of
                                solving, by an assembly, the formidable questions which the crimes
                                of the imperial government have allowed the enemy to impose upon us.
                                Prussia, who feels the odium of her refusal, dissimulates it under a
                                disguise which can deceive no one. She asks us provisions for a
                                month; it is asking us for our arms. We hold them with a resolute
                                hand, and we will not lay them down without fighting. We have done
                                all that men of honor could do to put a stop to the contest. The
                                outlet is closed to us; we have only hereafter to consult our
                                courage in putting back the responsibility of the bloodshed on those
                                who systematically repel every transaction.</p>
                            <p>It is through their personal ambition that thousands of men may yet
                                be sacrificed. And when Europe, aroused, wishes to stop the
                                combatants on the border of this field of carnage, in order to call
                                the representatives of the nation and to attempt peace, “Yes,” they
                                say, “but on the condition that that suffering population—those
                                women, those children, those old men, who are the innocent victims
                                of the war—shall receive no succor; that when the truce shall have
                                expired, it shall be no longer possible for their defenders to fight
                                us without causing them to die of hunger.” That is what the Prussian
                                leaders do not fear to answer to the proposition of the four powers.
                                We call to witness against them right and justice, and we are
                                convinced that if, like ours, their nation and their army could
                                vote, they would condemn this inhuman policy. It would at least be
                                established that, to the last hour, the government of the national
                                defense, preoccupied with the vast and precious interests which are
                                confided to it, has done everything to make possible an honorable
                                peace. They refuse it the means of consulting France. It questions
                                Paris, and the whole of Paris takes up arms to show the country and
                                the world what a great people is able to do when it defends its
                                honor, its fireside, and the independence of the land.</p>

                            <p>The Staatsanzeiger brings us the text of the circular of Count
                                Bismarck, dated November 8, addressed to the representatives of the
                                North German Confederation, and giving an account of the
                                negotiations held at Versailles with M. Thiers. The document is as
                                follows:</p>
                            <p rend="right"><hi rend="smallcaps">“Versailles,</hi>
                                <hi rend="italic">November</hi> 8, 1870.</p>
                            <p>“Your excellency is aware that M. Thiers had expressed a desire to
                                repair to headquarters in order to commence negotiations, after
                                having conferred with the different members of the government of the
                                national defense at Tours and at Paris. By order of his Majesty I
                                declared my readiness to accept these conferences, and M. Thiers was
                                    <pb n="55" xml:id="pg_55" facs="0089"/>yesterday authorized to
                                go to Paris on the 30th of October, whence he returned, on the 31st,
                                to headquarters.</p>
                            <p>“The fact that a statesman so eminent and so experienced as M. Thiers
                                had accepted the powers of the Paris government gave me reason to
                                hope that propositions would be made to us, whose acceptance would
                                be possible, favoring the re?stablishment of peace. I received M.
                                Thiers with very respectful attention, to which his distinguished
                                personal qualities, laying aside the consideration of his former
                                relations, gave him a perfect right. M. Thiers declared that, at the
                                request of the neutral powers, France was ready to conclude an
                                armistice. His Majesty the King, in view of this declaration, had to
                                consider that an armistice, by itself, brought with it, for Germany,
                                all the disadvantages which any prolongation of the campaign must
                                bring to an army whose provisioning is rendered more difficult by
                                the distance from which it is obliged to draw its supplies.
                                Moreover, with the armistice we assumed the obligation of stopping
                                the forces rendered disposable by the capitulation of Metz, in the
                                positions which they should occupy on the day of the signing, and to
                                renounce, in consequence, the occupation of vast hostile territories
                                which we could to-day seize without striking a blow, or in spite of
                                an unimportant resistance. In the space of a few weeks the German
                                armies will not be able to expect any large reënforcements. On the
                                other hand, the armistice would have rendered it possible for France
                                to develop her own resources, to complete the organization of her
                                forces, and, in case of a recommencement of hostilities at the
                                expiration of the armistice, to array large military forces against
                                us which do not now exist.</p>
                            <p>“Notwithstanding these considerations, his Majesty manifested the
                                desire to take the first step in favor of peace, and I was
                                authorized to anticipate the wishes of M. Thiers in granting an
                                armistice of twenty-five days, or even of twenty-eight days, just as
                                he has expressed the desire in the course, upon the base of a simple
                                    military<hi rend="italic"> statu quo</hi>, from the day of the
                                signature. I proposed to him to determine by the line of demarcation
                                the position of the respective troops, such as it would be on the
                                day of the signature, to suspend hostilities during four weeks, and
                                to proceed, during this time, to the election and constitution of a
                                national assembly. For France this armistice would not have had
                                other consequences than to renounce of these little sorties, each
                                time unlucky, and to avoid the unnecessary and incomprehensible
                                waste of her munitions kept for the defense of the fortifications.
                                With regard to the election of Alsace I was unable to declare that
                                we would not insist on any stipulations which may put in question
                                the dependence of the German departments of France, before the
                                conclusion of peace, and that we would not hold any inhabitant of
                                these provinces responsible for having taken their seats in a
                                national assembly as a representant of their countrymen.</p>
                            <p>“I was much astonished on hearing the representative of provisional
                                government decline the propositions, all advantages of which were
                                for the French, and declare himself unable to accept any armistice
                                unless it stipulated for the revictualing of Paris in proportion to
                                its duration. I answered that an article of this nature disagreed
                                infinitely from the military <hi rend="italic">statu quo,</hi> and
                                surpassed greatly all concessions which might reasonably be
                                contended for. I asked him, nevertheless, if he had any equivalent
                                to offer in exchange, and, in this case, what would be this
                                equivalent. M. Thiers declared to me that he was not authorized to
                                offer us in exchange any military concession of any kind whatever,
                                but that he was charged to put this question of revictualing,
                                affirming to us in compensation the good will with which the
                                government would take the test of the reunion of an assembly chosen
                                freely by the French nation and with which it undoubtedly would be
                                possible to open negotiations for peace. These declarations being
                                given it was my duty to refer them to the King and his council of
                                war. His Majesty was rightly very much surprised at demands
                                disagreeing in so unusual a manner from military usages, and
                                deceived in the hope which he had founded on the negotiations with
                                M. Thiers. The scarcely credible pretension, to make us lose the
                                fruits of two months of exertion, with the advantages which they had
                                brought us, and to lead us back to the point where we were at the
                                commencement of the investment of the capital, proved again that
                                they were seeking at Paris merely a pretext to prevent the elections
                                and not an opportunity to let the nation manifest its will without
                                obstacle.</p>
                            <p>“Upon the desire expressed by me to try once more to make an
                                arrangement upon new foundations before recommencing hostilities, M.
                                Thiers had, upon 5th of this month, on the line of our outposts, a
                                last interview with the members of the provisional government, in
                                which he proposed to them either a shorter armistice with the
                                military <hi rend="italic">statu quo,</hi> or the convocation of the
                                electors without special stipulations concerning an armistice, in
                                which ease I was ready to concede all the measures compatible with
                                our military security.</p>
                            <p>“M. Thiers has not made me acquainted with the details of his
                                interview with MM. Trochu and Jules Favre; he could only communicate
                                the result to me, which was the injunction received by him to break
                                off negotiations and to leave Versailles, because they could not
                                result in an armistice with revictualing. His departure for Tours
                                took place on the morning of the 7th. The progress of negotiations
                                    <pb n="56" xml:id="pg_56" facs="0090"/>has convinced me that
                                form the beginning the men who are actually at the head of the
                                French government did not seriously desire to let the voice of the
                                French nation make itself heard in a representative assembly; that
                                they have proposed a condition which they knew to be perfectly
                                unacceptable, only in order not to avoid giving a negative response
                                to the neutral powers from whom they expect support.</p>

                                Mr. Von Thiele, that liberty of relation with Paris existed only so

                            <p>The same day I received, at Ferrières, the communication of the
                                minister of foreign affairs of the government of the national
                                defense, informing me of the desire expressed by the diplomatic
                                corps to send a courier each week with the dispatches for their
                                governments. I did not hesitate, in accordance with the rules
                                established by international law, to give the answer dictated to me
                                by the exigencies of the military situation. It has seemed proper to
                                the men actually in power to establish the seat of their government
                                in the interior of the fortifications of Paris, and to choose this
                                city and its environs for the scene of war. If the members of the
                                diplomatic corps accredited to the preceding government have decided
                                to share, with the government of national defense, in conveniences
                                inseparable from a stay in a besieged fortress, the responsibility
                                for it does not rest with the government of the King.</p>
                            <p>Whatever may be our confidence that the subscribers to the letter of
                                the 6th October will submit personally, in the communications
                                addressed to their governments, to the obligations which their
                                presence in a strongly besieged place may impose on diplomatic
                                agents, in accordance with the rules of war, we must not the less
                                take into consideration the fact that the importance of certain
                                facts in a military point of view might escape them. It is evident,
                                beside, that they could not offer to us the same guarantee for the
                                messengers whom they are to employ, and whom we shall be obliged to
                                allow to pass our lines. A state of things has been produced in
                                Paris no analogous precedent to which is offered by modern history,
                                viewed from the standpoint of international law.</p>
                            <p>A government at war with a power which has not yet recognized it, is
                                shut up in a besieged fortress, and sees itself surrounded by a
                                party of diplomatists, who had been accredited to a government for
                                which the government of the national defense has been substituted.
                                In presence of so irregular a situation, it will be difficult to
                                establish, on the basis of the law of nations, rules which would be
                                incontestable from all points of view.</p>
                            <p>I believe myself entitled to hope that your excellency will
                                comprehend the justice of these observations, and will appreciate
                                the considerations which, to my lively regret, prevent me from
                                giving assent to the desire expressed in your letter of the 6th
                                October. Beside, if the subscribers cannot admit the justice of this
                                denial, the governments which they have represented at Paris, and
                                whom I shall, without delay, make <pb n="57" xml:id="pg_57"

                                between us, will put themselves in communication with the government
                                of the King, in order to examine the questions of the laws of
                                nations, which are attached to the abnormal condition which events
                                and the measures of the government of the national defense have
                                created in Paris.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I herewith inclose the Danish and French
                            texts of the proclamation of neutrality, published by this government
                            yesterday. There seems to be a very general doubt felt and expressed
                            here, as to whether this position can be maintained. The diplomatic
                            opinion is, that decided French pressure upon this government would at
                            once carry it into war, but that, at present, that pressure is not
                            applied, and that, on the contrary, the influence of the cabinets of
                            London and St. Petersburg, necessarily very considerable here, is
                            exercised to keep Denmark neutral.</p>
                        <p>Into any estimate of the probabilities of this government remaining
                            neutral must enter a consideration of the following counter-influences:
                            In proportion as France may succeed in the field, the willingness and
                            the inclination here to engage in the war would be increased; but, at
                            the same time, the desire of Frauce for allies, in such a contingency,
                            might be wholly extinguished, and she might, for many reasons, prefer
                            the advantage, the credit, and the satisfaction of a single-handed
                            success. And in proportion as Prussia may succeed in the field, and as
                            France may, for this reason, be anxious for allies, and seek to drag
                            them into the war, Denmark would, for the same reasons, be more cautious
                            in committing her destiny, for it would be no less, to the doubtful
                            issue of the war.</p>
                        <p>It was stated and extensively believed here, soon after war was declared,
                            that Prussia, with the view of keeping Denmark quiet, had offered to
                            restore entire the Duchy of Schleswig; and more recently it has been
                            stated both here and at Paris that the offers embraced all of the
                            disputed portion, or North Schleswig, excepting the Island of Als and
                            the fortress of Dybböl.</p>
                        <p>I am able to state to you, without qualification, that these reports have
                            no foundation whatever in fact, and that since March 1868, Prussia has
                            not, directly or indirectly, made any proposition, suggestion, or
                            intimation—has not said, or caused to be said, a word to Denmark upon
                            the Schleswig question.</p>

                                suivent:</p>
                            <p>§ 1. D’après la loi du 13 Mars 1867, le passeport royal en langue
                                latine prescrit par <pb n="58" xml:id="pg_58" facs="0092"
                                />l’ordonnance du 4 Mai 1803 n’est plus exigé des navires qui sont
                                munis du certificat de nationalité et d’enregistrement, et quant à
                                ceux qui naviguent encore avec les anciens papiers, la lettre de
                                jauge, conjointement avec les autres documents de légitimation,
                                constitue une preuve suffisante de leur nationalité.</p>
                            <p>§ 2. La règle contenue dans le § 8 de l’ordonnance du 4 Mai 1803, et
                                relative à la nationalité de l’équipage, a été abolie par la loi du
                                23 Janvier 1862 sur l’engagement des marins étrangers à bord des
                                navires danois.</p>
                            <p>§ 3. La déclaration concernant les droits des états neutres en cas de
                                guerre entre puissances maritimes étrangères, qui a été signée à
                                Paris le 16 Avril 1856 par les deux puissances belligérantes, et à
                                laquelle Sa Majesté le Roi a adhéré le 25 Juin de la même année,
                                renferme les dispositions suivantes:</p>
                            <p>1. La course est et demeure abolie;</p>
                            <p>2. Le pavillon neutre couvre la marchandise ennemie, à l’exception de
                                la contrebande de guerre;</p>
                            <p>3. La marchandise neutre, à l’exception de la contrebande de guerre,
                                n’est pas saisissable sous pavillon ennemi; et</p>
                            <p>4. Les blocus, pour être obligatoires, doivent être effectifs,
                                c’est-à-dire maintenus par une force suffisante pour interdire
                                réellement l’accès du littoral de l’ennemi.</p>
                            <p>§ 4. Outre les objets mentionnés dans l’article 13 de l’ordonnance du
                                4 Mai 1803, seront encore considérés comme contrebande de guerre
                                tous les articles manufacturés qui peuvent servir directement à un
                                usage de guerre.</p>
                            <p>Dans le cas où, par suite de conventions particulières conclues entre
                                Sa Majesté le Roi et des puissances étrangères, il deviendrait
                                nécessaire de modifier les dispositions concernant la contrebande de
                                guerre ou d’en prendre de nouvelles, le ministère des affaires
                                étrangères se réserve, après en avoir obtenu l’autorisation de Sa
                                Majesté, de les porter à la connaissance du public.</p>
                            <p>§ 5. Sa Majesté le Roi, ayant l’intention de garder la neutralité
                                pendant la guerre actuelle, il est défendu aux sujets danois de
                                s’engager, en quelque qualité que ce soit, au service des puissances
                                belligérantes, soit dans leurs armées soit dans leurs marines, et
                                plus spécialement d’entreprendre le pilotage des bâtiments de guerre
                                ou de transport de ces puissances en dehors des parages où
                                fonctionnent ordinairement les pilotes danois.</p>
                            <p>Les dispositions qui précèdent sont portées par la présente à la
                                connaissance de tous ceux que cela regarde, pour leur information et
                                pour leur servir de gouverne.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Monsieur</hi>: I have the honor to inform you
                                officially that in response to the notification of the war which has
                                arisen between Prussia and France, my august sovereign the King has
                                caused it to be declared at Berlin, as his Majesty will immediately
                                cause it to be declared at Paris, that he intends to remain neutral
                                in the present conflict. By reason of this determination the
                                minister of foreign affairs has just published an open letter, which
                                enjoins upon Danish subjects the obligations incumbent upon them
                                under the present circumstances. I have already permitted myself to
                                transmit to you several <pb n="59" xml:id="pg_59" facs="0093"

                                pray you, monsieur, to accept the renewed assurance of my most

                                nos ordonnances antérieures. Nous avons néanmoins jugé nécessaire,
                                dans les circonstances actuelles, d’exposer dans une seule
                                ordonnance le contenu de ces règlements, modifié à plusieurs égards,
                                et tel qu’il devra dorénavant servir de règle; afin que par la

                                invariables, d’après lesquels nous entendons maintenir en tout temps

                                semblable. En conséquence c’est notre volonté royale, que le
                                règlement suivant soit dorénavant ponctuellement observé comme la

                                guerre, assure au commerce et à la navigation légitime de nos
                                sujets. A ces causes, révoquant par la présente nos ordonnances
                                antérieures relativement à la conduite de nos dits sujets pendant
                                une guerre maritime étrangère, nous ordonnons et publions ce qui

                                l’équipage. Chaque changement qui y aura lieu, le capitaine sera
                                obligé de le faire insérer, avec explication des causes qui l’ont
                                rendu nécessaire, dans le rôle d’équipage appartenant au navire,
                                lequel rôle sera dûment attesté par le consul ou commissaire de

                                marchandises qui seraient réputées contrebande de guerre, si elles
                                étaient destinées pour les ports d’une puissance belligérante ou
                                qu’elles appartinssent à ses sujets. Nous avons jugé convenable de
                                fixer expressément ce qui devra être compris sous la dénomination de
                                contrebande de guerre, afin de prévenir qu’il ne soit abusé de notre

                                énoncés seront réputés être contrebande de guerre, vis: canons,

                                publiquement autorisée et qualifiée pour cet acte; laquelle

                                retour dans un des ports de nos royaumes. En cas que cette

                                nouvelle ni du navire ni de ces marchandises. Si l’arrivée du navire
                                et le déchargement des marchandises ci-dessus spécifiées dans un
                                port neutre ne peuvent être prouvés, et qu’une prise en mer ou

                                que porte le navire; et seront en outre autant l’armateur que le

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Art.</hi> 15. Il est défendu à tous capitaines
                                de navires, de faire voile pour un port bloqué du côté de la mer par
                                une des puissances en guerre; au contraire, ils devront se conformer
                                strictement aux renseignements, qui leur auront été donnés par les
                                magistrats compétents, relativement au blocus de ce port. En cas
                                qu’un capitaine, voulant entrer dans un port, dont le blocus ne lui
                                aurait point été connu, rencontre quelque vaisseau de haut bord,
                                portant pavillon de quelque puissance en guerre, dont le commandant
                                l’avertisse que ce port est réellement bloqué, il sera obligé de se
                                retirer incessamment, et ne tentera en aucune manière d’y entrer,
                                tant que le blocus n’en sera pas levé.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Art.</hi> 16. Il ne sera permis à aucun de nos

                                d’équipement. Aucun armateur, aucun capitaine, ne doit permettre,
                                qu’il soit fait usage de son navire pour transporter des troupes ou
                                munitions de guerre, de quelle espèce que ce puisse être. Au cas
                                qu’un capitaine ne puisse empêcher, que, pour pareil service, il
                                soit abusé de son navire par une force irresistible, il sera tenû de
                                protester, d’une manière solennelle et par acte authentique, contre
                                la violence qu’il n’a pas été en son pouvoir d’éviter.</p>

                                appartenant à une des puissances belligérantes, et qui serait
                                autorisé à demander l’inspection des papiers de mer à bord des
                                vaisseaux marchands, le capitaine n’opposera aucune resistance à cet
                                examen, si le commandant du bâtiment armé annonce l’intention de le
                                faire; mais il sera au contraire obligé d’exhiber fidèlement et sans
                                dissimulation quelconque, tous les papiers et actes appartenants
                                tant au navire qu’à sa cargaison.</p>
                            <p>Il est pareillement défendu, sous des peines sévères, tant au

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> Touching the subject of the neutrality of
                            Denmark in the present contest between Prussia and France, two events
                            have lately occurred of some interest. This government has forbidden the
                            further exportation of horses, an order which the government is entirely
                            competent to make, simply as a regulation of commerce; but which is done
                            notoriously in view of the possible exigencies of the present
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>The other fact is the arrival at this capital, a few days ago, of the
                            Marquis de Cadore, late French minister at Munich, which capital he
                            quitted when Bavaria so promptly espoused the cause of Germany, and who,
                            it is generally stated and credited, comes here as an envoy
                            extraordinary on special mission to this government.</p>
                        <p>Of course, such a visit at this juncture excites very great interest and
                            curiosity in political and diplomatic circles. But very little, indeed
                            nothing, has as yet transpired as to the object of his visit. There can
                            be no reasonable doubt that he left Paris for an important purpose, and,
                            probably, with definite instructions. But from all that can be learned
                            here he seems to have said and done so little as to give rise to the
                            suggestion that, upon arriving here, he found the programme altered or
                            modified. The Danish declaration of neutrality could scarcely have been
                            officially, perhaps not publicly, known at Paris when he left; he
                            traveled all the way from Cherbourg by sea, and by the time he arrived
                                <pb n="63" xml:id="pg_63" facs="0097"/>here, the publication by
                            Count Bismarck of the diplomatic proposals of France so seriously
                            affecting Belgium, and even the “Duchy” question pending between Denmark
                            and Prussia, may have suggested to the cabinet of Paris that an earnest
                            and successful effort by France to drag Denmark into the war might cost
                            too much in the form of other and adverse complications. It might draw
                            both England and Belgium into the war, and give still greater cause of
                            dissatisfaction to Russia. Of course, as an explanation of the Marquis
                            Cadore’s apparent inactivity, this is all speculation; but it has a
                            certain air of plausibility about it. While I deem it quite certain that
                            he came here for a definite and important purpose, I have reason to
                            doubt whether he is formally and officially accredited to this
                            government, and I know that up to yesterday evening he was not so
                            regarded by it, and had not established official relations with it. The
                            subject has become an interesting and important puzzle to the diplomatic
                            corps, and the more so as most of my colleagues are actively pressing
                            upon this government the wishes of their own governments that Denmark
                            should remain neutral. There is somewhat less confidence felt that this
                            attitude will be preserved than there was at the date of my last advices
                            upon that subject.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to my dispatch No. 253, it
                            appears that the Marquis de Cadore has not yet been formally and
                            officially presented to the King or to the Danish government, though he
                            has had several interviews. And if he has either accomplished or
                            proposed anything definite there is no means of knowing it, while there
                            is much evidence that he has not.</p>
                        <p>The opinion is receiving confirmation here that this is only to be
                            explained, by the considerations suggested in my last dispatch, and by
                            the additional fact that the early and brilliant victories counted upon
                            as an aid to French diplomacy have not occurred.</p>
                        <p>Public opinion here is entirely adverse and hostile to Prussia. It is as
                            belligerent as it can be without actually pushing armies and marines
                            into the contest. In Danish political circles the obvious criticism is
                            made upon the government’s declaration of its neutrality, that
                            neutrality seems rather the incident than the object of the document; a
                            criticism invited by its form, though probably not sustained by the
                            fact; for the government seems to be really in earnest, and recent
                            events in the field may dampen public ardor, or at least check its
                            expression.</p>
                        <p>The leading journals, in their discussions of the subject, have taken the
                            position, not very assuring to the cabinet of Berlin, if technically
                            true that, neutrality is at most only a state of peace—that is, not
                            actual war; that it depends on circumstances, and, like peace, may be
                            abandoned when circumstances, interest, policy, or duty indicate war as
                            the better course.</p>
                        <p>For the immediate present there seems no danger that the government will
                            abandon its policy of neutrality and become a party to the war.</p>

                            and say that if the French government consent thereto, the United States
                            will extend to North Germans same care which they extended to subjects
                            of the Emperor in Mexico, on Mr. Moustier’s request of July 19, ’67.</p>

                        <p>Berthemy asks, under instructions from Favre, whether [the] public
                            sentiment in America has changed since [the] change of government in
                            France, adding, on his part, that until now [the] republican press [in
                            this country] has expressed strong sympathy with Germany.</p>
                        <pb n="68" xml:id="pg_68" facs="0102"/>
                        <p>I reply that the Government maintains a strict neutrality, and will
                            continue so to do; that he cannot wonder the people have little sympathy
                            for a dynasty which countenanced giving aid to rebels during our war,
                            and tried to establish a monarchy on our southern borders; that, in my
                            judgment, the feeling to which he alluded was not against France or the
                            French people, of which he is as competent to judge as I; and that the
                            disposition of this Government is shown in the order of the President
                            already given to recognize the new government.</p>

                        <p rend="center">* * * * * *</p>
                        <p>About an hour after the receipt of your dispatch No. 266, Baron
                            Alvensleben (who is, in the absence of Baron Gerolt, in charge of North
                            German interests in Washington) called at the Department, and I took the
                            opportunity to read the dispatch to him at length. He expressed, in the
                            strongest terms, his satisfaction at what had been done. As soon as
                            copies can be made they will be sent to the North German legation for
                            transmission to Berlin.</p>
                        <p>I infer, from two allusions to my telegram of the 16th ultimo and my
                            subsequent telegram of the 17th ultimo, that you have misapprehended my
                            purpose in the second telegram.</p>
                        <p>It was my purpose in the first telegram, not only to give instructions as
                            to the representations to be made in regard to the <hi rend="italic"
                                >expulsion</hi> of the Germans, ordered by the <hi rend="italic"
                                >new</hi> ministry, but also to approve the excellent letter, then
                            just received, which you had written to the Duke de Gramont, (of the <hi
                                rend="italic">old</hi> ministry,) upon the obstacles which he
                            proposed to throw in the way of the <hi rend="italic">departure</hi> of
                            the Germans. In preparing the telegram the word expulsion was improperly
                            used with reference to the latter subject. The second telegram was
                            intended to correct that mistake.</p>
                        <p>I also inclose herein copies of all the other telegrams received at the
                            Department from you, or transmitted hence to you, since the date of the

                        <p>Bequest of Favre to instruct you to join other powers in efforts for
                            peace received. It is not the policy or interest of the United States to

                            them without assurance they will be accepted. President strongly desires
                            to see peace restored between two great powers now at war, with each of

                        <p>This Government desires and intends to maintain a perfect and strict
                            neutrality between the two powers now unfortunately engaged in war. It
                            desires also to extend to both the manifestation of its friendly feeling
                            in every possible way, and will allow to the vessels of war of each
                            power, equally, the hospitality of its ports and harbors for all proper
                            and friendly purposes.</p>
                        <p>But this hospitality is liable to abuse, and circumstances have arisen to
                            give rise in the minds of some persons to the apprehension that attempts
                            at such abuse have taken place.</p>
                        <p>I am not in possession of facts to justify me in saying that such has
                            been the case, but I have deemed myself justified in calling the
                            attention of M. Berthemy, the French representative at this capital, to
                            the current rumors, sustained as they are by the presence of a number of
                            French vessels upon the coast of the United States. These vessels have
                            appeared at or near the entrance of the harbor of New York, off Sandy
                            Hook; at the entrance of the Long Island Sound; at or near the entrance
                            of the Chesapeake Bay. One or more is represented to have been anchored
                            not far from Sandy Hook, (the main entrance to New York Harbor,) and
                            there is a difference of statement as to the precise distance at which
                            she lay from the shore; some claiming that she was within a marine
                            league. But of this there is no positive evidence. She has entered the
                            port of New York (as claimed by some) for the purpose of watching a
                            German steamer about to sail thence. Three of them have put into the
                            harbor of New London (which looks out upon Long Island Sound, the
                            eastern entrance to the New York Harbor) avowedly for some small
                            repairs; one recently asked permission, which was granted, to make some
                            repairs at the Norfolk navy yard, near the entrance of Chesapeake
                            Bay.</p>
                        <p>All this may be consistent with an intention of perfect observance of the
                            neutral character of our waters and jurisdiction, and with an entire
                            absence of undertaking any hostile movement against the vessels of North
                            Germany, from those waters, or that jurisdiction.</p>
                        <pb n="71" xml:id="pg_71" facs="0105"/>
                        <p>A large trade has been carried on from the ports of the United States,
                            approached by the waters in which these vessels have thus appeared, by
                            vessels belonging to North Germany.</p>
                        <p>The appearance of French vessels in these immediate neighborhoods, in
                            such numbers and force, does not fail to excite the alarm of these
                            vessels, and must have the effect to a greater or less degree to
                            diminish that trade.</p>
                        <p>The United States are not prepared at present to say that any actual
                            violation of international law has been committed, or that the
                            hospitality of these waters has been positively abused. But the hovering
                            of the vessels of war of a belligerent on the coasts near the entrance
                            of the principal ports of a friendly power does interfere with the trade
                            of the friendly power.</p>
                        <p>The interruption of the regular communication with you, by reason of the
                            investment of Paris, has lead me to represent to M. Berthemy our views
                            on this subject, and to say that, although the vessels of either
                            belligerents may not actually shelter within the jurisdiction of the
                            United States and proceed thence against the vessels of its enemy, this
                            Government would regard as an unfriendly act the hovering of such
                            vessels upon the coast of the United States, near to its shores, in the
                            neighborhood of its ports, and in the track of the ordinary commerce of
                            these ports, with intent to intercept the vessels of trade of its
                            enemy.</p>
                        <p>I have requested M. Berthemy to make known these views to the French
                            government, and to express the confident hope of the President that
                            there may be no cause of complaint on the part of this Government by
                            reason of any such hovering by the vessels of the French government.</p>
                        <p>You will be pleased to take an early opportunity to present the same view
                            to the minister for foreign affairs, which you may do by reading to him
                            this dispatch.</p>

                        <p>Your dispatch No. 304, of the 18th ultimo, with its inclosures, relative
                            to the obstructions and conditions imposed by the force blockading Paris
                            to the communication of the representatives of neutral powers there with
                            their governments, has been received.</p>
                        <p>The impression here is that the course of the Prussian authorities on
                            that subject is derogatory to the rights of neutrals under the public
                            law. The views of this Department are more particularly set forth in the
                            instruction to Mr. Bancroft of the 11th instant, No. 264, and in the
                            note to Baron Gerolt of yesterday, copies of which are herewith
                            transmitted.</p>
                        <p>It is at least questionable whether, if the case were reversed and the
                            diplomatic representative of Prussia were dwelling in the invested
                            capital of a foreign country, the Prussian government would be willing
                            to abide by the position which it has taken upon this question at Paris.
                            In view, however, of the hitherto almost unchecked success of their
                            arms, showing the wisdom, efficiency, and power of their military
                            system, it is not unnatural to expect from them at least a leaning
                            toward an assertion of extreme belligerent claims. It is hoped that they
                            may not on any future occasion have reason to regret the course taken in
                            the instance referred to, especially as it is impossible to believe it
                            to have been necessary for the accomplishment of the military object
                            which they had in view.</p>

                        <p>On receipt yesterday of your dispatch of the 16th instant, in reference
                            to the North German steamers, I waited immediately upon the minister of
                            foreign affairs. In his absence I saw Count Favernay, the “chef de
                            cabinet.” I read your dispatch to him and promised to send him an
                            official dispatch upon the subject, which I did that evening. Count
                            Favernay said that he was of course unable to answer the inquiry, but
                            that he would mention it to the Duke de Gramont and would give an early
                            answer. No answer has yet been received—Monday evening.</p>
                        <p>I also received your telegram yesterday upon the subject of protection to
                            be extended to North German subjects residing on French territory. I
                            deciphered it with some difficulty, many letters in important words
                            having been changed in the transmission. Having mastered the contents, I
                            wrote at once to the minister of foreign affairs, reciting the request
                            of the ambassador of North Germany and the authorization of my
                            Government, provided that the assent of the imperial government was
                            first obtained, and requested that this assent might be granted. A
                            prompt answer was returned giving the entire assent of his Majesty’s
                            government—“entier assentiment.” I at once notified Count Solms, the
                            chargé d’affaires of the North German Confederation, the ambassador
                            having left Paris on Saturday.</p>

                        <p>I have nothing of interest to add to my dispatch No. 220, of July 14. The
                            armies are gathering in overwhelming numbers on the banks of the Rhine.
                            It is reported that the Emperor will leave Paris to take command of the
                            army on Saturday next. Meantime France is hurrying forward her troops
                            with great dispatch, anxious to strike the first blow.</p>
                        <p>Both powers have given assurances to England of the strict observance of
                            the neutrality of Belgium. No doubt for a short time they will observe
                            this neutrality, but when armies of 200,000 men are in face on so narrow
                            a front as the line between France and Prussia, one or the other, to
                            gain a great strategical advantage, will invade Belgium, and, perhaps,
                            Switzerland and Holland too.</p>

                        <p>Referring to the subject of the request made by you on the 17th instant,
                            that I should inquire whether, in the event of war between France and
                            the North German Confederation, the North German steamers would be
                            exempt from capture, I have the honor to transmit you herewith—</p>
                        <p>First. A letter of Colonel Hoffman to the Duke de Gramont on this
                            subject.</p>
                        <p>Second. A translation of a reply of the Duke de Gramont to the letter of
                            Colonel Hoffman, received the 21st instant.</p>

                                would be a serious inconvenience to our Post Office Department.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The consignees of the German steamers
                                established between Hamburg, Bremen, and New York, stopping at
                                Havre, have applied to the cabinet of Washington to know if they
                                could, notwithstanding the war, continue their traffic without being
                                exposed to capture, and Mr. Hoffman was in consequence charged to
                                ask of me what are, in this respect, the intentions of the
                                government of the Emperor.</p>
                            <p>My colleague, the minister of the marine, whom I have just consulted
                                upon this subject, desires me, with reason, to observe that the
                                steamers in question are enemies’ ships, and do not find themselves
                                in any of the conditions required in order that, after the opening
                                of hostilities, they may permanently be exceptionably authorized to
                                continue the mercantile operations to which they are devoted. It is
                                true that, like all merchant ships, they take charge of letters or
                                of mails, the carriage of which, according to the federal laws,
                                gives a right to compensation from the American treasury. But this
                                compensation, whatever may be its form, cannot in any way influence
                                the hostile and private character of the ship which receives it, nor
                                consequently justify any exception to the general principle of the
                                law of nations, of the character of that to which the telegraphic
                                dispatch, which Mr. Hoffman did me the honor to communicate to me on
                                the 18th of this month, refers.</p>
                            <p>The government of the Emperor feels, therefore, regret that it cannot
                                resolve favorably the question put by the consignees of the Bremen
                                and Hamburg steamers. However, and in order to save in a certain
                                measure the complex interests engaged in these ships, we are
                                disposed to exempt from capture those among them which are actually
                                at sea, and which, in ignorance of the state of war, may enter one
                                of the ports of the empire. I hope that the suspension of service
                                performed by the company of Lloyd and of North Germany will not have
                                for the federal Post Office the disagreeable consequences which it
                                appears to apprehend, as the English and French packet-boats from
                                Liverpool and from Havre will not cease to keep up regular
                                communication between the United States and Europe. Receive
                                &amp;c.</p>

                        <p>Count Solms, charge d’affaires of the North German Confederation, left
                            here for Berlin on Wednesday night, after turning over to this legation
                            the archives of the embassy to which he belonged. He expressed himself
                            as much gratified with the courtesy which we have extended to him in
                            receiving the archives of his embassy, and in assuming the protection of
                            the subjects of the sovereign whom he represented.</p>
                        <p>Many subjects of the North German Confederacy found themselves here upon
                            the formal declaration of war, and the count left with me sufficient
                            funds to pay the expenses of a certain number of them, who would be
                            directed to call at this legation to obtain the proper authorization to
                            leave the French territory. Accordingly many have presented themselves
                            during the past three days to receive some proper instrument that will
                            enable them to go out of France. I was unwilling to give any paper or
                            certificate, in the nature of a visa, unless I was satisfied it would be
                            respected by the French military and civil authorities. I therefore went
                            to the Foreign Office yesterday to state the case and to ascertain
                            whether these North German subjects would be permitted to leave, and, if
                            so, upon what kind of a protection, to be issued by me. I was there

                            best for me to state my object in writing. I then addressed a letter to
                            the Duke de Gramont, a copy of which is herewith inclosed, marked I was
                            promised an answer to this letter before this time; but now, at five

                            the way of England.</p>

                            of his Majesty the Emperor; also the reply of the Duke de Gramont

                            <p>Referring to the letter of Colonel Hoffman, of the 17th instant, to
                                your excellency, in relation to putting the subjects of the North
                                German Confederation residing in French territory under the
                                protection of this legation, and the response of your excellency of
                                the following day, giving the entire consent of the French
                                government thereto, I have the honor to state that quite a number of
                                the citizens of the North German Confederation, finding themselves
                                in Paris at the time of the declaration of war, have applied to me
                                for such protection as will enable them to leave the French
                                territory. I have, therefore, now to apply to your excellency to
                                know whether any certificate in the nature of a visa, given by me to
                                these subjects of the North German Confederation, will be so far
                                respected as to enable them to pass into the neutral territory of
                                Belgium. I have to state that there will be no more than one hundred
                                of these persons, and they are mostly poor men who have been
                                necessarily detained here by reasons over which they had no control,
                                and who are extremely desirous of leaving France.</p>
                            <p>In this connection I beg leave to observe that I only desire to
                                conform to what is due to the function which I have undertaken in
                                this respect, with the assent of the government of his Majesty the
                                Emperor. While, perhaps, under a strict construction of public law,
                                the government of his Majesty would have the absolute right to treat
                                as enemies of war all of the subjects of the North German
                                Confederation finding themselves in France after the 19th instant,
                                yet under the modern and more humane interpretation given to that
                                right, the government of his Majesty might deem it consistent with
                                its views to permit these men to leave the territory of France
                                within the reasonable time which the text-writers observe has become
                                the usual concession of nations engaged in war.</p>
                            <p>I will thank you to advise me upon this subject at the earliest
                                convenient moment, so that I can inform these men in regard to their
                                application. If permission be granted, I beg to request that I may
                                be informed of the nature of the certificate to be given by me,
                                which will be respected by the military and civil authorities of his
                                Majesty’s government. * * * * * * * *</p>

                            <p>I hasten to inform you, in answer to the letter you did me the honor
                                to write to me on the 23d of this month, that the government of the
                                Emperor gives its entire assent in order that you may assume, during
                                the war, the protection of the subjects of Hesse Grand-Ducale,
                                residing in France.</p>
                            <p>Receive the assurances of the high consideration with which I have
                                the honor to be, sir, your very humble servant,</p>

                        <p>Referring to my dispatch of the 22d instant, numbered 231, and to the
                            reference therein to the question of the departure of the subjects of
                                <pb n="81" xml:id="pg_81" facs="0115"/>the North German
                            Confederation from French territory, I now have the honor to send you
                            the continuation of the correspondence on that subject. It consists
                            of—</p>
                        <p>First. The reply of the Duke de Gramont to my letter of the 21st instant,
                            marked No. 1, and</p>
                        <p>Second. My rejoinder to his excellency’s letter, dated the 25th instant,
                            and marked No. 2.</p>
                        <p>It is difficult for me to determine the precise nature and extent of the
                            functions devolving upon me in virtue of the protection of the subjects
                            of the North German Confederation, which I have assumed by your
                            direction and with the assent of the French government. I cannot find
                            that any particular rule has been laid down to govern under such
                            circumstances, and I would be thankful if you could make any suggestions
                            in that regard. But it must be presumed that I am to extend my good
                            offices in every proper manner to such of the North German subjects as
                            may call upon me for advice or protection, but guarding myself carefully
                            against any act which might be construed as inconsistent with the
                            neutral position I occupy. In regard, however, to the doctrines
                            submitted by the Duke de Gramont, in his letter to me of the 23d
                            instant, touching the departure of North German subjects from French
                            territory, I considered them as differing so widely from the
                            well-established principles of public law, at least as understood and
                            acted upon in our own country, that I could not give them even an
                            implied assent. Hence my letter to the Duke de Gramont of the 25th
                            instant, to which I have already made reference herein, and which I
                            trust may meet with your approbation.</p>

                            <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Minister</hi>: You have done me the honor to
                                inform me that a large number of persons belonging to the North
                                German Confederation have asked your good offices to enable them to
                                return to their country, passing through Belgian territory, and you
                                are good enough to ask me at the same time if the passports given or
                                signed by you would constitute sufficient evidence to assure
                                security in the journey to these persons.</p>
                            <p>As you have seen, Mr. Minister, by the notice inserted in the Journal
                                Officiel of the 20th of this month, the government of the Emperor
                                has decided that German citizens will be at liberty to continue
                                their residence in France, and that they will enjoy the protection
                                of our laws as before the war, as long as their conduct does not
                                give any legitimate cause of complaint. Nothing is altered in the
                                design of his Majesty in this regard.</p>
                            <p>In regard to that which now concerns the North Germans who desire to
                                leave the territory of the empire, in order to return into their own
                                country, the government of the Emperor is disposed to accede to the
                                desires of those individuals who are past the age of active military
                                service, reserving the right to examine each particular case as it
                                is presented. Regarding the national confederates who do not find
                                themselves in this situation, and who would like to leave France to
                                respond to the summons of their government which calls them lawfully
                                to return to bear arms against us, the government of the Emperor
                                will not allow their departure. In adopting this line of conduct we
                                have the desire to reconcile, in an equitable degree, the
                                considerations due to respectable private interests with the
                                legitimate exigencies of a state of war. You will please to observe,
                                sir, that the confederate Prussians, whose departure from our
                                territory we prevent for the moment, can with difficulty invoke in
                                their favor the general principles of the law of nations, or the
                                doctrine of the text-writers on this subject. In fact, the German
                                subjects, whom the decision which I have the honor to inform you of
                                concerns, cannot legally be considered as simply private
                                individuals, nor be assimilated to merchants; they are incontestibly
                                persons bound to military service as soldiers of the active army or
                                of the landwehr. Now no rule of international law obliges a
                                belligerent to allow to <pb n="82" xml:id="pg_82" facs="0116"
                                />depart from his territory subjects of the enemy, who, from the day
                                of their return to their own country, will be enrolled in the ranks
                                to take part in the hostilities. I will add, in conclusion, that
                                except the obstacle put in the way of their departure from France,
                                the German citizens in question will enjoy the most complete liberty
                                to attend to their business, to carry on their commerce, their
                                industries, or their professions; in other words they will be
                                precisely on the same footing as those of their compatriots
                                mentioned in the official note of the 20th of this month.</p>
                            <p>Accept the assurances of the high consideration with which I have the
                                honor to be, sir, your very humble and obedient servant,</p>

                                receipt of your excellency’s communication of the 23d, in reply to
                                mine of the 21st, asking information in behalf of North German
                                confederate subjects desiring to quit French territory.</p>
                            <p>Your excellency’s communication seems to assume the probability that
                                more or less of these applicants are desirous of quitting France to
                                answer to the summons of their own governmont to bear arms against
                                France, under the provisions of the laws of the North German
                                confederation. Without undertaking to contest the exactness of this
                                assumption, or without undertaking to inform your excellency whether
                                any or what portion of these applicants are to be found outside of
                                the present limits of liability to bear arms in the ranks of the
                                confederation in case of their return to North Germany, matters upon
                                which I have not particularly informed myself, you will allow me to
                                remark, in loyal fulfillment of the function that has been confided
                                to me in this regard, that I was not prepared to learn that the
                                exception now proposed to be made by the government of his Majesty
                                to the disadvantage of a portion, perhaps the largest portion, of
                                the applicants would be insisted on, viz., that a liability to
                                perform military service in the home army constitutes a sufficient
                                reason for the refusal of the ordinary privilege of quitting foreign
                                belligerent territory, on the outbreak of a war between that foreign
                                government and the home nation. If the exception stated by your
                                excellency is to constitute a settled principle of international
                                comity, for I at once concede that there is no question of <hi
                                    rend="italic">absolute right,</hi> but only of comity or social
                                civilization, involved in the decision in the case of these
                                applicants, then I beg leave to suggest that the exception becomes
                                the rule, and that the privilege of returning to one’s own country
                                at the outbreak of a war becomes a mere nullity; since, of what male
                                subject, of whatever age or of whatever condition of life, may it
                                not be affirmed that at some time or under some circumstances he may
                                be compelled to join the ranks of his country’s armies in her
                                defense; say in some sudden or extreme emergency? And is a
                                distinction to be made between those countries which limit the
                                conscription of their soldiers to a very restricted section of their
                                population, and those governments which, like Prussia, the United
                                States, and perhaps Switzerland, being much the larger proportion of
                                their citizens under the reach of the law of military service? Will
                                your excellency allow me respectfully to suggest that in the limited
                                examination which I have been able to give to this subject, I find
                                the line of exception now suggested to his Majesty’s government to
                                the general concession usually made in favor of foreign subjects
                                wishing to quit belligerent territory an entirely new one. Even in
                                feudal times, when the liability to do military duty to the
                                sovereign Lord or king was held in much greater strictness than at
                                the present day, I do not find that the point was insisted upon of
                                the returning liege being liable to become a hostile soldier.
                                Certainly, under my own Government, from which perhaps I borrow my
                                prepossessions; the idea of any such distinction seems to have been
                                long since discarded. For as early as 1798, and when hostilities
                                between the United States and France seemed imminent, probably I may
                                say in reference to the departure of French subjects from United
                                States territory, my own Government, by formal statute, declared
                                that subjects of the hostile nation, who might wish to quit the
                                United States on the outbreak of future hostilities, should be
                                allowed “such reasonable time as may be consistent with the public
                                safety, and according to the dictates of humanity and national
                                hospitality,” and “for the recovery, disposal, and removal of their
                                goods and effects, and for their departure.” [Laws of the United
                                States, vol. 1, page 577.] Thus your excellency will observe that
                                the privilege is granted in the most unrestricted terms, without
                                allusion to a liability to render military aid to an enemy. I need
                                not add that the same principle is incorporated <pb n="83"
                                    xml:id="pg_83" facs="0117"/>into various subsisting treaties of
                                the United States, and that the highest American authority on public
                                law, Chancellor Kent, considers the principle to have become an
                                established formula of modem public law. This learned publicist, I
                                may perhaps be permitted to add, quotes various continental
                                publicists, including Emerigon and Vattel, as upholding and
                                ratifying the same doctrine. [<hi rend="italic">Kent’s
                                    Commentaries</hi>, <hi rend="italic">vol.</hi> 1, <hi

                            <p>I trust that these suggestions of a liberal construction of the
                                rights of departing belligerents will not be deemed inappropriate or
                                untimely on my part, since your excellency does not apprise me that
                                any public notice of the qualified restraints foreshadowed in your
                                communication have yet been definitely made public, and since from
                                that liberal concession in favor of belligerent residents who do not
                                choose to depart, which his Majesty’s government has published, and
                                to which your excellency has alluded, I deduce an anxious desire on
                                the part of that government to conform as much as possible to the
                                mildest interpretation of the hardships of the laws of war.</p>
                            <p>It only remains for me to say that if his Majesty’s government has
                                definitely decided the question of the privilege of departing
                                subjects of the North German Confederation, in the limited sense
                                which your excellency’s communication seems to imply, it would
                                relieve me of trouble in the way of answering personal applications,
                                if the French government should deem it proper to make a public
                                announcement of its determination upon that point, or to advise me
                                by a personal communication. I should also be glad to be informed if
                                my own intervention or agency can be of any avail in enabling his
                                Majesty’s officials to judge of the fitness of granting the
                                departure of those particular applicants who may happen to be
                                without the limits of the age of military service in the North
                                German Confederation army, and as to which you intimate that the
                                French government reserves to itself the right of judging each case
                                as it shall arise. I take the present occasion, &amp;c., &amp;c.,

                                will be your duty to give every proper assistance, consistent with

                                any certificate should be as follows:</p>

                            <p>As regards passports and visas, the French government has decided
                                that it will not authorize the departure from French territory of
                                such subjects of the North German Confederation as owe military

                        <p>In addition to what I have said in the various dispatches which go by the
                            bag to-day, I have very little to add. The Emperor left for the army
                            yesterday. I send you his decree conferring on the Empress the title of
                            Regent, which appeared in the Journal Officiel of the 27th instant.</p>
                        <p>Paris is exceedingly quiet, and there is nothing whatever in the shape of
                            war news.</p>
                        <p>The English and French journals which you receive at the State Department
                            will advise you fully in regard to all matters connected with the
                            alleged project of a treaty between France and Prussia. This affair has
                            created a great sensation in the diplomatic and other circles of Paris.
                            The note from the Journal Officiel on this subject which I inclose
                            renders it evident that a scheme of alliance between France and Prussia
                            was discussed at Berlin, and that some of the ideas contained in the
                            published project were then suggested. This matter has gone so far now
                            that it must be probed to the very bottom. Nothing less than the whole
                            truth will satisfy the public and the nations of the earth.</p>

                            <p>The Journal Officiel publishes the following important decree:</p>
                            <p>“Napoleon, by the grace of God and the national will, Emperor of the
                                French, to all whom these presents may concern, greeting:</p>
                            <p>“Wishing to give to our well-beloved consort, the Empress, a proof of
                                the confidence which we have in her, and having the intention to
                                place ourselves at the head of the army, we have resolved to confer,
                                and do hereby confer, on the Empress the title of Regent, to
                                exercise the functions of that charge as soon as we shall have left
                                our capital, in conformity with our instructions and orders as we
                                shall have given them in the general directions of the service which
                                we shall have established, and which will be transcribed on the book
                                of state. Our intention is to communicate to our ministers the said
                                orders and instructions, and that in no case the Empress can depart
                                from their <pb n="85" xml:id="pg_85" facs="0119"/>rigor, in the
                                exercise of her functions of Regent. We desire that the Empress
                                shall preside in our name over the Council of Ministers, We do not,
                                however, intend that the Empress-Regent shall authorize by her
                                signature the promulgation of any law other than those now pending
                                before the senate, the legislative body, and the council of state,
                                referring on that subject to the orders and instructions above
                                mentioned. We order our keeper of the seals, minister of justice and
                                public worship, to communicate the present letters-patent to the
                                senate, which will inscribe them on its books, and publish them in

                            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Journal Officiel</hi> publishes an imperial
                                decree declaring the departments of the Moselle, the Haut-Rhin, and
                                the Bas-Rhin to be in a state of siege. A second decree calls into
                                active service the 90,000 men forming the contingent of the class of
                                1869. A third appoints a committee presided over by the Empress, and
                                consisting of seventeen members, among whom are the ministers of the
                                interior, finance, war, and marine, for distributing the patriotic
                                offerings made, according to the intentions of the donors. A fourth
                                names General of Division Canu to be aid-de-camp to the Emperor.</p>
                            <p>The Paris journals continue to remark on the draught of the treaty
                                published by the Times, and all, without exception, seem to think
                                that it merits but little attention. The Pays and Peuple Français
                                declare that something of the kind was formerly proposed by Count de
                                Bismarck to the Emperor, but emphatically set aside by the latter.
                                Others of our contemporaries draw attention to the fact that in the
                                wording the name of Prussia comes first, as is always the case with
                                the designation and titles of the proposing party. The
                                Constitutionnel expresses itself as follows:</p>
                            <p>“The Times, with a rashness of judgment unworthy of so important an
                                organ, affirms that the project of partition was proposed by France
                                to Prussia, and, starting from that assumption, it seeks to excite
                                public opinion in England against the Emperor Napoleon’s government.
                                Well, this time, the London newspaper has been badly served by its
                                Prussian inspirers. The veracity of the statesmen of Berlin cannot
                                be depended upon. For a long time they have been accustomed to tread
                                under foot treaties, to deny their acts and their words, if such a
                                course was useful to their designs, to disregard, in a word, all
                                good faith and straightforwardness. The French government has not to
                                fear the broad daylight, and it does not recoil from any species of
                                disclosure. Let every one know, then, that the projected Fran
                                co-Prussian treaty, published by the Times and other organs of Count
                                de Bismarck, really exists; only—and this is the essential point—it
                                is the work of the federal chancellor. Does not every one remember
                                the famous phrase of the Prussian minister, after Sadowa, when a
                                question arose of compensations for France: ‘Instead of speaking of
                                equivalents,’ he exclaimed, ‘she ought to take Belgium!’ That
                                expression is the point of departure of the convention by the aid of
                                which M. de Bismarck hoped to purchase the acquiescence of France in
                                the conquest of Prussia. The Emperor’s government rejected those
                                offers, which prove that, to the Prussian chancellor, all means were
                                good to obtain a sanction for his policy of violence and iniquity.
                                Public opinion is therefore enlightened on this project; it has had
                                a fresh proof of the count’s cynicism, as, at the risk of a
                                categorical denial, he has gone so far as to attribute to France
                                schemes of spoliation conceived by himself. But what does M. de
                                Bismarck care about denials, and what do they cost him? Did he not
                                also dispute the affirmation of the Duke de Gramont that, in March
                                1869, Count Benedetti, by order of the imperial government,
                                protested against the Hohenzollern candidature, and that the
                                Prussian ministers then pledged their honor that the affair should
                                not be proceeded with? Well, MM. de Bismarck and de Thile, after
                                having failed in their word of honor, aggravated their fault by a
                                contradiction, of which we immediately pointed out the ambiguous
                                character. The new circular of the minister for foreign affairs
                                completely confounds the Berlin cabinet. Doubt is no longer possible
                                when one has read the dispatch of M. Benedetti, dated the 31st
                                March, 1869; at that period Count de Bismarck had already conceived
                                the project the realization of which has been prevented by the manly
                                energy of the Duke de Gramont. The document lately issued by the
                                minister of foreign affairs proves also that in the phase of
                                negotiations which preceded the declaration of war, frankness and
                                correct proceedings were on the side of the imperial government, and
                                that subterfuges and perfidy were on that of Prussia.”</p>
                            <p>The Journal Officiel gives the subjoined explanation:</p>
                            <p>“The Times publishes a pretended treaty between France and Prussia,
                                having for object to facilitate the annexation to France of
                                Luxembourg and Belgium, on condition that she should not oppose the
                                union of the states of Southern Germany with the Northern
                                Confederation. After the treaty of Prague some negotiations did
                                certainly take place at Berlin between Count de Bismarck and the
                                French embassy on the subject of a proposed alliance. Some of the
                                ideas contained in the document inserted by the Times were mooted,
                                but the French government never had any knowledge of a plan <pb
                                    n="86" xml:id="pg_86" facs="0120"/>drawn up in writing, and as
                                to the proposals which may have formed the subject of conversation
                                in those interviews they were rejected by the Emperor Napoleon. No
                                one will fail to see in what interest and with what object efforts
                                are being made to mislead public opinion in England.”</p>

                                the full explanation of the telegram addressed by Count de Bismarck
                                to the Prussian ambassador at London, to announce to England the
                                pretended secrets of which the federal chancellor stated himself to
                                be the depositary. His communication adds no essential fact to those
                                which he had advanced. We find in it only a few additional
                                improbabilities. We shall not reply to them, for public opinion has
                                already treated as they deserved assertions which do not gain any
                                authority from the audacity with which they are repeated, and we
                                consider as definitively established, in spite of all contradiction,
                                the fact that the Emperor Napoleon never proposed to Prussia a
                                treaty for taking possession of Belgium. That idea belongs to M. de
                                Bismarck; it was one of the expedients of that unscrupulous policy
                                which, we hope, is approaching its termination.</p>
                            <p>I should therefore abstain from reverting to statements, the falsity
                                of which is now manifest, had not the author of the Prussian
                                dispatch, with a want of tact which I remark for the first time to
                                such a degree in a diplomatic document, spoken of relatives of the
                                Emperor as bearers of compromising messages and confidences.
                                Whatever may be the repugnance with which I see myself forced, in
                                order to follow the Prussian minister, to enter on a path contrary
                                to my habits, I overcome that sentiment because my duty requires me
                                to repel the perfidious insinuations which, directed against the
                                members of the imperial family, are evidently intended to reach the
                                Emperor himself.</p>
                            <p>It was at Berlin that M. de Bismarck, taking the initiative of the
                                ideas which he now wishes to attribute to us, addressed in the
                                following terms the French prince, whom, in spite of all propriety,
                                he at present drags into the controversy:</p>
                            <p>“You seek,” he said, “what is impossible; you wish to take the
                                Rhenish provinces, <pb n="87" xml:id="pg_87" facs="0121"/>which are
                                German. Why not annex Belgium, where a people exists which has the
                                same origin, the same religion, and the same language as yourselves?
                                I have already suggested the idea to the Emperor; if he entertained
                                my views, we would aid you to take that state. As for myself, if I
                                was master, and was not hampered by the King’s obstinacy, it would
                                have been already done.”</p>
                            <p>Those words of the Prussian chancellor were, so to say, repeated
                                literally to the court of France by Count de Goltz. That ambassador
                                so little attempted concealment, that the number of witnesses who
                                heard him is considerable. I may add that, at the period of the
                                Universal Exhibition, the overtures of Prussia were known to several
                                high personages, who took note of them, and still remember them.
                                Besides, this was not a mere passing idea with the count, but a
                                well-concerted project, to which his ambitious plans were attached;
                                and he pursued its execution with a perseverance thoroughly proved
                                by his numerous excursions to France, either to Biarritz or
                                elsewhere. He failed before the unshakable determination of the
                                Emperor, who always refused to join in a policy unworthy of his
                                integrity.</p>
                            <p>I now leave this subject, which I have touched on for the last time,
                                with the firm intention of not again reverting to it; and I come to
                                the point, really new, in Count de Bismarck’s dispatch:</p>
                            <p>“I have, beside, reason to believe,” he says, “that had the
                                publication in question not taken place, so soon as our and the
                                French preparations for war were complete, propositions would have
                                been made to us by France jointly, and at the head of a million
                                armed men, to carry out against unarmed Europe the proposals
                                formerly made to us, and either before or after the first battle to
                                conclude peace on the basis of the Benedetti proposals, and at the
                                expense of Belgium.”</p>
                            <p>The Emperor’s government cannot tolerate such an assertion. In the
                                face of Europe, his Majesty’s ministers defy M. de Bismarck to bring
                                forward any fact whatever which could lead to the supposition they
                                have manifested, directly or indirectly, by official channels or
                                through secret agents, the intention to unite with Prussia to
                                accomplish with her on Belgium the violence consummated on
                                Hanover.</p>
                            <p>We have not opened any negotiations with the Prussian minister either
                                on the subject of Belgium or on any other matter. Far from seeking
                                war, as we have been accused of doing, we begged Lord Clarendon to
                                intervene with the federal chancellor to procure a reciprocal
                                disarmament, an important mission with which his lordship, through
                                friendship for France and devotedness to ideas of peace, consented
                                to undertake confidentially. The following are the terms in which
                                Count Darn, in a letter of the 1st February, explained the
                                intentions of the government to the Marquis de la Valette, our
                                ambassador at London:</p>
                            <p>“It is certain that I shall not mix myself up in this affair, and
                                that I should not ask England to do so, if the question was purely
                                and simply an ordinary proceeding and one of pure form, made simply
                                to furnish M. de Bismarck with an occasion to express once more his
                                refusal. The overture which we make is decided, serious, and
                                positive.</p>
                            <p>“The principal secretary of state seems to expect from Count de
                                Bismarck a first movement of displeasure and ill humor. That is
                                possible, but not certain. In that provision we shall perhaps do
                                well to prepare the ground so as to avoid a negative reply from the
                                commencement.</p>
                            <p>“I am convinced that time and reflection will lead the chancellor to
                                take into serious consideration the proposal of England; should he
                                not at once reject all overtures, the interests of Prussia and of
                                the whole of Germany will be sufficient to moderate his resistance.
                                He would not wish to excite against him public opinion throughout
                                his country. What, in fact, would be his position if we deprived him
                                of the only pretext behind which he can take refuge, by
                                disarming?”</p>
                            <p>Count de Bismarck replied first that he could not take on himself to
                                inform the King of the suggestions of the British government, and
                                that he was sufficiently acquainted with the views of his sovereign
                                to know what the impressions of William I would be. The King, he
                                said, would certainly consider such a step on the part of the
                                cabinet of London as the proof of a change in the dispositions of
                                England toward Prussia. In fine, the federal chancellor declared
                                that “it was impossible for Prussia to modify a military system so
                                deeply rooted in the traditions of the country, which formed one of
                                the bases of its constitution, and which was quite normal.”</p>
                            <p>Count Daru did not accept that reply as definitive, and on the 13th
                                February wrote to the Marquis de la Valette as follows:</p>
                            <p>“I hope that Lord Clarendon will not take that answer as final and
                                will not be discouraged. We will shortly give him an opportunity of
                                returning to the charge, if he is disposed to do so, and to take up
                                the conversation which has been interrupted with the federal
                                chancellor. Our intention is, in fact, to diminish our contingent;
                                we should have reduced it considerably if we had obtained a
                                favorable reply from Count de Bismarck; we shall decrease it less,
                                as his answer is negative, but we shall nevertheless diminish it.
                                The reduction I shall propose will be 10,000 men.</p>
                            <p>“We shall thus be affirming by acts, which are always better than
                                words, our intentions and our policy. Nine contingents, each reduced
                                by 10,000 will make a total diminution <pb n="88" xml:id="pg_88"
                                    facs="0122"/>of 90,000. That is already something; it is a tenth
                                of our present force, and I regret that I am not able to do more.
                                The bill on the contingent will be brought forward immediately. Lord
                                Clarendon will then have to consider whether there will be an
                                advisability of representing to Count de Bismarck that the Prussian
                                government is alone in Europe in not making any concession to the
                                spirit of peace, and that it is thus placing itself in a grave
                                situation in the midst of European society, because it is furnishing
                                arms against itself to every one, including the populations crushed
                                beneath the burden of the military charges it imposes on them.”</p>
                            <p>Count de Bismarck, being closely pressed, thought necessary to enter
                                into some fresh explanations with Lord Clarendon.</p>
                            <p>Those explanations, as we are acquainted with them by a letter of the
                                Marquis de la Valette, dated the 23d February, were full of
                                reticences. The chancellor of the Prussian Confederation,
                                reconsidering his first resolution, had communicated to King William
                                the proposal of England, but his Majesty had declined it. In support
                                of that refusal the chancellor alleged the fear of an eventual
                                alliance between Austria and the states of Southern Germany, and the
                                ideas of aggrandizement which France might have. But he especially
                                put forward the anxiety with which he said he was filled by the
                                policy of Russia, and entered on that subject into private
                                considerations on the court of St. Petersburg, which I prefer to
                                pass over in silence, not wishing to repeat offensive insinuations.
                                Such are the motives of refusal which Count de Bismarck opposed to
                                the frank and conscientious entreaties repeatedly renewed by Lord
                                Clarendon at the request of the Emperor’s government.</p>
                            <p>If, therefore, Europe has remained in arms; if a million of men are
                                about to come into collision on fields of battle, the fact can no
                                longer be contested that the responsibility for such a state of
                                things rests with Prussia; for she rejected all ideas of disarming
                                when we made the proposal to her, and when we commenced by giving an
                                example. Is not that conduct besides explained by the fact that at
                                the same moment in which confiding France was diminishing her
                                contingent, the cabinet of Berlin was organizing in secret the
                                provocatory candidateship of a Prussian prince? Whatever may be the
                                calumnies invented by the federal chancellor, we have no fear; he
                                has lost the right of being believed. The public conscience of
                                Europe and history will say that Prussia sought for the present war
                                by inflicting on France, preoccupied by the development of her
                                political institutions, the outrage which no proud and courageous
                                people could have submitted to without deserving the contempt of the
                                nations.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In my dispatch of Friday last, August 5,
                            No. 246, I ventured the prediction that there would be no great battle
                            immediately, though qualifying it in parentheses, that such a battle
                            might occur any day. When writing that dispatch on Friday forenoon
                            little did I suppose that there had been a very serious fight on the day
                            before at Weissenbourg, on the French frontier, which had resulted in a
                            practical defeat of the French army. Although the London Times of that
                            (Friday) morning contained a dispatch from Berlin, giving an account of
                            the battle, yet the French public were kept in utter ignorance of it
                            until between twelve and one o’clock of that day, when a very brief
                            notice of the affair was communicated to the press by the French
                            authorities. The suppression of the intelligence for so long a time
                            excited a good deal of indignation among the public, and the Parisian
                            newspapers are particularly indignant that the London Times should have
                            published the news six or eight hours before it was given to them.
                            Things, however, passed on quietly enough until about noon on Saturday,
                            when, as the report goes, a man in the uniform of a courier, or
                            messenger, rode up to the front of the Bourse, where a large crowd had
                            already assembled, and delivered into the hands of a person, who was
                            evidently his confederate, what purported <pb n="89" xml:id="pg_89"
                                facs="0123"/>to be an official dispatch, and which gave an account
                            of a great battle having been fought, in which the French had been
                            victorious, taken forty guns, twenty-five thousand prisoners, among whom
                            was included the Crown Prince. A spark of fire falling upon a magazine
                            would hardly have produced a greater explosion. The assembled multitude
                            broke out into the wildest shouts and the contents of the dispatch were
                            repeated from mouth to mouth and men ran in every direction
                            communicating the joyful intelligence. The people rushed into the
                            streets; flags were everywhere displayed, men embraced and kissed each
                            other, shedding tears of joy. Shouts, vociferations, and oaths filled
                            the air and probably such a delirium was never before witnessed. Rue
                            Richelieu, the Boulevards Montmartre and Italiens, and the Rue de la
                            Paix were filled with people singing the Marseillaise. Everybody
                            declared that the news was true; they had seen the official report;
                            there could be no doubt of its correctness. Madame Sass, a distinguished
                            opera singer, was found in the street and the crowd insisted upon her
                            singing the Marseillaise from her carriage, which she sang three times
                            amid transports of enthusiasm. In another part of the street the
                            multitude forced another distinguished singer to mount to the top of an
                            omnibus, also to sing the Marseillaise. After the first furore of the
                            enthusiasm had subsided some persons began to suggest that it would be
                            well to inquire a little further into the news, and of course the result
                            was that it proved to be a stupendous hoax. The songs at once ceased,
                            the flags were taken in, and the victims of the canard began to feel
                            indignant. As it originated at the Bourse, the cry was raised in the
                            crowd “a la Bourse,” and away the people went, breathing vengeance
                            against the moneychangers and speculators who, it was alleged, had taken
                            advantage of the false report to get the benefit of a rise of about four
                            per cent in the stocks. Never were money-changers more summarily driven
                            out of their temple. In a few moments all persons in the Bourse were
                            expelled, some of whom, it is said, were thrown head and heels out of
                            the windows and doors. In a short time, however, about half past three
                            o’clock, the crowd left there, greatly exasperated at having been made
                            victims of so cruel a hoax, and directed themselves towards Place
                            Vendome, halting under the windows of the minister of justice. There
                            they shouted for Emile Ollivier and demanded of him the closing of the
                            Bourse from which the false news had emanated. M. Ollivier responded in
                            a short and well-turned speech, closing by asking them to disperse,
                            which they did. At about five o’clock in the afternoon a group of
                            persons, numbering about three thousand, gathered in front of the
                            ministry of justice and again demanded that M. Ollivier should show
                            himself and make another speech, but the minister refused to do so a
                            second time. The vociferations then increased every instant and hostile
                            cries were raised against the minister by the multitude, who demanded
                            the name of the author of the false news, and reclaimed the liberty of
                            the press. Passing myself through Place Vendome at half-past five
                            o’clock, I saw this turbulant crowd in front of the ministry and stopped
                            to ascertain the cause of it. Soon M. Ollivier made his appearance at
                            the window and commenced a speech, but the tumult, “noise and
                            confusion,” was so great that I could understand but very little from
                            the position where I stood. It was evidently not very satisfactory, for
                            the people did not disperse immediately, as he had requested, but began
                            shouting in favor of the liberty of the press and raising hostile cries
                            against M. Ollivier. The public hold him responsible for the terrible
                            severity of the press law which prevents them from getting any news from
                            the army. It requires everything to <pb n="90" xml:id="pg_90"
                                facs="0124"/>come through official channels, and is given out at
                            such times and in such measure as may suit the purposes of
                            government.</p>
                        <p>In the evening of Saturday Colonel Moore, of this legation, went down
                            town to watch the progress of events. At 10 o’clock he found Place
                            Vendome literally crammed with both men and women, who were in the
                            highest state of excitement, singing a new song called the “Press song,”
                            and raising menacing cries against the minister of justice. Afterward
                            large crowds of people collected in Rue de la Paix, on the Boulevards,
                            and in the Place de la Madeleine, all singing and shouting, evidently in
                            very bad temper. They were, however, restrained from violence by large
                            bodies of troops, who appeared in different parts of the city, and I can
                            hear of no acts of actual violence having been perpetrated.</p>
                        <p>The official journal of yesterday (Sunday) contains a dispatch of two
                            lines, dated at Metz at 11 o’clock the evening before; it simply says:
                            “The corps of General Frossard is in retreat. There are no details.”
                            That was enough to inspire the greatest uneasiness and anxiety. The
                            dispatch gave no indication of where the battle was fought, or what was
                            the extent of the losses, while the great Paris public was tormented
                            with fear and suspense. A proclamation of the Empress and the ministry
                            appeared at noon in the second edition of the official journal. This
                            proclamation contained a bulletin from the Emperor, dated at Metz at
                            half-past 12 o’clock Sunday a. m., announcing that Marshal McMahon had
                            lost a battle, and that General Frossard had been obliged to retreat.
                            Another bulletin from the Emperor, dated at Metz three hours later,
                            announced that his communications with Marshal McMahon were interrupted,
                            and that he had no news of him since the day before; and still another,
                            one hour later, from headquarters at Metz, both of which were also
                            contained in the proclamation to the minister of the interior, gave a
                            very brief account of the battles of McMahon and Frossard, but said that
                            details were wanting. It further stated that the troops were lull of <hi
                                rend="italic">élan</hi>, and that the situation was not compromised,
                            but that the enemy was on French territory, and a serious effort was
                            necessary. Thereupon, the proclamation went on to say that in the
                            presence of the grave news, the duty was clear, and that an appeal was
                            made to the patriotism and energy of all; that therefore:</p>
                        <p>“The chambers are convoked, we will place Paris in a state of defense; to
                            facilitate the execution of military preparation, we declare it in a
                            state of siege.”</p>
                        <p>A decree of the Empress regent convokes the senate and the corps
                            legislatif for Thursday the 11th of August. Another decree by her
                            Majesty places the department of Seine in a state of siege. I
                            immediately telegraphed you as follows:</p>
                        <p rend="right"><hi rend="smallcaps">“Paris,</hi> 7<hi rend="italic">th
                                August</hi>, 1870—4 p. m.</p>
                        <p>“General Frossard’s corps beaten. Marshal McMahon defeated. His
                            communication with Emperor cut off. Paris declared in a state of siege.
                            Legislative bodies convoked for 11th August.”</p>
                        <p>It is difficult to convey to you any adequate idea of the state of
                            feeling which this extraordinary news from the battle-field, to which
                            was added the declaration of the siege of Paris, and the convocation of
                            the corps législatif, has created. Paris has hardly ever seen such a day
                            since the time of the first revolution. The whole people seems paralyzed
                            by the terrible events which have burst upon them in such rapid and
                            fearful succession. The rain that was falling yesterday may have had
                            some influence in keeping the people from the streets, but on <pb n="91"
                                xml:id="pg_91" facs="0125"/>going clown town in the afternoon I
                            found people collected in knots about the Grand Hotel and on the
                            Boulevards, reading the newspapers, and discussing the situation.
                            Afterward I saw large crowds proceeding in the rain toward the ministry
                            of justice, in Place Vendôme, which seems to be the objective point,
                            owing to the hostility which appears to exist against M. Ollivier.</p>
                        <p>By a decree in the official journal of this morning, the time for the
                            meeting of the legislative bodies is changed, and they are to meet
                            tomorrow.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> You did me the honor to inform me, on
                                the 30th ultimo, that a considerable number of German subjects,
                                placed under the semi-official protection of the legation of the
                                United States at Paris, had expressed to you the desire of obtaining
                                from you a sort of certificate, to which they seemed to attach a
                                certain importance as regards their security. You deemed it proper
                                at the same time to forward a draught of this document to me, to be
                                submitted for the approval of my department.</p>
                            <p>I cannot understand, sir, the utility of such a certificate, the
                                possession of which, you will readily perceive, will add in no
                                respect to the security of the German subjects to whom it may be
                                granted, provided their conduct gives no cause for complaint, and
                                which would have no effect in protecting them against the
                                consequences to which they would be exposed by culpable actions.
                                With this reservation, I will add that, in case you should not judge
                                it desirable to refuse a certificate to those Germans who may claim
                                it, I have no objection to make to the form in which you propose to
                                draw it. I am, moreover, this moment in receipt of a notice from the
                                minister of the interior, <pb n="92" xml:id="pg_92" facs="0126"
                                />that all Germans resident in France are required to provide
                                themselves, from competent French authorities, with a permission to
                                remain. This police regulation appears to me to render all the more
                                unnecessary the delivery of a certificate by the legation of the
                                United States.</p>
                            <p>Accept, sir, the assurances, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> In view of the threatened, and, in some
                            cases, the actual, maltreatment of the subjects of the powers now at war
                            with France, I have been concerting measures with Mr. Kern, the Swiss
                            minister, who is charged with the protection of the subjects of Bavaria
                            and Baden, and with Mr. Okouneff, the Russian chargé d’affaires, who is
                            charged with the protection of the subjects of Würtemberg, to secure
                            from the French government that treatment and protection to such of
                            those subjects as find themselves in France at this moment as is due
                            under such circumstances to all subjects of a belligerent power. There
                            are a great many threats, and occasional instances of violence, enough
                            to inspire great terror among the Germans, who are coming in crowds to
                            the legation. In all cases where they are pursued by threats or violence
                            I promise them the protection of the American flag. The recent French
                            defeats have served to embitter still more the feelings of the French
                            against the Germans.</p>
                        <p>The Figaro of the 9th instant, one of the most widely circulated journals
                            of Paris, contained an article demanding the immediate expulsion of all
                            Germans from Paris. It proposed that all Germans who were able to pay
                            their passage should be embarked at Havre in twenty-four hours, and that
                            all those who had not the means of leaving should be put under lock and
                            key, a proposition at once savage and disgraceful. That article, which
                            was so well calculated to inspire terror, was brought to me at noon on
                            the 9th instant. It was the day of the meeting of the corps legislatif,
                            and I immediately repaired thither, with the expectation <pb n="93"
                                xml:id="pg_93" facs="0127"/>of meeting my colleagues, Messrs. Kern
                            and Okouneff, and to consult with, them as to what we should do. I met
                            them both in the diplomatic tribune, but before we left there we saw the
                            ministry displaced and that everything was in confusion. In the state of
                            things that existed my colleagues thought it would be impossible to see
                            any member of the government that night, and that we should have to
                            postpone action till the next morning. I went myself, however, to the
                            foreign office and saw the Count Faverney, the chief of the bureau, and
                            explained to him the situation of things, and asked that the French
                            government should take immediate steps to secure protection to the
                            subjects of those powers who had been placed under my protection with
                            the assent of the government of his Majesty. He said the ministry had
                            gone out and that it was almost impossible to have anything done that
                            night; but, upon my suggestion, he said he would see the prefect of
                            police on the subject.</p>
                        <p>This whole matter having assumed a still graver aspect, my colleagues and
                            myself called yesterday afternoon upon M. Chevereau, the new minister of
                            the interior, to make our representations and see what the French
                            government proposed to do in the premises. Mr. C. was just going to the
                            chamber, and it was impossible for him to give us an audience; but he
                            fixed ten o’clock this morning as the time at which he would see us at
                            the ministry of the interior. On repairing thither we found he had been
                            called away to a meeting of a council, and that he could not have an
                            interview with us until half-past six o’clock this afternoon, and, of
                            course, too late for me to advise you of the result by the dispatch-bag,
                            which leaves to-night. In the mean time the report is rife that a decree
                            is to be made, at once, expelling all Germans from Paris. I cannot,
                            however, think such a thing can be possible; but if so, I shall
                            communicate with you immediately by telegraph.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir: I</hi> have to-day received the dispatch of Mr.
                            Davis, relative to the credit to be placed at my disposition by the
                            Prussian government in aid of their subjects expelled from France. I
                            have also received an authoritative dispatch to the effect that 50,000
                            thalers will be placed to my credit for that purpose. This credit has
                            come none too soon. Five hundred subjects of the North German
                            Confederation have been to the legation to-day to get their passports to
                            leave French territory. Among this number have been many persons of
                            extreme poverty, and whose condition was in every respect most
                            deplorable. Since the breaking out of the war no Germans have been able
                            to get work, and the poorer classes have already exhausted the very
                            little they had in store. They are, therefore, to-day without work,
                            without money, without credit, without friends, without bread. Pinched
                            with hunger, terrified by threats of violence, with no means of leaving
                            the country, they have come to me to save them. Women with little babes
                            in their arms, and women far gone in pregnancy, bathed in tears and
                            filled with anguish, have come to our legation as their last hope. I
                            feel immeasurably thankful that the liberality of the Prussian
                            government has enabled me to afford these poor people some relief. I
                            give each one 30 francs, which is enough to enable them to reach the
                            German frontier, where I have no doubt they will be taken care of. I
                            shall do all in my power to assuage the miseries of these people whose
                            cruel situation must challenge the profoundest sympathy of every
                            generous heart.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I desired to answer sooner the letter
                                which you did me honor to addres me the 25th ultimo, concerning the
                                subjects of the North German Confederation recalled to their
                                country. The necessity of consulting with my colleague, the minister
                                of the interior, whose province it is to organize the numerous
                                details that relate in time of war to the residence of foreigners in
                                France, and especially to that of the subjects of the enemy’s
                                nation, has been the only cause of this delay.</p>
                            <pb n="95" xml:id="pg_95" facs="0129"/>
                            <p>I am to-day able to make known to you the measures taken to assure
                                the execution of the resolutions of the government, of which I
                                notified you the 23d of July; but first permit me to examine briefly
                                the observations so courteously presented in your letter cited
                                above, on the line of conduct that the government of the Emperor has
                                seen fit to adopt under existing circumstances, in relation to a
                                certain class of German subjects resident in our territory at the
                                time of the declaration of war.</p>
                            <p>It is not my intention to sift to the bottom the rights of
                                belligerents toward the enemy’s subjects. The principle itself, in
                                virtue of which the government of the Emperor has acted, is not to
                                the point. You have been pleased to recognize this; but, though
                                admitting that in strict point of view our right is not contestable,
                                it would seem to result from your remarks that the application that
                                we had made of it partakes of those extreme consequences of the
                                right of war which modern ideas and the progress of civilization
                                disavow.</p>
                            <p>We attach too much importance to the preservation of the sympathy of
                                the great republic which you represent, not to try to correct your
                                first impression in demonstrating that nothing in the measures
                                adopted by the government of the Emperor is of a nature to make us
                                incur the responsibility of a disregard of the laws of war, as they
                                are recognized in our days.</p>
                            <p>In ancient law, as well as in ancient custom, the subjects of the
                                enemy residing in the territory were considered as prisoners upon
                                whom could be visited all the consequences of war.</p>
                            <p>According to the modern theory the modification of this state of
                                things consists not in conceding to the subjects of the enemy an
                                absolute right to leave the territory of the belligerent, but to
                                impose upon the latter the duty of not maltreating them if it
                                permits them to remain within its territory, and if they conduct
                                themselves peacefully, or in case the government does not wish to
                                keep them, to accord them a reasonable delay for leaving the
                                country. You refer on this point to the fact that in 1798, that is
                                to say, at a moment when hostilities appeared imminent between
                                France and the United States, it was ordered that the subjects of
                                the enemy who desired to leave the United States were at liberty to
                                do so.</p>
                            <p>This objection has nothing in itself decisive, because what one law
                                has done under certain circumstances, another law can modify, if
                                there is occasion.</p>
                            <p>As to the passage from the celebrated juris-consult, quoted in your
                                letter, I will first observe that Kent, according to the summary of
                                his views, belongs very much more to the class of partisans of the
                                rigorous doctrine; it is sufficient to remind for that in opposition
                                to the greater part of modern writers, who maintain that war
                                constitutes a relation between the respective states alone. Kent
                                differs from this principle, in holding that war is also a relation
                                between individuals, and that war once declared, the subjects of one
                                government immediately become enemies of all the subjects of the
                                others. It can also be said that in the passage reproduced, Kent
                                confines himself to mentioning the opinion of Vattel without giving
                                his own, and in calling attention in the following paragraphs to the
                                fact that the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court of the United
                                States has definitively pronounced itself formally in favor of the
                                most rigorous doctrine. (Vol. I, sec. 59.)</p>
                            <p>The most accredited German authors limit themselves to demand, as an
                                extreme favor of the belligerents, to accord to the unsuspected and
                                peaceful subjects of the enemy authorization to continue to reside
                                on the territory. It is thus that Hefter, professor of the
                                University of Berlin, after having expressed this idea, that the
                                subjects of the enemy should obtain a suitable delay for leaving the
                                territory, adds: “Circumstances, nevertheless, may render necessary
                                their provisional sequestration in order to prevent their making
                                communications and carrying news or arms to the enemy.” (Le Droit
                                International, pp. 226, 240.)</p>
                            <p>Has the government of the Emperor done anything but apply this
                                doctrine in the most moderate manner? Has it gone beyond what the
                                laws of legitimate defense allow? I do not think so; and I am
                                persuaded, sir, that you will share my opinion if you will be
                                pleased to examine in regard to whom and in what cases the measures
                                in question have been taken. First, it has been decided in principle
                                that all Prussian subjects whatever residing in our territory will
                                be permitted to remain there, and there enjoy the protection that
                                our laws grant to all foreigners who respect and submit to them.</p>
                            <p>We had no intention of adopting any other measures as regards the
                                subjects of the enemy, when an incident, the gravity of which could
                                not be mistaken, and to which we could not be blind without wanting
                                in our first duties toward the country of which the defense is
                                confided to us, occurred to awaken the attention of the minister of
                                war.</p>
                            <p>Hardly had war been declared when we saw Prussian subjects, whose age
                                called them to serve in the enemy’s army, gather openly at the
                                railway station, and there, obedient to a word of command, as if
                                there had been a sort of recruitment practiced, prepare to cross the
                                frontier.</p>
                            <p>It was then that the government of the Emperor had to ask itself
                                whether the favors that are consistent with a state of war could go
                                so far as to allow our enemies freely <pb n="96" xml:id="pg_96"
                                    facs="0130"/>to augment their military forces at the moment when
                                the struggle was about to commence, and if there was no means of
                                distinguishing between inoffensive persons and those whom we were
                                liable to meet a few days later in the ranks of the combatants.</p>
                            <p>This distinction has been made as it should be, and we have beside
                                the consciousness of having acted within the limit of our legitimate
                                rights in that which concerns those even to whom the prohibition of
                                exit applies. Nothing is changed from our previous resolution under
                                the head of the security which is accorded to them if their conduct
                                does not furnish motives, based upon complaints, and without our
                                having so far the idea of using against them the odious treatment
                                inflicted upon the French recently expelled from Baden
                                territory.</p>
                            <p>To recapitulate, the following measures have been adopted regarding
                                German subjects:</p>
                            <p>1st. The authorization to leave France will only be accorded
                                individually to those over forty years of age.</p>
                            <p>2d. To those above that age there will be delivered by the minister
                                of the interior a safe-conduct, which will be retained on the
                                frontier by the agent in charge of the surveillance.</p>
                            <p>3d. The safe-conduct being retained on the frontier, will not be
                                submitted to the <hi rend="italic">visa,</hi> of foreign affairs. It
                                is independent of the passports which the legation or the consulates
                                of the United States may think proper to deliver to those
                                interested, and those passports will not be subjected to the <hi
                                    rend="italic">visa</hi> of the ministry of the interior nor of
                                that of foreign affairs.</p>
                            <p>4th. In case a German subject should wish to enter or return to
                                France, the request should be addressed direct to the ministry of
                                foreign affairs, or by the intermediary of the diplomatic
                                agents.</p>
                            <p>Accept the assurance of the high consideration with which I have the
                                honor of being, sir, your very humble and very obedient servant,</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have the honor to acknowledge the
                                receipt of your communication of the 3d instant, in which you inform
                                me of the decision of his Majesty’s government respecting the
                                granting permission to the subjects of the North German
                                Confederation to quit France.</p>
                            <p>As your excellency apprises me of the decision as a definite one, it
                                does not become me to discuss it any longer as an open question; but
                                inasmuch as certain observations of your excellency in regard to the
                                action of the American Government under similar circumstances, and
                                to the opinion of one of its leading publicists upon the points
                                involved in discussion, seem to invite, if not to require, some
                                further notice on my part, I beg leave very briefly to say a few
                                words in reply to those observations. I do so chiefly because I feel
                                confident that my Government will take deep interest in the decision
                                of the question now raised in this discussion, and because I am sure
                                that it will be very desirous that its true position in regard to it
                                should not be misunderstood.</p>
                            <p>Your excellency remarks, in reference to the statute of the United
                                States of the 6th of July, 1798, which I had the honor to cite in
                                order to show its settled practice and policy on this head, that the
                                argument to be derived from it has “nothing decisive in it, because
                                what one statute has ordained under certain circumstances, another
                                statute can modify, if there is occasion so to do.” In reply to this
                                suggestion permit me to call your excellency’s attention to the fact
                                that the law in question has now stood on the statute-book of the
                                United States for more than seventy years; that it has remained
                                untouched and unchanged in the particular in question during the
                                only foreign wars which the United States have had during that time,
                                viz., with Great Britain in 1812, and with Mexico in 1847; and that
                                if the United States were justly committed to that policy in 1798,
                                when it had only a population of 3,000,000, mostly indigenous to the
                                soil, it is now infinitely more pledged to it, when out of its
                                population of 35,000,000 to 40,000,000 so large a population of her
                                citizens are of recent emigration, and when American citizens are to
                                be found outside of her limits in vast multitudes, at any moment
                                that a foreign war might arise. Could your excellency believe that
                                under such circumstances my government would give its assent to a
                                principle, or think for a moment of repealing a law, the effect of
                                which, if imitated by foreign nations, would be that every one of
                                its numerous citizens in foreign parts would be liable to be
                                detained in any hostile country with whom the United States might
                                happen to engage in hostilities, because all such citizens are held
                                liable at home, as is the case, to be called on to do military duty?
                                No! I pray your excellency to consider the statute provision
                                referred to, tested as it has been by a long series of years, and
                                reiterated in sentiment as it has been over and over again in
                                numerous subsequent treaties of the <pb n="97" xml:id="pg_97"
                                    facs="0131"/>United States with other powers, as rather a
                                fundamental, organic element of American policy, than as a passing
                                temporary ordinance which could readily yield to the slightest
                                pressure of a change of circumstances. In this sense I beg to put it
                                upon the same platform as the neutrality statutes of the United
                                States, which have remained essentially the same, notwithstanding
                                numerous grave crises, ever since their first enactment in 1793.</p>
                            <p>Your excellency is pleased to pay the compliment to the distinguished
                                American publicist Kent, whose opinion I took the liberty to cite,
                                to say, that in regard to another passage quoted by me he limits
                                himself to repeating the opinion of another, without expressing his
                                own. In regard to this statute, however, your excellency will
                                observe that he speaks for himself of it, as “dictated by a humane
                                and enlightened policy,” (vol. 1 Commentaries, p. 58;) and I
                                understand him to extend the same comment to English and French laws
                                of the days of Edward III and Henry VIII of England, and the
                                ordinance of Charles V of France, which declared at that early day
                                that “foreign merchants who should be in France at the time of
                                declaration of war shall have nothing to fear, for they should have
                                liberty to depart freely with their effects.”</p>
                            <p>Will your excellency also allow me to make, in regard to the passage
                                wherein you say Chancellor Kent contents himself with citing Vattel
                                without giving his own opinion, that the learned chancellor says
                                (five lines earlier, page 56) in his own person that “such
                                stipulations (as allowing foreign subjects a reasonable time after
                                the war breaks out to recover and dispose of their effects, or to
                                withdraw them) have now become an established <hi rend="italic"
                                    >formula</hi> in commercial treaties.” If this should seem to be
                                limited to the right of the foreigner to withdraw <hi rend="italic"
                                    >his property</hi> only, and not <hi rend="italic">his
                                    person,</hi> I beg to ask if the concession of the lesser
                                privilege does not, <hi rend="italic">a fortiori</hi>, imply that of
                                the greater. How can one be supposed to be able to withdraw his
                                goods and effects [without] withdrawing himself also? Vattel, in the
                                passage immediately following, (as do most of the writers on public
                                law which I have had an opportunity to consult,) puts the two
                                concessions upon the same common coördinate basis. And since your
                                excellency has done me the honor to refer to Vattel in connection
                                with Kent, will you permit me to call your attention to the fact
                                that the American commentator, in quoting Vattel, fails to translate
                                into English the full force of the Swiss publicist’s <hi
                                    rend="italic">dictum,</hi> which I beg leave to characterize as
                                one of the most forcible as well as most accurate expressions of the
                                sentiments which I am trying to express in behalf of my Government
                                that can anywhere be found. With your excellency’s permission, I
                                will quote the whole paragraph from the original French:</p>
                            <p>“Le souverain qui déclare la guerre ne peut retenir les sujets de
                                l’ennemi qui se trouvent dans ses états an moment de la déclaration
                                non plus que leurs effets; ils sont venus chez lui sur la foi
                                publique; en leur permettant d’entrer dans ses terres et d’y
                                séjourner il leur a promis tacitement toute liberté et toute sûreté
                                pour le retour. Il doit donc leur marquer un temps convenable pour
                                se retirer avec leurs effets; et s’ils restent au delà du terme
                                prescrit, il est en droit de les traiter en ennemis, toutefois en
                                ennemis des amis. Mais s’ils sont retenus par un empèchement
                                insurmontable, par une maladie, if faut nécessairement, et par les
                                mêmes raisons leur accorder un juste délai. Loin de manquer à ce
                                devoir aujourd’hui on donne plus encore à l’humanité, et très
                                souvent on accorde aux étrangers, sujets de l’état auquel on a
                                déclaré la guerre, tout le temps de mettre ordre à leurs
                                affaires.”</p>
                            <p>These sentiments lose none of their force when it is remembered that
                                they were uttered more than a century ago.</p>
                            <p>I will only allow myself a single further observation in regard to
                                the judicial decision of the Supreme Court of the United States,
                                upon which your excellency bestows a passing observation. When
                                Chancellor Kent speaks of “the ancient and sterner rule having
                                become definitively settled by the Supreme Court of the United
                                States,” he does not point his comment with his usual accuracy. It
                                was only with reference to the <hi rend="italic">confiscation of
                                    property,</hi> and not the detention of persons, that the
                                American Supreme Court was deciding; and it was only in reference to
                                the formula that the learned chancellor’s comment was pertinent, and
                                what I pray your excellency to observe was that decision. The lower
                                court (the eminent Judge Story) had decided that British property
                                found on American territory during the war of 1812 was rightfully
                                seized and confiscated by the United States Government, but the
                                Supreme Court overruled this decision, and held that enemies’
                                property was not liable to detention without a special statute of
                                the United States Congress to that effect; and I beg your
                                excellency’s attention to the fact that the United States never have
                                passed any such statute of confiscation, <hi rend="italic"
                                    >àpropos</hi> of a foreign war, down to this day; and that,
                                therefore, at the present moment, by the decision of the highest
                                American tribunal, if any such war shall hereafter break out, an
                                enemy’s property will not be liable to confiscation. As for his
                                personal security, I beg leave to say that the belligerent stranger
                                may fall back, with perfect security, upon the law of 1798, above
                                commented on, and, as I believe, with perfect assurance that he will
                                not see its repeal attempted, much less accomplished, whatever may
                                be the pressure of a foreign war.</p>
                            <p>I trust that your excellency will see that in this more extended
                                reply to the communication <pb n="98" xml:id="pg_98" facs="0132"/>of
                                the 3d instant than I intended, I have in view but the single point

                                in the decision which the government of France feels itself
                                constrained by circumstances to adopt in regard to North German

                                of the Eider, with its ports, rivers, harbors, roads, and creeks, is
                                held in a state of effective blockade by the naval forces placed
                                under our command, and that a delay of ten days will be granted to

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> In my dispatch No. 253, and dated the 12th
                            instant, I spoke of an interview which was to be had that evening by Mr.
                            Kern, the Swiss minister, Mr. Okouneff, the Russian chargé d’affaires,
                            and myself, with M. Chevereau, minister of the interior, on the subject
                            of the protection of the subjects of the powers at war with France.</p>
                        <p>I will now endeavor to give you a connected narration of what has taken
                            place in regard to this matter since the date of my dispatch above
                            alluded to.</p>
                        <p>On the 12th instant, at 6.30 p. m., Mr. Kern, Mr. Okouneff, and myself
                            had the interview with the minister of the interior of which I spoke in
                            my dispatch No. 253. Between the time the interview was arranged with M.
                            Chevereau and the time it actually took place the subject of the
                            expulsion of the Germans from Paris had been up in the corps legislatif,
                            and for a full understanding of what was said and done there I send you
                            a translation of the material part of the debate, marked No. 1, as
                            copied from the official journal. I would call your attention to the
                            language made use of in this debate by the minister of the interior, M.
                            Chevereau. He speaks of all measures taken to expel [<hi rend="italic"
                                >expulser</hi>] the foreigners in Paris. I alluded to this for the
                            reason that Mr. Davis had requested in his telegraphic dispatch that the
                            word “<hi rend="italic">departure</hi>” should be substituted for the
                            word “<hi rend="italic">expulsion.</hi>”</p>
                        <p>Calling upon M. Chevereau, at the ministry of the interior, at the
                            appointed hour, Mr. Kern, as being the senior minister here, stated to
                            him the subject upon which we had desired to see him, and explained our
                            positions in the matter. M. Chevereau remarked that when he came into
                            office he found that the preceding ministry had, in view of the
                            circumstances at the time, adopted the policy of refusing to allow
                            Prussians to leave France, and had made certain provisions regulating
                            their residence. The circumstances had, however, changed, and he found
                            himself in the face of regulations which had no longer any “<hi
                                rend="italic">raison d’étre.</hi>” The government had, therefore,
                            determined, with the view of both relieving itself from the presence, in
                            the heart of the capital, of some forty thousand Prussians, and at the
                            same time for the purpose of protecting them from the excited population
                            of Paris, to order them in the most humane mode to leave the country. He
                            was urged to do this in order to answer the interpellations of the corps
                            legislatif and the general expression of public opinion as found in the
                            journals of Paris. After a general conversation as to the effect of such
                            action on the German population, and the hardships and misery which
                            would result therefrom, Mr. C. said he was prepared in every way to
                            mitigate as far as he could the harshness of the order, and that he
                            would take pleasure in making the exceptions as numerous as possible;
                            that any persons who could be recommended by respectable parties in
                            their neighborhood, or who would be indorsed by the legations of Russia,
                            the United States, and Switzerland, he would cheerfully allow to remain
                            unmolested. At the same time, in view of the excited state of the
                            population of Paris, he advised all who could get off to leave at once.
                            He would endeavor to remove all difficulties in the way of departure and
                            to make the formalities as few as possible. At my own suggestion he
                            promised to ascertain from the prefecture of police whether it would be
                            possible to dispense with the police <hi rend="italic">visa</hi> of <pb
                                n="100" xml:id="pg_100" facs="0134"/>that office on the passports of
                            Germans wishing to leave, and, in concert with the prefect, he would
                            devise some expeditious mode by which the Germans could leave France on
                            the simple <hi rend="italic">visa</hi> of the different legations
                            charged with their protection. At my further suggestion, he promised to
                            send immediate orders to the French police agents on the frontier not to
                            molest the Germans who had started to leave the country, even if their
                            papers had not a proper <hi rend="italic">visa.</hi> I then told the
                            minister that I had received very recent information from the American
                            consul at Rheims of the ill-treatment to which the German residents in
                            that vicinity had been subjected. He gave orders that the prefect should
                            be immediately telegraphed to consult with the American consul there,
                            and to afford every protection possible, and also to authorize our
                            consul to give them passes to leave the country. In conclusion, the
                            minister said he should be glad to place himself entirely at the
                            disposition of the representatives of Russia, the United States, and
                            Switzerland, with the view of aiding them in removing the difficulties
                            which he understood must surround, the position of the different peoples
                            under their protection.</p>
                        <p>At quite an early hour the next morning Mr. Erian, one of the under
                            secretaries of the ministry, called at the legation to state that it had
                            been arranged with the police authorities that all of the people under
                            my protection could leave France upon the simple <hi rend="italic"
                                >visa</hi> of my legation, a form of which he gave.</p>
                        <p>As I stated in my dispatch No. 257, under date of the 15th instant, we
                            have been giving these <hi rend="italic">visas</hi> in great numbers, as
                            well as furnishing pecuniary assistance to a smaller number in order to
                            enable them to leave French territory.</p>
                        <p>I had the honor to receive on the 17th instant the telegraphic dispatch
                            of Mr. Davis, containing the approval of my action in suggesting a
                            credit to be placed at my disposition by the Prussian government to aid
                            in removal of their poor from Paris, advising me that such a credit had
                            been given, and instructing me to do what I could, consistent with
                            public law and the position of our country as a neutral, to mitigate the
                            severity of the order of “<hi rend="italic">expulsion.</hi>” I also
                            received, the day after, the telegraphic dispatch submitting the word
                                “<hi rend="italic">departure</hi>” for the word “<hi rend="italic"
                                >expulsion</hi>,” which I have above alluded to.</p>
                        <p>Though I had left nothing undone in respect of the instructions contained
                            in the telegraph dispatch of Mr. Davis above alluded to, I lost no time
                            in seeking an interview with the Prince de la Tour d’Auvergne on the
                            subject. After conversing in relation to some minor matters, I told the
                            prince that the principal object for which I had sought an interview
                            with him had relation to the position in which I found myself as charged
                            with the protection of the subjects of several of the powers with which
                            France was at war. I stated that the sudden determination of the French
                            government in regard to the departure of the Germans from France had
                            taken me by surprise, and I wanted to know if it were not possible for
                            his Majesty’s government to change their determination in that matter. I
                            explained to him the great distress and hardship it inflicted on
                            thousands of peaceable, innocent, and inoffensive men, women, and
                            children of the laboring classes, most of whom were very poor, and who
                            came in great crowds to our legation seeking their passes and the means
                            of getting out of France.</p>
                        <p>The minister remarked in reply that on his way from Vienna he first heard
                            of this matter and had conceived great doubts as to the propriety of the
                            measure, and on his arrival at Paris had so expressed himself to the
                            Empress Regent and to the minister of interior. He had, however, <pb
                                n="101" xml:id="pg_101" facs="0135"/>yielded his first impressions
                            upon the representations made to him by his colleague, the minister of
                            the interior, that this measure, harsh as it was, was dictated by the
                            pressure of circumstances; that the government could not without great
                            concern contemplate the fact of such vast numbers of Prussians
                            (estimated at forty thousand) residing in their midst; and that their
                            apprehensions had become excited by the maneuvers of certain Prussians
                            whose presence in Paris was dangerous in the highest degree; that the
                            French population had reached a state of excitement on the subject of
                            the residence of so many Prussians in the heart of the capital which
                            rendered it unsafe for the latter, and placed the government under the
                            obligation of requiring their departure for their own sake as a measure
                            of humanity, and in view of their protection, that the government was
                            perfectly willing and anxious to mitigate the hardship of their decree
                            by making any exceptions in favor of persons recommended by the
                            respectable citizens of the neighborhood, and especially in favor of any
                            persons that the legation of the United States might designate as worthy
                            of their protection. I remarked in reply to his excellency that Iliad
                            received the same assurance from his colleague, the minister of the
                            interior, who had manifested every disposition to do all in his power to
                            mitigate the severity of the order. I told him that my position had
                            become somewhat embarrassing, and that the difficulties, so far from
                            diminishing, were on the increase; and that out of the mass of the
                            Germans in Paris under my protection it was impossible for me to pass
                            upon the separate cases of those who might desire to remain; and even if
                            I could pass on them, yet by reason of the understanding that the order
                            of departure was general, many unobjectionable persons, who would have
                            been desirous of remaining in Paris and following their ordinary
                            pursuits, considered themselves as being obliged to leave.</p>
                        <p>I said further that in carrying out the wishes and instructions of my
                            government, I wished in the name of humanity to make an earnest appeal
                            to the French government, through him, to revoke the order if it should
                            be considered possible; and if that could not be done, to so modify it
                            as to permit the larger class of Germans in Paris to remain, whose
                            conduct could give no possible cause of complaint to the French
                            government. His excellency then called my attention to the fact that the
                            order of expulsion of all French subjects from Prussia having been
                            issued by the Prussian government, no complaint could, strictly
                            speaking, be made here against the French order, but that out of
                            consideration for my position he was willing to entertain the subject.
                            At the same time he stated that the French order had not been made in
                            consequence of the order of the Prussian government as a retaliatory
                            measure, but for the reasons he had already suggested. I then stated
                            that I was surprised to hear him remark that the Prussian government had
                            made an order of expulsion against French subjects, and was hardly
                            prepared to credit it, unless he had positive knowledge that such was
                            the fact. In confirmation of my belief I stated that I had read a
                            telegraphic dispatch purporting to be an extract from a Berlin paper,
                            which, referring to the expulsion of the Germans from France, expressly
                            declared that the French subjects would not be expelled from Prussia,
                            but would be placed under the protection of the Prussian government. In
                            reply to these suggestions of my own, his excellency stated that he had
                            no official knowledge of the Prussian order of expulsion, but that he
                            understood the minister of interior as stating it as a fact which he had
                            taken for granted in his discussion of the matter with him. He further
                            remarked in this connection that he had personal knowledge of <pb
                                n="102" xml:id="pg_102" facs="0136"/>the arrest and imprisonment,
                            under very aggravating circumstances, of French consular agents, who had
                            sought his protection in Vienna, and whose cases were stamped with
                            peculiar hardships. In concluding the conversation his excellency
                            requested me to address him a written communication embodying my views
                            on the subject, and stating that he would take great pleasure in using
                            his influence to procure them a favorable reception, with a view, if
                            possible, of bringing about some substantial modification of the order.
                            In accordance with such request I addressed his excellency a
                            communication, a copy of which I herewith transmit, marked No. 2.</p>
                        <p>In continuing this narrative of events, I have the honor further to state
                            that the question of the expulsion of the Germans having again been up
                            in the Corps Legislatif on Thursday last, and a report having been made
                            to that body, (which was, however, referred to the minister of the
                            interior,) recommending the expulsion, <hi rend="italic">without
                                exception and without reserve,</hi> of all of the subjects of all
                            the powers at war with France, Mr. Kern and myself sought another
                            interview on the subject with Mr. Chevereau, the minister of the
                            interior, on Friday last. Mr. C. said he was aware that the report had
                            been made to the Chamber, but that the matter was substantially in his
                            own hands, and that there would be no aggravation of the measures which
                            had already been taken. Mr. Kern, for himself, as well as on my behalf,
                            explained to the minister the situation of matters, as then existing, so
                            far as regarded the people with whose protection we were respectively
                            charged, and the afflicting cases of hardship and suffering which we
                            were continually compelled to witness at our legations. M. Chevereau
                            replied that he could fully appreciate all that was said, but that the
                            situation was the result of circumstances which could not be controlled;
                            that the hostility of the people of Paris toward the Prussians had
                            become intense, and that it was a matter of the safety of these people,
                            as well as for other reasons, that they should depart as fast as
                            possible. As a remote possibility the government might have to consider
                            the effect of a siege of Paris, and in that event the city would be
                            defended to the last. In the event of a siege, though scarcely possible,
                            the situation of the Prussians finding themselves here would be
                            deplorable beyond description; and simply as a measure of humanity, he
                            thought they ought to leave at a time when they were able to get away
                            and reach their own country. He expressed his determination to do
                            everything to moderate the hostility of the Parisians toward the
                            Germans, and to have them protected while they remained here. He also
                            reiterated his wish to do everything in his power to facilitate their
                            departure, and to alleviate, as far as possible, the hardships which the
                            state of war had produced in that regard. Mr. Kern and myself both
                            explained to him that it was impossible to make separate applications
                            for those who wanted the permission of the government to remain in
                            Paris, and that when people who came to us to ask our advice on the
                            question, and who represented themselves as peaceable persons, long
                            resident in Paris, and engaged in business which they could not leave
                            without great sacrifices, we had advised them to remain, quietly
                            attending to their affairs and giving no cause of complaint to the
                            government, until they should have special notification to leave, when
                            they should apply to us. Mr. Chevereau fully assented to that course and
                            said there was a large class of such people whom the government had no
                            wish to drive away. In closing the interview, Mr. Kern, in speaking for
                            us both, said that “in making these representations in the name of the
                            interests of the Germans whose protection is confided to us, it is well
                            understood that the governments of <pb n="103" xml:id="pg_103"
                                facs="0137"/>the German States may urge in the future all the rights
                            which might result from the measures taken against their subjects in
                            France.”</p>
                        <p>Such is substantially what has taken place up to this time touching the
                            expulsion of the German population from France. I shall endeavor to keep
                            you fully advised of what may occur in the future.</p>

                            <p>The question of the expulsion of subjects of the powers at war with
                                France came up in the Corps Legislatif, in the sitting of the 12th
                                instant, in the nature of an interpellation by Mr. Terme. I quote
                                from the debate as it appears in the official journal of the 13th
                                instant:</p>

                                interrogate the minister of the interior upon the measure he has
                                taken, or proposes taking, in relation to the foreigners who belong
                                to the powers with which we are in war, and who now reside in
                                France. Grave facts have been signalized. They have caused
                                considerable emotion in France. I ask that this emotion shall be
                                calmed.</p>

                                the government had judged it proper to prevent the Prussians from
                                going out of France, to prevent them from joining the army of the
                                enemy.</p>

                                minister of the interior to explain the word ‘expel,’ which he has
                                used. It would be a serious matter, touching; humanity and
                                civilization, to drive out of France, or even out of Paris, without
                                distinction, all persons belonging to the nations with which we are
                                at war.</p>
                            <p>“M. <hi rend="smallcaps">Eugène Pelletan.</hi> It is evident, from
                                the remarks of the minister of the interior, that the government has
                                committed two mistakes. The first is, not having permitted the
                                Germans to leave when they asked to go. It was a violation of the
                                rights of persons. The second will be to drive them out in the
                                present circumstances, for certainly when foreigners have been
                                placed under the protection of the American and English embassies,
                                you should respect their rights of person, and cause them to be
                                respected. The character of the war is serious enough without
                                seeking to implicate those who have committed no fault.</p>
                            <p>“M. <hi rend="smallcaps">Clement Duvernois,</hi> minister of

                                people.</p>
                            <p>“M. <hi rend="smallcaps">Eugène Pelletan.</hi> If there are Germans
                                at present among us who are conspiring against us, you have
                                something else to do than expel them; you should arraign them before
                                the councils of war; that is what justice requires, and I will say
                                more; while I have the floor to defend the principles of
                                civilization which should be maintained against all attacks, I will
                                ask to put another question to the minister of the interior. There
                                has been posted on all the walls of Paris, and in all the
                                departments of France, a dispatch, found upon the person of a spy. I
                                demand to know what has become of this spy, whether he has been
                                arraigned before a council of war? We have need to know the truth
                                concerning a fact of this nature, as it has been made use of to
                                calumniate a great party whose patriotism is now being shown.</p>
                            <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">The Marquis de Piennes.</hi> The question put
                                by my honorable colleague should be examined in a double sense. The
                                government has the right and the duty to guard against foreigners
                                who abuse the hospitality which they find among us. It is necessary
                                to repress severely such tendencies; but humanity and civilization
                                would repel the measure that would strike without distinction the
                                Germans who have long resided among us, and who, by their industry
                                and labor, have contributed to the grandeur and prosperity of the
                                country.</p>
                            <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">The Minister of the Interior.</hi> I will
                                answer to the honorable M. Pelletan, that it is evident and beyond
                                question that a measure like this should be administered with
                                discrimination, and where the persons are understood to be peaceable
                                citizens as <pb n="104" xml:id="pg_104" facs="0138"/>being so to
                                speak, naturalized by long sojourn, by their habits and family ties,
                                we have not the cruelty to expel them from France. I did not presume
                                it was necessary to say this.</p>
                            <p>“M. E<hi rend="smallcaps">ugéne</hi> P<hi rend="smallcaps"

                                minister of the interior has made. It appeared as though the
                                expulsion <hi rend="italic">en masse</hi> of all the Germans
                                residing in France was about to be made; that would evidently have
                                been a measure contrary to the laws of nations. But if the
                                government intends only to expel dangerous foreigners, there is no
                                disagreement between us.</p>

                            <p>S<hi rend="smallcaps">ir</hi>: In our conversation yesterday you did
                                me the honor to request that I might put in writing the views I
                                expressed to you, verbally, in relation to the departure from France
                                of the subjects of the powers now at war with France.</p>
                            <p>Having been charged by the direction of my own government, and with
                                the consent of the French government, with the protection of the
                                subjects of the confederation of the north, as well as the subjects
                                of Hesse Grand-Ducale, Saxony, and Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, in France,
                                during the war now existing between France and the said powers, I
                                beg leave to state that before any official action had been taken by
                                the French government in relation to the departure from France of
                                the said subjects, my colleagues, Mr. Kern, the minister of
                                Switzerland, charged with the protection of the subjects of Bavaria,
                                and Baden, and Mr. Okouneff, the Russian chargé d’affaires, charged
                                with the protection of the subjects of Wurtemberg, and myself,
                                arranged an interview with M. Chevereau, <hi rend="italic">minister
                                    of the interior, for Friday last</hi>, the 12th instant, with a
                                view of seeking such measures of protection to the Germans in Paris
                                as the situation seemed to require; but that before that interview
                                took place I learned of the proceedings of the Corps Legislatif on
                                that day, and of the declaration of M. Chevereau to the Chamber,
                                that “Depuis avant-hier nous prenons toutes les mesures pour
                                expulser les étrangers qui sont en ce moment dans la capitale.”
                                Therefore, when the interview actually occurred, we found it
                                necessary to address ourselves to the measure of expulsion which had
                                been considered by the Chamber. With courtesy and frankness M.
                                Chevereau explained to us the position of matters touching the
                                Germans in Paris. After stating what had been done and the reasons
                                which had influenced the government, he expressed every desire to
                                ameliorate as far as possible the severity of the situation, and to
                                facilitate, in every way, the departure of the subjects to whom the
                                order was intended to apply. But after the official action taken on
                                this subject had become known, your excellency will not be surprised
                                to learn of the alarm and excitement it produced among the people
                                whose protection had devolved upon me. Their number is very large.
                                In our conversation your excellency estimated it at forty thousand,
                                other people have placed the estimate still higher. The removal of
                                such a population in a few days, even with all ameliorations, could
                                not fail to carry with it an incredible amount of suffering and
                                misery, involving, as it must, the breaking up of homes and the
                                sacrifice and abandonment of property. As to those subjects of the
                                powers at war with France who abuse the hospitality of the country,
                                and who remain in it to become spies, to plot against the
                                government, to stir up sedition and to trouble the public peace
                                generally, all men will be in accord with the government in
                                punishing them and in expelling them from French territory. But
                                their number must be small as compared with the whole number of
                                Germans finding themselves now in Paris. From my observation the
                                great number seem to be composed (independently of the active
                                business men with large affairs) of honest, industrious, laboring
                                men and women, who have come into the country under the sanction of
                                public faith, relying upon the hospitality and protection of the
                                government. They are for the most part engaged in daily toil for the
                                support of themselves and their families, taking no interest in
                                political affairs and many of them quite ignorant of the ordinary
                                passing events. It is upon this class of people that the action of
                                the government falls with peculiar severity. The scenes I am
                                compelled daily to witness are afflicting. My legation and the
                                surrounding streets are filled every day with crowds of these
                                people, who come to procure their passes and to beg some aid (which
                                I have been authorized to extend in certain cases) to enable them to
                                conform to what they understand to be the direction of the
                                government and to leave the country. Under these circumstances,
                                therefore, I feel that I should fail to discharge the full measure
                                of the duty devolving upon me in this regard, and that I should be
                                forgetful of the obligations of humanity did I not make the
                                strongest appeal to the government of his Majesty, through your
                                excellency to further consider this question, and to ask that if it
                                be not possible to suspend action altogether, that there may be at
                                least some modification of the measures <pb n="105" xml:id="pg_105"
                                    facs="0139"/>already taken so as to permit such subjects of the
                                belligerent powers as are under my protection, who are now in
                                France, to remain in the country so long as their conduct shall give
                                no cause of complaint, and further to ask for them that protection
                                which the law of nations accords to unarmed enemies. In making this
                                appeal I but obey the wishes of my government, which has instructed
                                me to do everything which is consistent with the position of my
                                country as a neutral, and with the law of nations, to alleviate the
                                condition of things now existing as regards these people with whose
                                protection I have been charged.</p>

                            <p>“At the request of Count Bernstorff, the North German representative
                                here, I send you the following message received by him from Count
                                Bismarck this morning.”</p>
                            <p>“‘Please say to the American minister, Mr. Washburne, in Paris: A man
                                carrying a flag of truce, who arrived at the French outposts,
                                accompanied by the ordinary trumpeter, in order to invite a proposal
                                from surgeons in the interest of French wounded, was fired on, on
                                the 19th instant, by all the French advance guards he met, so that
                                he was obliged to return after his trumpeter had been severely
                                wounded. We protest against this breach of international law, and
                                will hold France responsible for the fate of the French wounded, for
                                whom our medical help proves insufficient.’</p>
                            <p>“Count Bismarck says to Count Bernstorff:</p>
                            <p>“‘I request you to say further to the American minister, Mr.
                                Washburne, at Paris, that, according to the experience we have
                                hitherto had, the medical staff of the imperial French troops does
                                not wear the badge provided by the convention of Geneva, and that
                                those badges when worn by our medical men are not respected by the
                                French troops, so that constantly at the places for bandaging the
                                surgeons and wounded are shot at. As the manner in which our men
                                carrying flags of truce are treated, contrary to international law,
                                prevents us from sending our complaints in the direct way, we have
                                no other means than to request, herewith, the American minister to
                                state at Paris our formal protest against a breach of that
                                international convention.’”</p>

                                you by Mr. Motley, at the request of Comte de Bernstorff,
                                representative of the North German Confederation at London, which
                                has for its object to bring to the knowledge of the government of
                                the Emperor the reclamations of Count Bismarck against the treatment
                                on the part of our troops, which may have been inflicted on flags of
                                truce, ambulances, surgeons, and wounded.</p>
                            <p>The statements made in this telegram are too contrary to the
                                traditions of the French army to make it possible for me to accept
                                them as exact. I have this day made them known to the minister of
                                war, and will hasten to communicate to you the explanations which he
                                will not fail to give me, and which will, I doubt not, reduce to
                                their just value the protestations of the Prussian government.</p>
                            <p>Receive, sir, the assurances of the high consideration with which I
                                have the honor to be your very humble and obedient servant,</p>

                            to war news, and the greatest uneasiness begins to prevail among the
                            Americans finding themselves at the present time in Paris. Large numbers
                            are leaving, not knowing what may take place. The proclamation of the
                            governor of Paris, only placarded last night, and which I send herewith,
                            has added to the excitement already existing. Our crowd of Germans had
                            considerably decreased yesterday, but it is largely increased to-day on
                            account of the proclamation of General Trochu.</p>
                        <p>I have not telegraphed you any news for several days, for I have had

                                December, 1811, relating to the organization and service of the
                                local staff, which decrees: That in every place, in a state of
                                siege, if the minister or the general of the army gives the orders,
                                or if the troops of the enemy approach within three days’ march of
                                the place, the governor or commanding officer is forthwith, and
                                without awaiting the state of siege, invested with the necessary

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The decree of General Trochu, governor of
                            Paris, which I have the honor to send herewith, marked No. 1, appeared
                            this morning in the official journal, and was placarded over the city
                            last night. Being so sweeping in its terms and so emphatic in its
                            declarations, it of course created a very great degree of excitement
                            among the large number of Germans yet remaining in Paris. The legation
                            was besieged at an early hour by a large crowd of Germans, and although
                            I had employed as many men as could work, yet the number was nearly as
                            great at night as it was in the morning. I felt it my duty to call and
                            address myself to the Prince de la Tour d’Auvergne in regard to both
                            articles of the decree; the first in regard to the very limited time
                            allowed for departure, and the second in relation to the application for
                            the special permission for “<hi rend="italic">séjour</hi>” in Paris. In
                            this matter I should state that I acted in concert with Mr. Kern, the
                            Swiss minister, protecting the Bavarians and the Badois, a diplomat of
                            wisdom, experience, and energy. We saw the minister of foreign affairs
                            separately, and who explained matters to each of us in the same way, but
                            referring us to the minister of the interior, who was more particularly
                            charged with the subject. Accordingly Mr. Kern and myself called on Mr.
                            Chevereau at 7 o’clock this evening. In the first place we called his
                            attention to the short time allowed to the Germans to leave Paris, and
                            that even if they were ready to go, it would be utterly impossible for
                            us to furnish them with the requisite papers. In reply, Mr. Chevereau
                            said that although three days was the time named in the proclamation,
                            yet no advantage would be taken of those who were unable to get away
                            within that time.</p>
                        <p>In the second place, in regard to the permission to be obtained for a
                            sojourn in Paris, we explained to him that we could not, in our
                            diplomatic capacity, make any application whatever to General Trochu,
                            and that our dealings must be with the civil authorities; that if the
                            terms of the proclamation were to be adhered to, we should be powerless
                            to render any aid to the parties with whose protection we had been
                            charged. I explained particularly to Mr. Chevereau the very large number
                            of Germans under my protection who had lived for a long series of years
                            in Paris, and had vast interests at stake; that many of those persons
                            were connected in business with American citizens, and to compel them
                            all to leave would be an incredible hardship, and would entail immense
                            sacrifices. The minister replied very promptly that that question had
                            been just considered by the government, and that our applications could
                            be addressed to the prefect of the police, who had been charged
                            specially with the whole business. He told us to make applications for
                            whoever we pleased, and that they would be considered without any delay,
                            and that whenever we submitted an application of any party for
                            permission to remain in Paris we might consider it as granted unless we
                            had special notice of its rejection.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to send you further a notice which appears in this
                            morning’s “Journal Officiel,” and marked No. 2. It is an invitation to
                            all persons in Paris who are not in a condition “<hi rend="italic">de
                                faire face à l’ennemi</hi>” to leave Paris. In my interview to-day
                            with the Prince de la Tour d’Auvergne I asked him about this notice. He
                            replied that while it was not to be construed as an <hi rend="italic"
                                >order</hi> which would oblige Americans to <pb n="108"
                                xml:id="pg_108" facs="0142"/>leave, yet under existing circumstances
                            he thought it would be well for me to recommend my countrymen to get
                            away as soon as they could, in their own interests. Everything shows
                            that the French government look upon a siege of Paris as probable, for
                            it is making the most stupendous preparation in that direction. I have
                            telegraphed you to that effect to-day in cipher, and also, looking to
                            possibilities, I suggested whether you should not ask the Prussian
                            government to protect Amercan property in Paris, in the event its army
                            reached here. I need not tell you there is a very large amount of
                            property owned by Americans in Paris, and I hope it will be respected by
                            both sides as property of neutrals.</p>

                                under the care of the administration. They increase every day. The

                                to provide themselves in advance, according to the measure of their

                                costume; the red cross on the arm is only to be discerned at a short
                                distance, and can at every moment be removed and replaced; so that
                                it becomes impossible for our troops to know the persons from whom
                                they may expect hostilities and at whom they have to shoot. If
                                persons who are not always, and at the necessary distance,
                                recognizable as soldiers, kill or wound German soldiers, we can only
                                have them tried by a court-martial.</p>

                            <p>Please announce once more to Mr. Washburne that Captain Rochous, who
                                was sent by General Alvensleben to Toul with a flag of truce, has
                                been repulsed by successive shots, and that a trumpeter
                                accompanying, yesterday, another flag of truce to Verdun has been
                                killed. We protest solemnly against these repeated violations of
                                international law, and declare that we shall be henceforth in the
                                impossibility of sending flags of truce to the French army.</p>

                            <p>Will you kindly let the following be known to Mr. Washburne, which
                                only now comes to my knowledge.</p>
                            <p>On the 15th instant General Von Bothmer sent Captain Hanfstangel with
                                a flag of truce to the commandant of the Fortress Mucal. The
                                surrender of the fortress was refused. Before the captain was out of
                                shot’s range he was shot at from the fortress, and was severely
                                wounded. This is the fourth case of breach of international law
                                coming to our knowledge.</p>

                        <p>The greater part of the German population has left the city.</p>
                        <p>This legation has visaed passports and given safe-conducts for very
                            nearly thirty thousand persons, subjects of the North German
                            Confederation, expelled from France. We have given railroad tickets to
                            the Prussian frontier for eight thousand of these people, as well as
                            small amounts of money to a much smaller number. From this statement you
                            can form somewhat of an estimate of the amount of labor we have
                            performed for the last few weeks, and the extra force I have had to
                            employ to accomplish it. I shall, however, have the honor of writing you
                            more fully on this subject at a future time.</p>
                        <p>My time is now a good deal taken up in looking after Germans who have
                            been arrested and thrown into prison. The number is very great. My
                            applications are promptly attended to, and thus far every man has been
                            released, for whom I have applied.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Since I had the honor of addressing you my
                            last dispatch, No. 275, events have marched with gigantic strides. The
                            news of the full extent of the catastrophe which befell the army of
                            McMahon was not made public in Paris until about midnight on Saturday
                            night last, though Palikao had, during the evening in the Chamber, given
                            out news enough to prepare the people for almost anything.</p>
                        <p>In view of the emergency which had arisen, a session of the Corps
                            Législatif was called for midnight on Saturday night, but the president
                            did not take his chair until 1 o’clock on Sunday morning. The sitting is
                            represented as having been solemn and agitated. M. Schneider came into
                            the chamber without the beating of the drum, which ordinarily announces
                            his entry. The silence was deathlike; but few of the deputies of the
                            right were in their seats, though the members of the left were almost
                            all present. The floor was assigned to M. Palikao, the minister of war,
                            who said that, in the presence of the serious news which had been
                            received, he deemed it better not to take any action at that time, but
                            to postpone everything until 12 o’clock of that day, (it was now Sunday
                            morning.) Jules Favre then rose and said that he should not propose any
                            serious opposition to that motion, but he would ask leave to give notice
                            of a proposition which he had to submit, and which he would discuss at
                            the meeting at 12 o’clock. The proposition was as follows:</p>
                        <p>1. Louis Napoleon Bonaparte and his dynasty are declared fallen from the
                            powers which the constitution had confided to them.</p>
                        <p>2. There shall be named by the legislative body a commission vested with
                            powers and composed of * * * * *. You will designate yourselves the
                            number of members who shall compose this commission, who will make it
                            their first duty to repel the invasion and drive the enemy from the
                            territory.</p>
                        <p>3. M. Trochu shall be maintained in his functions of governor general of
                            the city of Paris.</p>
                        <p>After a session of ten minutes only the Chamber adjourned.</p>
                        <p>As this sitting of Sunday was likely to become historic, I went early to
                            the Chamber. I found but a few troops stationed in the neighborhood, and
                            there was not a large number of people in the vicinity. Indeed, I was
                            quite surprised at the tranquillity which seemed everywhere to reign in
                            the quarter of the Palais Bourbon, which is the name of the building
                            occupied by the Corps Législatif. Taking my seat in the diplomatic
                            tribune at quarter before 12, there was not a single person in the hall
                            of the deputies, though the galleries were all well filled. Instead of
                            the session opening at noon, it was precisely 1 o’clock when M.
                            Schneider entered and took the chair of the presidency. The deputies
                            then came rapidly into the hall. Count Palikao was the first of the
                            ministers to come in, and he was soon followed by the Prince de la Tour
                            d’Auvergne, Chevereau, and Brame; all the other ministers took their
                            places on the ministerial benches soon after. The members of the left
                            came in almost simultaneously, Gambetta hurrying along among the first,
                            haggard with excitement. The venerable Raspail takes his seat.
                            Garnier-Pagès hurries across the area in front of the president’s chair
                            in a state of intense agitation. Arago, Simon, Picard, Perry,
                            Estanchin-Guyot, and Montpayroux enter and take their seats. Thiers, the
                            little brisk and vigorous old man walks gently to his place. Jules
                            Favre, the <pb n="113" xml:id="pg_113" facs="0147"/>foremost man of them
                            all, is among the last to enter. In the storm that is raging around him
                            he seems cool and calm and collected. Taking his seat, he covers his
                            face with his hands and seems unconscious of that which is transpiring.
                            And now the president sits in his chair without calling the chamber to
                            order, the members become impatient and clamorous; there is loud talk
                            and violent gesticulation. At precisely twenty minutes after 1 o’clock
                            M. Schneider swings his bell, and the gruff voice of the huissier is
                            heard above the din, “<hi rend="italic">Silence</hi>, <hi rend="italic"
                                >messieurs! s’il vous plaît.</hi>” After some unimportant
                            proceedings the floor is assigned to M. Palikao, the minister of war,
                            who proposes the following project of law:</p>
                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Art.</hi> 1. A council of government and of national
                            defense is instituted. This council is composed of five members. Each
                            member of this council is named by the absolute majority of the Corps
                            Législatif.</p>
                        <p>2. The ministers are named under the countersign of the members of this
                            council.</p>
                        <p>3. The General Count Palikao is named lieutenant general of this
                            council.</p>
                        <p>Done in a council of ministers the 4th of September, 1870.</p>
                        <p>For the Emperor, and in virtue of the powers which he has confided to
                            us.</p>
                        <p rend="right">EUGÉNIE.</p>
                        <p>M. Thiers then submitted another proposition, as follows:</p>
                        <p>Considering the circumstances, the Chamber names a commission of
                            government and national defense. A “Constituante” will be convoked as
                            soon as the circumstances will allow.</p>
                        <p>The proposition of Favre being already before the Chamber, “urgency” was
                            voted on these three propositions, and they were sent to a committee for
                            examination under the rules of the Chamber. At 1.40 o’clock the sitting
                            was suspended to await the report of the committee, and all the members
                            immediately left the hall. As it was supposed that the sitting would not
                            be resumed for an hour or more, I left the diplomatic gallery and
                            descended into the court of the building facing upon the street which
                            runs parallel with the Seine. Here I found a good many people who had
                            been admitted by virtue of tickets. The street in front of the building
                            had been kept quite clear by the military, though there was an enormous
                            multitude of the National Guard and the people on the Place de la
                            Concorde, on the opposite side of the river. The Pont de la Concorde
                            seemed to be sufficiently guarded by the military to prevent their
                            crossing over. All at once I saw quite a number of people on the steps
                            of the Palais Bourbon, and soon they commenced to raise loud cries of
                                “<hi rend="italic">Vive la République!</hi>” “<hi rend="italic"
                                >Déchéance!</hi>” “<hi rend="italic">Vive la France!</hi>” At this
                            moment I was called away by the messenger of the legation, who brought
                            me an urgent message from Madame McMahon, who wanted a safe-conduct from
                            me, to enable her to pass the Prussian lines to visit her wounded
                            husband at Sedan. In company with Mr. Eustis, I stepped into an
                            antechamber to prepare the proper document, and had but just taken my
                            seat at a table to write, when the cry was raised that the people had
                            invaded the building. It seemed but a moment before they were passing
                            into the part where I was. It being impossible to finish the requisite
                            paper, under these circumstances, Mr. Eustis and myself made our way
                            into the court-yard. There was presented a most extraordinary spectacle.
                            A part of a regiment of the line had been brought hurriedly into the
                            yard, had formed across it, and were loading their muskets. Behind them
                            and in the street, and rushing through the gates and up the front steps
                            of the building, was a vast mass of excited people and the National
                            Guard, who had fraternized—the guards having their muskets butt-end
                            upward as a token of friendship. There was evidently collusion between
                            the people who were on the steps of the <pb n="114" xml:id="pg_114"
                                facs="0148"/>Palais Bourbon and the people and National Guards in
                            the Place de la Concorde, on the other side of the river, for it was
                            upon the signal of the people on the steps that the guard and the people
                            broke through the military force that was holding the bridge. As the
                            crowd mounted the steps of the Palais Bourbon it was received with
                            terrific cheers and with shouts of “Vive la république!” and
                            “Déchéance!”</p>
                        <p>Making our way into the street, Mr. Eustis and myself managed to pass
                            through the crowd and to reach the building of the Agricultural Club, in
                            the immediate neighborhood, and from the balcony of which we could see
                            all that was going on. And now the soldiers of the guard, many of them
                            with their hats on the ends of their muskets, accompanied by an
                            indiscriminate mass of men, women, and children, poured over the Pont de
                            la Concorde and filled the entire space, all, in one grand
                            fraternization, singing the Marseillaise and shouting, “Vive la
                            république!” The Municipal Guard, with its shining helmets and brilliant
                            uniforms, was forced back, inch by inch, before the people, until,
                            finally, all military authority became utterly powerless. During this
                            time the National Guard and the people had invaded the Hall of the
                            Deputies, which they found vacant. M. Schneider and about a dozen of the
                            members rushed in. The president in vain made appeals for order, and
                            finally covered himself by putting on his hat; according to immemorable
                            usage of the French assemblies under such circumstances. Gambetta
                            addressed a few energetic words to the invaders, and, a little order
                            being restored, quite a number of deputies entered the hall. But at
                            three o’clock irruption into the Chamber took place. Jules Favre then
                            ascended the tribune and was listened to for a moment. “Let there be no
                            scenes of violence,” he said; “let us reserve our arms for the enemy,
                            and fight to the last; at this moment union is necessary, and for that
                            reason we do not proclaim the republic.” The president now left his
                            seat, and, as it turns out, for the last time. The irruption into the
                            Chamber continued. The floor and the seats of the deputies, on which a
                            few members of the left only remained, were filled with a motley crowd
                            in blouses and in coarse woolen shirts, or in the uniform of the
                            National Guard or the Guard Mobile. They wore caps and kepis of all
                            colors and shapes, and carried muskets with their muzzles ornamented
                            with sprigs of green leaves. The tumult became indescribable, and some
                            of the invaders seized on the pens and paper of the deputies and
                            commenced writing letters; while different persons were going up to the
                            president’s chair and ringing his bell continually. The crowd in the
                            hall now demanded <hi rend="italic">déchéance</hi> of the Emperor, which
                            was declared, and then it was proposed to go to the Hotel de Ville and
                            proclaim the republic. The cry was therefore raised, “À l’Hotel de
                            Ville,” mingled with other cries, “Cherchez Rochefort,” &amp;c., and
                            then this vast multitude commenced moving away from the Palais
                            Bourbon.</p>
                        <p>The crowd having soon sufficiently dispersed, we were enabled to make our
                            way back again to the Corps Législatif, and to enter again the
                            diplomatic tribune. The hall was filled with dust, and a rough-looking
                            man was in the president’s chair, surrounded by a number of men still
                            more rough in appearance. The soldiers and the people were occupying the
                            seats of the deputies, writing letters, looking over documents, and
                            talking and laughing, all in the best humor. In the hall at this time I
                            recognized Garnier-Pagès, Raspail, and a few other members of the
                            left.</p>
                        <p>Leaving the Chamber, we went at once to the Hotel de Ville. The number of
                            the people assembled there was enormous, and the same fraternization
                            existed between them and the National Guard as elsewhere. <pb n="115"
                                xml:id="pg_115" facs="0149"/>The building had been invaded by the
                            people, and all the windows fronting on the square were filled with
                            rough and dirty-looking men and boys. Soon a terrific shout went up;
                            Rochefort was being drawn in a cab by the multitude through the crowd.
                            He was ghastly pale; he stood up in the vehicle, covered with sashes of
                            red, white, and blue, and waving his hat in answer to the acclamations.
                            As he was hauled slowly through the multitude to the main door of the
                            Hotel de Ville, the delirium seemed to have reached its height, and such
                            frantic acclamations I never before heard. At precisely four o’clock and
                            forty-five minutes in the afternoon, by the great clock in the tower of
                            the Hotel de Ville, at one of the windows appeared Gambetta; a little
                            behind him stood Jules Favre and Emanuel Arajo; and then and there, on
                            that historic spot, Gambetta proclaimed the republic.</p>
                        <p>This proclamation was received by every possible demonstration of
                            enthusiasm. Lists were then thrown out of the window containing the
                            names of the members of the provisional government. Ten minutes
                            afterward Raspail and Rochefort appeared at another window and embraced
                            each other, while the crowd loudly applauded them. During this time the
                            public were occupying the Tuileries. Sixty thousand human beings had
                            rolled toward the palace, completely leveling all obstacles; the
                            vestibule was invaded, and in the court-yard, on the side of the Palace
                            de Carousel, were to be seen soldiers of every arm, who, in the presence
                            of the people, removed the cartridges from their guns, and who were
                            greeted by cries, “Long live the nation!” “Down with the Bonapartes!”
                            “To Berlin!” &amp;c. During all this time there was no pillage, no
                            havoc, no destruction of property, and the crowd soon retired, leaving
                            the palace under the protection of the National Guard. At the Hotel de
                            Ville some little damage was done, but nothing to any great extent. Some
                            discussion was raised about the changing of the flag, but Gambetta
                            declared that the tri-color was the flag of 1792 and ‘93, and that under
                            it France had been and would yet be led to victory.</p>
                        <p>From the Hotel de Ville we went back to the Chamber of Deputies, to find
                            it still in possession of the people. From there I returned to my
                            legation, which I reached at 6.30 o’clock. At 8 o’clock I returned to
                            the Corps Législatif, but on my arrival there I found everything closed
                            and the lights extinguished. The doors leading to the hall of the
                            Deputies had been shut, and seals put upon them. I then drove through
                            some parts of the city, and found everything remarkably quiet. The day
                            had been pleasant, and the night was beautiful beyond description. After
                            making a call upon Lord Lyons, I returned to my lodgings to ponder over
                            the events of the day to become memorable in history. In a few brief
                            hours of a Sabbath day I had seen a dynasty fall and a republic
                            proclaimed, and all without the shedding of one drop of blood.</p>

                        <p>I telegraphed you of the results and condition of things here on Monday,
                            and asked for instructions, though not doubting what would be <pb
                                n="116" xml:id="pg_116" facs="0150"/>the prompt action of our
                            Government. I received replies from Mr. Davis Wednesday morning. It was
                            only Tuesday night that I received the official notice from M. Jules
                            Favre of the change of the government, and advising me that the
                            department of foreign affairs had been confided to him. The next morning
                            (Wednesday) I sent a verbal message to the Foreign Office to ascertain
                            when it would be agreeable for the minister to receive me, as I had an
                            important communication to make from my Government. I received a reply
                            that the minister would see me at any time between 2 and 6 o’clock in
                            the afternoon. In the mean time I prepared the letter to M. Jules Favre
                            which I send herewith, marked No. 1, and at 2.30 p. m., accompanied by
                            the first secretary of legation, Colonel Wickham Hoffman, I took it in
                            person to him. He received us with the utmost cordiality. After reading
                            my letter he shook me very warmly by the hand, and thanked me for the
                            communication, saying he would be very glad if I would telegraph to my
                            Government to express his gratitude and profound emotions. He then
                            briefly explained the situation in which the government of the national
                            defense found itself. He said that he was aware that the United States
                            had hitherto refrained from taking any part whatever in the
                            complications of European governments; however, he did not know, but,
                            under present circumstances, it might feel like tendering its good
                            offices, and he wished to know if I should feel myself at liberty to
                            take any action in that direction. I replied that I should not feel
                            authorized to act in so grave a crisis without instructions from my
                            Government, particularly as I could advise with it on the subject by
                            telegraph. On my return to the legation I telegraphed to you as follows,
                            part of the dispatch being in cipher:</p>
                        <p rend="right"><hi rend="smallcaps">Paris,</hi>
                            <hi rend="italic">September</hi> 7, 1870.</p>
                        <p>Have recognized republic. Favre expressed gratitude and profound emotion.
                            Requests United States to join other powers in intervention for peace.
                            Hopes I may be instructed immediately.</p>
                        <p>About 2 o’clock p. m. yesterday M. Jules Favre called upon me in person
                            to thank my Government in the name of that of the national defense, as
                            well as in his own behalf, for its prompt recognition of the republic
                            and the tender of its felicitations. He again desired that I should
                            transmit to the President and Cabinet at Washington the profound
                            acknowledgments of the government of the national defense. I then
                            communicated the dispatch of Mr. Davis in relation to his conversation
                            with M. Berthemy, which I had just received. M. Favre smiled at the
                            allusion to the attempt of the Emperor to found a monarchy on the
                            southern borders, and replied that nothing could be more satisfactory
                            than Mr. Davis’s telegram; it was all they could desire. He then said he
                            had answered my letter of the day before, and that it could be sent to
                            me in the course of the afternoon. It was duly received, and I have the
                            honor to send herewith a copy of if in the original French, together
                            with a translation thereof.</p>

                                the national defense has, by a resolution of its members, confided
                                to you the department of foreign affairs.</p>

                            <p>It affords me great pleasure to advise you that I have this morning
                                received a telegraphic dispatch from my Government instructing me to

                            <p>I am, therefore, ready to put myself in communication with that

                                business as may properly appertain to the functions with which I am
                                charged.</p>
                            <p>In making this communication to your excellency I beg to tender to

                                accomplished without the shedding of one drop of blood, and they

                                the French people and to mankind.</p>
                            <p>Enjoying the untold and immeasurable blessings of a republican form
                                of government for nearly a century, the people of the United States
                                can but regard with profoundest interest the efforts of the French
                                people, to whom they are bound by the ties of a traditional
                                friendship, to obtain such free institutions as will become to them
                                and to their posterity the inalienable rights of “life, liberty, and
                                the pursuit of happiness.”</p>
                            <p>In conclusion, I desire to say to your excellency that I congratulate
                                myself that I am to hold relations with the government of the

                                liberty and free government.</p>
                            <p>I take this occasion to assure your excellency that I have the honor
                                to be, with great respect, your obedient servant,</p>

                                support the recognition of the Government of the United States. No
                                one can better remind us in words, both just and noble, of the
                                inappreciable benefits of a republican government than the
                                representative of a people which has given to the world the salutary
                                example of absolute liberty.</p>
                            <p>You have founded your wise and powerful institutions upon
                                independence and upon civic virtue, and notwithstanding the terrible
                                trials sustained by you, you have preserved with an unshaken
                                firmness your faith in that grand principle of liberty, from which
                                naturally spring dignity, morality, and prosperity.</p>
                            <p>Nations, masters of their own destinies, should strive to follow in
                                your footsteps. They cannot be truly free unless they are devoted,
                                fearless, moderate; taking for their watchword the love of labor and
                                respect for the right of all. This is the programme of the new-born
                                government of France, springing from the painful crisis provoked by
                                the follies of despotism, but at the hour of its birth it can have
                                no other thought than to save the country from the enemy. Here, too,
                                it meets the example of your courage and your perseverance.</p>
                            <p>You have sustained a gigantic contest, and you have conquered. Strong
                                in the justice of our cause, rejecting all lust of conquest,
                                desiring only our independence and our liberty, we have firm hope of
                                success. In the accomplishment of this task we count on the aid of
                                all men of heart, and of all governments interested in the triumph
                                of peace. The adhesion of the Cabinet of Washington would alone give
                                us this confidence. The members of the government beg me to
                                communicate to you all their gratitude for it, and to request you to
                                transmit its expression to your Government.</p>
                            <p>For my part I am happy and proud that fortune has permitted me to be
                                the link of union between two peoples bound together by so many
                                glorious memories, and henceforward by so many noble hopes, and I
                                thank you for having, with so great kindness toward myself,
                                expressed all which I feel toward you, as well as my desire to
                                strengthen more and more the relations of affectionate esteem which
                                should unite us forever.</p>
                            <p>Accept the assurances of the high consideration with which I have the
                                honor to be, sir, your humble and obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> At about 4 o’clock yesterday afternoon a
                            large crow of French people came to the legation, bearing the French and
                            American flags, repeating the cries, “Vive l’Amérique!” “Vive la
                            France!” A delegation, composed of very respectable gentlemen, waited
                            upon me in my private room and read a short address, begging that I
                            would transmit to my Government the thanks of a great number of French
                            citizens for the promptness and cordiality with which it had recognized
                            the French republic. I beg to transmit you a copy of the address to me

                            <p>We come in the name of a large number of French citizens, certain
                                that we shall be approved and followed by the whole nation, to beg
                                you to present our thanks to your Government for the spontaneity
                                with which it answered to the notification of our French republic.
                                To you, sir, reverts a large part of our thanks for the gracious
                                words which your heart dictated in communicating to us the
                                recognition by your Government. The French people will long remember
                                the excellent words of the American minister. We did not expect less
                                of this great and generous nation, whose aspirations and principles
                                have always been in communion with the ideas of France. America and
                                France are sisters, sisters as republics, that is to say, sisters in
                                liberty. The ocean which separates us is less deep than the
                                sentiments which unite us.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Gentlemen:</hi> On behalf of my Government I
                                thank you for this demonstration. I shall take pleasure in
                                transmitting the thanks which you have so eloquently expressed for
                                the action which the Government of the United States has taken in
                                recognizing the new republic of France. In my communication, to
                                which you so kindly allude, I only expressed the sentiments of the
                                President and of the people of the United States. The American
                                people feel the greatest interest in the grand movement which has
                                just been inaugurated in France, and will indulge in the most
                                fervent wishes for its success, and for the happiness and prosperity
                                of the French people. Living themselves under a republican form of
                                government, they know how to appreciate its blessings, and to-day,
                                with warm hearts and eloquent words, they felicitate their ancient
                                ally in the accomplishment of that peaceful and bloodless revolution
                                which must challenge the profound interest of all lovers of liberty
                                throughout the world.</p>

                                the government of the national defense, we have ourselves defined
                                our mission. Power lay prostrate; that which commenced by an attempt
                                finished by a desertion. We have only picked up the government which
                                escaped from impotent hands. But Europe needs to be enlightened; she
                                needs to know, by irrefutable proof, that the country is with us.
                                The invader must encounter upon his route not only the obstacle of
                                an immense city resolved to perish rather than surrender, but a
                                whole people, moreover, organized, represented, an assembly, in

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> Late on Sunday evening last a gentleman,
                            having intimate relations with the government of the national defense,
                            called upon me at my residence to know if I would not unofficially, and
                            simply as a private individual, put myself in communication with the
                            Prussian government, for the purpose of ascertaining its views in regard
                            to peace. I told him I did not see how I could draw a line of
                            demarcation between my <hi rend="italic">unofficial</hi> and <hi
                                rend="italic">official</hi> character in a matter of that kind, and
                            that I would <pb n="120" xml:id="pg_120" facs="0154"/>not presume to
                            take a step of that importance without instructions from my Government.
                            I said to him further, however, that if the government here would
                            intimate its wishes in that respect, I would put myself at once in
                            telegraphic communication with you.</p>
                        <p>Early yesterday morning I received a note from M. Jules Favre, thanking
                            me for my offer to communicate with you, and expressing a hope that I
                            might obtain your authorization to take the step indicated. I therefore
                            telegraphed you at noon yesterday, and received your reply at 10 o’clock
                            last night. On coming to my legation at 10 o’clock this morning, I found
                            M. Jules Favre awaiting me to ascertain the character of the dispatch I
                            had received from you. I read it to him and explained to him fully how
                            our Government stood in the matter. While he seemed to appreciate our
                            position, he was evidently a good deal disappointed, and was surprised
                            to learn of the action of the Prussian government, as communicated by
                            Mr. Bancroft, in rejecting intervention. On leaving, he thanked me
                            cordially for what I had done, and said he hoped that while our
                            Government could not intervene officially, it would give the new
                            republic of France its moral support.</p>

                            <p>A meeting of the diplomatic corps having been convoked by the Pope’s
                                nuncio the <hi rend="italic">doyen</hi> of the corps, some
                                twenty-two members of the body met at 11 o’clock a. m., Friday,
                                September 23, 1870, at the residence of the nuncio, No. 102 St.
                                Dominique St. Germain, Paris.</p>
                            <p>The nuncio stated his reasons for convoking the body. Their present
                                position as diplomatic representatives was comparatively a useless
                                one, as their communications were now cut off with their various
                                governments. He considered it proper that they should consult
                                together and decide—</p>
                            <p>First. Whether the time had come when it was proper for them to leave
                                Paris.</p>
                            <p>Secondly. Whether they would act together, or act separately.</p>
                            <p>Thirdly. If it should be decided not to leave at the present time,
                                that it should be determined what steps were to be taken to send and
                                receive dispatches through the military lines.</p>
                            <p>The nuncio thought the time had not yet arrived for the corps to
                                leave. He thought it best for the members to act collectively, and
                                he hoped measures would be taken so that they could communicate with
                                their governments. He concluded by asking a general expression of
                                opinion.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Kern, the Swiss minister, expressed a decided opinion that it was
                                not proper for the body to leave now. The time for leaving would be,
                                according to diplomatic usage, when the notice of bombardment had
                                been received. He had thought strange of certain members of the
                                corps leaving without notice or consultation with their colleagues.
                                He thought it was more dignified to remain and act collectively. He
                                washed the nuncio to take upon himself to communicate with the
                                minister of foreign affairs and obtain all information possible in
                                relation to communicating through the military lines, and to arrange
                                for egress, if it should become necessary, of the diplomatic
                                corps.</p>
                            <p>After a few observations of Baron de Zuylen de Nyevelt, envoy
                                extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of Holland, and by Baron
                                Beyers, envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of Belgium,
                                Mr. Washburne remarked that he fully agreed with the opinions
                                expressed by his colleagues who had spoken. He was obliged to the
                                nuncio, who had taken the trouble to convoke the body, for, in the
                                circumstances that existed, he considered it important that they
                                should act in concert. He did not consider that the time had come
                                for the diplomatic corps to leave, for he thought they should stay
                                as long as possible, not only for the dignity of their own
                                governments, but for the protection of such of their countrymen as
                                might yet be in Paris. For himself, he wished to give to the
                                government of the national defense such consideration as was due to
                                it as a government recognized by the United States. He thought steps
                                should be taken immediately to open communication through the lines
                                for the dispatches of the diplomatic body, and that as soon as
                                anything was accomplished, another meeting should be convoked. It
                                would be unnecessary at the present meeting to take any steps in
                                relation to going out of the city, as the emergency had not arisen
                                to render it necessary to go.</p>
                            <p>After further and informal expression of opinions, the nuncio
                                consented to accept the mission confided to him, and he would
                                reconvene the body at an early day to report as to what had been
                                done.</p>
                            <p>The meeting then separated.</p>

                            <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Minister:</hi> The undersigned, E.
                                Tibergheim Ackerman, consul general of the Oriental Republic of
                                Uruguay; Jules Thirion, of the Dominican Republic; Gabriel Lafond de
                                Lurcy, consul general of the republic of Costa Rica; B. Fourguet,
                                consul general of the republic of Ecuador; Francisco Fernandez
                                Rodella, consul general of the republic of Chili; Ludovic Janré,
                                consul of the republic of Paraguay; Eugene Thirion, consul of the
                                republic of the United States of Venezuela, considering that they
                                are clothed with consular functions by Southern and Central American
                                republics, who have no accredited diplomatic representatives in
                                Europe, or whose chiefs of legation are absent from Paris;
                                considering that, in the present grave circumstances and the
                                possibility of the occupation of the city of Paris by the Prussian
                                armies, who may attack the persons and property of neutrals whose
                                governments have treaties of friendship and commerce with Prussia or
                                with the German states at war with France; considering, finally,
                                that the undersigned consular officers do not find themselves
                                sufficiently protected, inasmuch as their isolated or collective
                                action toward the Prussian government is deprived of that diplomatic
                                character and sanction which can alone insure its efficiency; for
                                these motives the undersigned, invoking the sentiments of union and
                                fraternity which should unite states having republican institutions
                                in common, have the honor to pray you, sir, in the name of the law
                                of nations, of justice, and of humanity, to take under the official
                                protection of the United States of America the chanceries of the
                                above-mentioned republics.</p>
                            <p>The undersigned hope, sir, that in case of attack or the occupation
                                of Paris, you will kindly interpose your good offices diplomatically
                                with the Prussian headquarters, and take such measures as you may
                                judge proper that the Prussian troops may be obliged to respect the
                                arms, flags, residences, persons, and families of the undersigned,
                                as well as their fellow-citizens, respectively, who may seek shelter
                                with them, by covering in this manner the undersigned and the
                                interests they represent with the powerful intervention of the
                                United States Government.</p>
                            <p>It is worthy of a great power like the American nation to lend its
                                protecting aid to sister and friendly republics who have not yet
                                acquired the necessary development to make right stronger than force
                                in Europe.</p>
                            <p>Such an act of good will on your part, sir, solicited by the
                                undersigned, is perfectly legitimate, in view of events and of the
                                present position.</p>
                            <p>It will be received gratefully by the governments of the undersigned,
                                and will constitute <pb n="124" xml:id="pg_124" facs="0158"/>a debt
                                of gratitude which can only draw closer the bonds of active and
                                cordial sympathy which bind them to the glorious republic founded by
                                Washington.</p>
                            <p>The undersigned beg you, sir, to kindly receive the assurances of
                                their highest consideration and of their profound respect.</p>

                                Tibergheim Ackerman, consul general of the Oriental Republic of
                                Uruguay; Jules Thirion, consul general of the Dominican Republic;

                                Chili; Ludovic Janré, consul of the republic of Paraguay; Eugene
                                Thirion, consul of the republic of the United States of Venezuela,
                                who are clothed with consular functions by the Southern and Central
                                American republics, state to me that they have either no accredited
                                diplomatic representative in Europe, or that the chiefs of such
                                legations as have representatives at Paris are absent from the city.
                                Considering-therefore the grave circumstances at present existing in
                                Paris, they have done me the honor to request that I might, as the
                                representative of a sister and friendly republic, extend my good
                                offices and friendly protection to the arms, flags, and residences
                                of their consulates general and consulates, as well as to their
                                fellow citizens finding themselves in Paris.</p>
                            <p>As I am without the means of communication with my Government on the
                                subject, I shall assume that it would desire me, under the
                                circumstances, to extend my good offices and protection in every
                                proper manner, but with the knowledge and consent of the government
                                of the national defense. I have the honor therefore to submit this
                                matter to the consideration of your excellency, with a request that
                                you may inform me if the consent of your Government will be given to
                                me to extend my good offices and protection as herein indicated, and
                                in a manner in conformity with the law of nations and the amity that

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> You did me the honor to write me on
                                the 24th of this month to inform me of the wish expressed to you by
                                the consuls general and by the consuls of the republics, viz:
                                Dominican, of Uruguay, of Costa Rica, of Ecuador, of Chili, of
                                Paraguay, and of Venezuela, to place under our protection, and to
                                confide to your good offices, the arms, flags, and residences of the
                                consulates, as well as their fellow countrymen residing in
                                Paris.</p>
                            <p>I hasten to inform you that the government of the national defense,
                                to whom I have submitted this request, has authorized me to receive
                                it favorably. The foreign consuls <pb n="125" xml:id="pg_125"
                                    facs="0159"/>certainly could not make a choice which would be
                                more acceptable to us than that of the representative of the United
                                States. However, as certain of them are French, it should be
                                understood that (conformably, too, to what is stipulated in their
                                exequaturs) the favor solicited by them is not to have the effect of
                                keeping them personally from the obligations and duties imposed upon
                                them in their quality of Frenchmen. The position in France of the
                                citizens of the republic of South America, in time of war as in time
                                of peace, is settled by treaties. As far as those republics are
                                concerned which have made choice of Frenchmen as consuls, the
                                application of the measures of favor stipulated in those treaties
                                can extend only to the archives of the consulates and to the
                                foreigners depending upon them, and this only for what depends upon
                                the competency or the powers of the French administration.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Gentlemen:</hi> I have the honor to acknowledge
                                the receipt of your communication of the 22d instant, asking that,
                                in the present grave circumstances existing in Paris, I might
                                interpose my good offices to protect the arms, flags, residences,
                                &amp;c., of your respective consulates. Not being able to
                                communicate with my Government on the subject, I took it for granted
                                that on account of the warm feeling of friendship it feels for
                                sister republics, it would most willingly have me assume all the
                                good offices and protection which I could properly render in the
                                premises.</p>
                            <p>I deemed it proper, however, before giving you this assurance, to
                                advise the government of the national defense of your request, and
                                to ask its permission to act in accordance therewith, in a manner in
                                conformity with the law of nations and the amity that exists between
                                friendly powers. I have had the honor to receive a reply from his
                                excellency Jules Favre, the minister of foreign affairs, a copy of
                                which I beg leave to inclose herewith for your information. In

                                and friendly protection of my Government, so far as they may be in

                            <p>My Government will feel highly complimented by the distinguished mark
                                of confidence shown to it by its sister republics of Central and
                                South America. The Government and the people of the United States
                                take the deepest interest in all that concerns their welfare and

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> Much to my surprise and gratification
                            General Burnside and Paul Forbes, esq., made their appearance at my
                            house this morning, at 8.30 o’clock. They were courteously permitted to
                            come through the Prussian lines by Count Bismarck, and to bring me a
                            small dispatch bag, made up by Mr. Stevens, on the 23d ultimo, in
                            London. It contained the dispatch of Mr. Davis, of the 8th ultimo, and
                            New York dates to the 10th.</p>
                        <p>These gentlemen are the first and only persons who have entered Paris
                            from the Prussian lines for two weeks. I have sent dispatches out on two
                            or three different occasions, by persons leaving the city, but have not
                            before to-day received anything whatever from outside of the city.</p>
                        <p>Of course, I know nothing of the Prussian force around Paris, nor
                            anything of their plans or operations. As to matters in Paris, I can
                            only say that there has been the most wonderful change in the last two
                            weeks. The report of Jules Favre seems to have changed the face of
                            things entirely. All Paris is now apparently united and determined. They
                            claim to have five hundred thousand troops in the city. Ten thousand
                            sailors man their outer forts, which are mostly supplied with naval guns
                            of the heaviest caliber.</p>
                        <p>The inner defenses are wonderfully strong.</p>
                        <p rend="center">* * * * * *</p>
                        <p>The diplomatic corps has come to no decision in regard to leaving Paris.
                            I expect we shall know to-day the decision of the Prussian authorities
                            in regard to our sending out and receiving our dispatches. I think there
                            must be some three hundred of our countrymen now in Paris, and many of
                            them are anxious to get away. It is now doubtful whether they will be
                            permitted to go out, either by the French or Prussian authorities. I
                            would, no doubt, be permitted to leave at any time, but should
                            permission to depart be refused to my countrymen I should consider it my
                            duty to remain. However anxious I might be myself to get away, I should
                            deem it a species of cowardice to avail myself of my diplomatic
                            privilege to depart and leave my <hi rend="italic">nationaux</hi> behind
                            me to take care of themselves. I am certain such a course would not meet
                            with the approbation of my Government, as it certainly would not of my
                            own conscience. If, however, such Americans as may want to depart are
                            permitted to go, I may then leave whenever I think the interest of my
                            Government would be better served by my being out of Paris than by
                            remaining in it.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> General Burnside and Mr. Forbes left to go
                            through the Prussian lines yesterday. The general took the bag, in which
                            I had inclosed <pb n="127" xml:id="pg_127" facs="0161"/>several
                            dispatches. My colleague of the diplomatic corps, Mr. Caicedo, the
                            minister resident of the United States of Colombia, expects to leave
                            to-morrow morning, and I propose intrusting this dispatch to him to be
                            delivered to Mr. Stevens in London. The diplomatic corps has received no
                            answer to the application to the Prussian authorities to be permitted to
                            send a courier through the military lines to take official dispatches to
                            their respective governments. Count Bismarck writes to Jules Favre that
                            such permission will be granted only on the condition that such
                            dispatches shall be unsealed and subject to the inspection of the
                            Prussian authorities, and contain nothing in relation to the war. For
                            myself, I determined instantly that I would not send dispatches under
                            any such conditions, for I assumed that the Government of the United
                            States would permit no other government to examine the official
                            dispatches of its diplomatic representatives. At a meeting of the corps
                            this morning to consider the question, it was unanimously determined not
                            to accept any such condition. The Prussian authorities will be advised
                            of that decision, and no other application will be made to them. If the
                            siege continue, and I remain in Paris, it will be for you to determine
                            as to the measures to be taken to hold official communication with
                            me.</p>
                        <p>It seems that the nuncio, acting as the <hi rend="italic">doyen</hi> of
                            the diplomatic corps, had requested Jules Favre to ask Count Bismarck to
                            advise the corps whenever the bombardment of the city was to take place.
                            That fact only came to my knowledge yesterday, and I sent word to Count
                            Bismarck, by General Burnside, that I had nothing to do with such a
                            request, as I conceived that, according to the laws of war, the
                            diplomatic corns had a right to a notification of bombardment without
                            asking for it.</p>

                            <p>In accordance with a previous notice, the diplomatic corps met at the
                                residence of the Pope’s nuncio at eleven o’clock on Tuesday, the 4th

                            <p>The nuncio reported to the meeting that, in pursuance of the previous

                                requested him to communicate with Count Bismarck for the purpose of
                                ascertaining, first, whether he would give notice to the diplomatic
                                corps of a bombardment; and, second, whether he would permit a
                                courier to pass the Prussian military lines to take out and bring in
                                official dispatches for the members of the body. After a long delay
                                Mr. Jules Favre had received the response of Count Bismarck, the
                                substance of which he had in his hands and would read. As to the
                                first matter, Count Bismarck said that he was unable at the moment
                                to state what the necessities of the war might require; and,
                                touching the request for a courier, he would allow one to pass the
                                lines once a week to bear official dispatches, provided such
                                dispatches should not be sealed, and have no reference to the war.
                                The nuncio said the first answer was evasive, and that the condition
                                imposed in relation to the <pb n="128" xml:id="pg_128" facs="0162"
                                />manner of sending dispatches would render it impossible for the
                                diplomatic body to avail themselves of Count Bismarck’s offer.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Kern, the minister from Switzerland, said there had been a
                                misapprehension as to the communication to Count Bismarck. It should
                                not have been a communication by Jules Favre to Bismarck, but the
                                nuncio should, as the organ of the diplomatic corps have written
                                direct to him and sent it through Favre as the intermediary. In
                                regard to the inquiry which had been directed to Count Bismarck,
                                touching the bombardment, he certainly should have strongly
                                protested against it. The diplomatic corps had a right by the laws
                                of war to a notice of bombardment, and the body had been placed in a
                                false position by requesting something which they had a right to
                                without asking for it.* <note n="*" xml:id="d91fn1"> As to availing
                                    himself of a courier to take his dispatches, he would reject it
                                    at once, as the condition was disrespectful not only to his
                                    government, but to himself.</note></p>
                            <p>Baron Beyens, the Belgian minister, expressed himself as not being
                                very clear in regard to the questions which had been raised; some of
                                the people in the Foreign Office had told him that the diplomatic
                                corps had no right to a notice of bombardment. Mr. Kern replied he
                                considered such opinions of no value; he had himself studied the
                                question, and he had no doubts on the subject. He would further say,
                                in relation to the courier, that, as a matter of courtesy due to
                                their respective governments, the diplomatic corps had a right to be
                                advised by the Prussian authorities of their intention to cut off
                                their communications with their governments. Baron de Zuylen de
                                Nyevelt, minister of Holland, said the Prussian authorities ought to
                                be informed at once of the presence of the diplomatic corps in
                                Paris, and that they rejected the offer of a courier on the terms
                                proposed.</p>
                            <p>Mr. P. Galvez, envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary from
                                Peru, said that body owed it to the countries they represented, to
                                the dignity of the diplomatic service, as well as to themselves, to
                                respond negatively to Count Bismarck’s proposition to have their
                                official correspondence sent unsealed.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Washburne, minister of the United States, said there seemed to
                                have been a misapprehension in regard to the character of the
                                communication sent by Mr. Jules Favre, on behalf of the diplomatic
                                corps, to Count Bismarck. He had not understood that a request had
                                been sent to have notice given to the diplomatic corps when the
                                bombardment would take place. He conceived that no such request
                                should have been made, for the diplomatic body had a right to that
                                notice without asking for it. He would further reject instantly any
                                concession of a courier, coupled with the condition that his
                                dispatches should go unsealed. He would not write a dispatch to his
                                government which would have to be submitted to the inspection of any
                                other government on the face of the earth.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Kern, Baron de Zuylen de Nyevelt, and Mr. Washburne were then
                                joined to the nuncio, as a committee to draw up a communication, to
                                be signed by all the members of the corps in Paris, to be sent to
                                Count Bismarck; the same to be submitted to a future meeting for
                                approval.</p>

                                given by the nuncio yesterday. The committee submitted the answer to
                                Count Bismarck that had been drawn up, which was unanimously agreed
                                to and signed by all the members.</p>
                            <p>The communication is hereto annexed.</p>

                            <p>The undersigned, members of the diplomatic corps residing at Paris,
                                had the honor to send to your excellency, on the 24th of September
                                last, the expression of their wish, that a courier, carrying their
                                official dispatches, might pass the lines of the besieging army
                                every week on days to be hereafter named, and proceed to some point
                                whence a regular postal communication could be assured.</p>
                            <p>The minister of foreign affairs of France has informed us, by a
                                letter of October 3, that he had the day before received as the
                                reply of your excellency, ‘‘that a diplomatic courier could not pass
                                the lines of the besieging troops except upon condition that the
                                dispatches be unsealed, and treat of no subject relating to the
                                war.”</p>
                            <pb n="129" xml:id="pg_129" facs="0163"/>
                            <p>We should have made it a duty, as regards the contents of our
                                dispatches, to conform scrupulously to the obligations imposed
                                during a siege upon diplomatic agents by the rules and usages of
                                international law.</p>
                            <p>On the other hand, our position as diplomatic agents, and our
                                obligations toward our governments, do not permit us to accept the
                                other condition, viz: to address to them unsealed dispatches
                                only.</p>
                            <p>If this last condition is to be maintained, it will be impossible for
                                the diplomatic representatives of the neutral states, to their deep
                                regret, to keep up official communication with their respective

                            asked General Burnside to procure, if possible, the permission of the
                            Prussian authorities to go through their military lines. The general
                            having advised me that Count de Bismarck had authorized him to say that
                            he would permit all Americans to go through their lines that I would ask
                            for, I yesterday made application to the French government for authority
                            to the citizens of the United States to leave the city, and go through
                            their military lines. Just as I was about to close my dispatches to send
                            out early in the morning, I received the letter from Mr. Jules Favre
                            which I have the honor to send herewith. I must confess that I was very
                            much surprised and disappointed. If the decision is adhered to in its
                            full force, the disappointment to large numbers of our countrymen now in
                            Paris will be <pb n="130" xml:id="pg_130" facs="0164"/>very great. I
                            estimate that there are between two hundred and two hundred and fifty
                            Americans now in Paris, and that about one hundred of them are anxious
                            to leave. Among this number desirous of going away are found many cut
                            off from their communications from home, who are without funds, and who
                            have no means whatever of living. If the siege continues for a long
                            time, and they cannot get away, their condition must become deplorable
                            in the extreme. I need not say that matters are becoming very
                            embarrassing, but I hope we shall get through in some satisfactory way.
                            I shall look further into this matter of the departure of our people,
                            and write you by the first opportunity.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir and Bear Minister:</hi> Conformably to the
                                desire which you have done me the honor to express to me yesterday,
                                I transmit to your excellency the letter addressed to the minister
                                of war, to notify him of the departure of your courier. I beg you to
                                send it to him at, once, with notice of the precise hour of his
                                departure.</p>
                            <p>As regards the permission solicited by a number of your countrymen to
                                pass our lines to leave Paris, I have asked for it from the only
                                competent authority, that is to say, from the governor of Paris. He
                                was of opinion that the difficulties raised by this request, being
                                political as well as military, the government ought to examine them.
                                The government has done so, with a strong desire to be agreeable
                                personally, and to give to your nation a new proof of its sincere
                                cordiality. But however powerful are these considerations upon our
                                minds, we have been checked by the absolute impossibility which we
                                find ourselves in of satisfying the requests of a similar nature
                                which are constantly made. The number of strangers who have not left
                                Paris is very great; many of them have asked of us permission to
                                leave Paris, which we have been obliged to refuse for reasons of
                                defense, of which your excellency will, without doubt, appreciate
                                the value. To grant them would be to annul our military operations;
                                to make exceptions would be to create an unjustifiable privilege. I
                                have therefore the regret to notify your excellency that the
                                government is of opinion that permission to leave Paris during the
                                siege can only be granted to persons clothed with a diplomatic
                                character.</p>
                            <p>I beg your excellency to believe that it is extremely painful to me
                                not to be able to be agreeable to you. It is one of the griefs which
                                war imposes upon us, and it is one of those to which I can least
                                easily reconcile myself.</p>
                            <p>I beg your excellency, &amp;c., &amp;c.,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> The minister of the United States of
                            Colombia, Mr. Caicedo, before leaving Paris, with all the “personnel”
                            his legation, requested me to take under my protection the few
                            Colombians who might remain in Paris. I promised to do so very
                            cheerfully, glad of the opportunity to render a service to a sister
                            American republic; but as there are very few Colombians in Paris, and
                            their interests are not large, I have not thought it worth while to
                            trouble the French government with a request for its assent. My
                            protection will be simply “officious.”</p>
                        <p>The chargé d’affaires of Portugal, the Vicomte de Lancastre, who proposes
                            to leave Paris tomorrow, has also asked me to extend our protection to
                            his fellow-subjects remaining in Paris. I have consented to do so; but
                            as this is a matter of more importance, in view of the number <pb
                                n="131" xml:id="pg_131" facs="0165"/>of persons and the importance
                            of the interests at stake, I have asked the consent of the government of
                            the national defense. This has been promptly accorded. The request of
                            the Vicomte de Lancastre was made by direction of his government.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to my dispatch of the 18th
                            instant, and numbered 305, I have the honor to state that I have this
                            day received from the government of the national defense the permission
                            for my countrymen to leave Paris. They are to leave, therefore, on
                            Thursday morning next, by the way of Créteil.</p>
                        <p>It had been twice decided that at this state of the siege no foreigner
                            would be permitted to leave Paris, but after having several interviews
                            on the subject with General Trochu and Mr. Jules Favre, they finally
                            agreed to change their determination, and let all of our Americans go
                            who wanted to leave. I think this decision is mainly due to a friendly
                            feeling toward our Government. From the beginning, Mr. Jules Favre
                            evinced every desire to gratify my wishes in this regard. The granting
                            of the permission for the Americans to leave involved a like permission
                            for the subjects of other neutral powers; and as the Prussian
                            authorities require that I shall give a pass to every person who desires
                            to traverse their military lines, I am likely to have a good deal of
                            work on hand for the next two days. I have had prepared a special
                            passport for this purpose, a copy of which I have the honor to inclose
                            herewith.</p>

                            French authorities for them to leave. They had insisted that the whole
                            number of those who intended to leave should go out at the same time on
                            Thursday last. The English and the Swiss received yesterday from Count
                            de Bismarck their permission to pass the Prussian lines, but the French
                            authorities now hesitate to fix the day on which they may leave. The
                            Russians went out on the same day as the Americans. I ‘believe there is
                            yet some trouble about the Austrians going out. I am very glad that I
                            have so many of our countrymen safely away.</p>

                            <p>According to your instructions, and having previously obtained from
                                the governor of Paris, General Trochu, the necessary pass for the
                                list of Americans drawn up at this legation, I proceeded on
                                horseback, as per appointment, at 6 a. m., with two staff officers,
                                trumpeter, and flag of truce, to the gate of Charenton, where the
                                convoy was to meet. Having formed the line, we passed out of the
                                city under military escort, and proceeded to the village of Créteil,
                                on the post road to Bale, just beyond which was the Prussian
                                outpost. Before reaching the village, however, an examination of
                                your passes was made. Leaving the convoy in Créteil, the staff
                                officers, flag of truce, trumpeter, and myself rode up to within a
                                hundred yards of the Prussian barricade outpost. After waiting some
                                time, and doing considerable trumpeting, a lieutenant and two
                                soldiers appeared bearing a white flag. We parleyed, and, on the
                                arrival of his superior officer, ordered on the convoy.</p>
                            <p>Examination of your passes was again made by Lieutenant Tillié, of
                                Seventy-fifth regiment of the line, and myself; and German <hi

                                lieutenant for the occupants of each carriage, prescribing their
                                line of march, the convoy, consisting of forty-eight Americans,
                                (men, women, and children,) in nineteen carriages, as per list
                                herewith, (as also the Russian convoy of seven carriages and
                                twenty-one persons, having your passes,) then passed on through the
                                barricade into the Prussian lines; from whence I was informed they
                                would proceed, each carriage escorted by a soldier, to the Prussian
                                post beyond, at Boissy. Your son and Colonel Hoffman went to the
                                outpost and returned with me to Paris, where I reported at the
                                legation the execution of your instructions.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> Having before them the resolution
                                adopted by the government of national defense, to continue a
                                hopeless struggle and to defend Paris as long as provisions will
                                last, the government of his Majesty have felt obliged to give their
                                attention to the consequences which the carrying out of that
                                resolution will entail upon the inhabitants of Paris, consisting, as
                                they do, for a great part of foreigners. By a memoir communicated to
                                foreign cabinets some weeks since, we have declined any
                                responsibility for the sufferings to which the residents will find
                                themselves exposed when the resources are exhausted and when, owing
                                to the waste laid all around Paris by order of the French government
                                at an extent of three or four days’ marching, it will be impossible
                                to provide the survivors with food or to transport them beyond the
                                zone of destruction.</p>
                            <p>While sending you a translation of the said memoir, I take the
                                liberty of earnestly calling your attention to the considerations
                                detailed therein and bearing directly upon the interests of those
                                American residents who, either by their condition of life or for
                                want of means, have been obliged to remain at Paris.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir: I</hi> have waited till a very late hour before
                            commencing my dispatch, which I hope to be able to start off at a very
                            early hour to-morrow morning. The day has been one of much excitement
                            and interest. The arrival of M. Thiers, the disgraceful affair of Le
                            Bourget, of yesterday, when the French permitted the Prussians to
                            surprise them and recapture the town, and the terrible news of the fall
                            of Metz, all conspired to create a profound excitement in Paris. It is
                            almost impossible to get at the truth in regard to the state of affairs;
                            but as near as I can learn, some of the dissatisfied national guards and
                            a crowd of the red republicans invaded the Hotel de Ville this afternoon
                            and took the government of the national defense prisoners. They then
                            went to work and organized what they called the “government of the
                            commune,” and fixed upon the candidates to be elected to-morrow by a
                            vote of the people of Paris. I inclose you a card containing a list of
                            the names of the persons to form this new government of the red
                            republic. I went to the Hotel de Ville at 6 o’clock to-night and found
                            that it had been invaded by soldiers. The magnificent hall of the
                            municipal council was densely <pb n="134" xml:id="pg_134" facs="0168"
                            />packed with soldiers, singing, shouting, yelling, and speech-making.
                            All seemed to consider that the revolution was practically accomplished,
                            and that nothing was wanting but a vote of the people of Paris, to be
                            taken to-morrow. I have just learned, however, that General Trochu and
                            Jules Favre escaped early in the evening, and that they are now
                            organizing to put down these new revolutionists. At any rate, the <hi
                                rend="italic">generate</hi> is everywhere beating, and gentlemen
                            bring me the intelligence that the center of the city is literally
                            packed with troops, and that everybody is expecting a collision
                            to-night. My messenger is obliged to start so early in the morning, in
                            order to meet the flag of truce, that I can give you no further
                            intelligence before he leaves. I send you several papers, issued this
                            evening, though dated to-morrow, which you will find contain a good deal
                            on this subject.</p>
                        <p>In all this turmoil and excitement to-day, I have not been able to find
                            out anything in regard to the result of the mission of M. Thiers. He
                            left at 3 o’clock this afternoon to return to Versailles.</p>

                            been directed by his government to address the following communication
                            to the Secretary of State of the United States.</p>
                        <p>His Majesty the Emperor of the French having found himself under the
                            necessity, in order to defend the honor and interests of France, and at
                            the same time to protect the general equilibrium of Europe, of declaring
                            war against Prussia and the allied countries which lend her the support
                            of their arms:</p>
                        <p>His Majesty has given orders that, in the prosecution of this war, the
                            commanders of his forces on land and sea should scrupulously observe,
                            with regard to powers which shall remain neutral, the rules of
                            international law, and that they should especially conform to the
                            principles embraced in the declaration of the congress of Paris of the
                            16th of April, 1856, to wit:</p>
                        <p>1. Privateering is and remains abolished.</p>
                        <p>2. The neutral flag covers enemy’s goods, with the exception of
                            contraband of war.</p>
                        <p>3. Neutral goods, with the exception of contraband of war, are not liable
                            to capture under enemy’s flag.</p>
                        <p>4. Blockades, in order to be binding, must be effective; that is to say,
                            maintained by a force sufficient really to prevent access to the coast
                            of the enemy.</p>
                        <pb n="136" xml:id="pg_136" facs="0170"/>
                        <p>Although Spain and the United States hare not adhered to the declaration
                            of 1856, the vessels of his Majesty will not seize the enemy’s property
                            found on board an American or Spanish ship, unless the property be
                            contraband of war.</p>
                        <p>Neither does his Majesty intend to claim the right to confiscate the
                            property of American or Spanish citizens which shall be found on board
                            of the ships of the enemy.</p>
                        <p>His Majesty is confident that, by a just reciprocity, the Government of
                            the United States will have the goodness to prescribe measures, so that
                            the authorities and the citizens of this country may observe with
                            precision on their part, during the continuance of the war, the duties
                            of a strict neutrality.</p>
                        <p>The undersigned takes this occasion to renew to the Secretary of State of
                            the United States the assurances of his very high consideration.</p>

                            plenipotentiary of his Majesty the Emperor of the French, informing this
                            Government that war has been declared by his Imperial Majesty against

                            observed by France toward all the powers which remain neutral.</p>
                        <p>The undersigned is directed by the President to express to the Government
                            of his Majesty the Emperor the satisfaction with which this Government
                            learns that these principles for which the United States have ever
                            contended, and most of which were long since embodied in treaties
                            between the United States and France, are to receive a further sanction
                            by the observance of them in the present war.</p>
                        <p>The undersigned is further directed to state to Mr. Berthemy that during
                            this contest the United States will observe the strictest neutrality
                            toward each and all the belligerents. The laws of the United States and
                            the law of nations, as expounded by the judicial and political
                            authorities of this country, are believed to be sufficient to prevent
                            any persons from attempting to infringe or compromit that neutrality by
                            participating in the contest in which two of the great powers of Europe
                            are now unhappily engaged. The United States, on the other hand, will
                            expect that their full rights as a neutral will be scrupulously
                            respected.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Monsieur:</hi> The cabinet of Berlin has published,
                            relative to the negotiations at Ems, various documents, in the number of
                            which is a dispatch from Baron de Werther, giving an account of a
                            conversation we had together during his last stay in this capital. These
                            papers do not present the veritable aspect of the course pursued by the
                            Emperor’s government under these circumstances, and the report of M. de
                            Werther especially attributes words to me which I believe my duty
                            requires me to rectify on several points.</p>
                        <p>The ambassador of Prussia, in our interview, dwelt particularly on this
                            consideration, that the King, in authorizing the candidature of Prince
                            de Hohenzollern, had never had any intention of wounding the Emperor,
                            and had never supposed that this combination could give umbrage to
                            France. I observed to my interlocutor that if such was the case a
                            similar assurance given would be of a nature to facilitate the accord we
                            were seeking. But I did not ask that the King should write a letter of
                            excuse, as the Berlin journals have pretended in their semiofficial
                            commentaries.</p>
                        <p>Nor can I agree to the observations which the baron attributes to me on
                            the subject of the declaration of the 6th of July. I did not admit that
                            this manifestation had been determined by parliamentary necessities. I
                            explained our language by the sharpness of the wound we had received,
                            and I in no way put forward the personal position of the ministers as
                            the motive determining their conduct. What I said was, that no cabinet
                            could preserve in France the confidence of the Chambers and public
                            opinion in consenting to an arrangement which did not contain a serious
                            guarantee for the future. I must add, contrary to the recital of M. de
                            Werther, that I made no distinction between the Emperor and France.
                            Nothing in my language could authorize the representative of Prussia to
                            suppose that a strict solidarity of impressions did not prevail between
                            the sovereign and the whole nation.</p>
                        <p>Those reserves made. I arrive at the principal reproach made against us
                            by the cabinet of Berlin. We are said to have voluntarily opened the
                            discussion with the King of Prussia instead of with his government. But
                            when, on the 4th of July, in accordance with my instructions, our chargé
                            d’affaires called upon Count de Thile to speak to him of the news we had
                            received from Spain, what was the language of the secretary of state?
                            According to his own expression, “the Prussian government was completely
                            ignorant of this affair, which did not exist for it.” In presence of the
                            attitude of the cabinet, which affected to have nothing to do with the
                            incident, and to consider it as solely regarding the Prussian royal
                            family, what could we do except apply to the King himself?</p>
                        <p>It is thus that, against our will, we requested our ambassador to place
                            himself in communication with the sovereign instead of treating with his
                            minister.</p>
                        <p>I have resided long enough in the courts of Europe to know how
                            disadvantageous that mode of negotiation is, and all the cabinets will
                            put faith in my words when I affirm that we only pursued that path
                            because all others were closed to us. We regret that Count de Bismarck,
                            as <pb n="138" xml:id="pg_138" facs="0172"/>soon as he was aware of the
                            gravity of the affair, had not gone to Ems to resume his natural
                            position as intermediary between the King and our ambassador. But are we
                            in reality responsible for the isolation in which his Majesty doubtless
                            desired to remain, and which the chancellor probably found favorable to
                            his designs? And if, as the cabinet of Berlin states, the declaration of
                            war remitted by our chargé d’affaires constitutes our first written and
                            official communication, whose is the fault? Are notes addressed to
                            sovereigns? Could our ambassador so far derogate from customary usages
                            when he was treating with the King, and is not the absence of any
                            document exchanged between the two governments the necessary consequence
                            of the obligation under which we were placed to pursue the discussion at
                            Ems, instead of continuing it at Berlin, where we had first raised
                            it?</p>
                        <p>Before closing these rectifications, I must refer to one observation of
                            the Prussian cabinet. According to a telegram from Berlin, published by
                            the journals of the 23d, MM. de Bismarck and de Thile, contesting a
                            passage in my circular dispatch of the 21st of July, declared that
                            “since the day they heard of the offer addressed to the Prince de
                            Hohenzollern, the question of that candidature to the throne of Spain
                            has never been the subject of the least conversation, either official or
                            private, between themselves and M. Benedetti.” In the form in which it
                            is produced, this affirmation is ambiguous; it seems to refer solely to
                            the relations of our ambassador with the Prussian ministry, posterior to
                            the acceptance of Prince Leopold. In that sense it would not be contrary
                            to what we have ourselves said; but if it is extended to anterior
                            communications, it ceases to be true, and to establish that fact I
                            cannot do better than cite here a dispatch dated the 31st of March,
                            1869, addressed by Count Benedetti to the Marquis de Lavalette, then
                            minister of foreign affairs.</p>
                        <p>It is thus conceived:</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">March</hi> 31, 1869.</p>
                        <p>M. <hi rend="smallcaps">le Marquis:</hi> Your excellency requested me by
                            telegraph yesterday to assure myself whether the candidature of the
                            Prince de Hohenzollern to the throne of Spain had a serious character. I
                            had occasion this morning to see M. de Thile, and I asked him if I was
                            to attach any importance to the rumors in circulation on this subject, I
                            did not conceal from him that I was anxious to be exactly informed,
                            remarking that such an eventuality was of too direct interest to the
                            Emperor’s government for my duty not to compel me to point out the
                            danger if any reason existed to believe that the project might be
                            realized. I made him aware that I intended to commuicate our
                            conversation to you.</p>
                        <p>M. de Thile gave me the most formal assurance that he had not at any
                            moment been aware of any indication whatever which could authorize such
                            a conjecture, and that the Spanish minister at Vienna, during the stay
                            he made in Berlin, had not even made any allusion to the subject. The
                            under secretary of state, in thus expressing himself, and without
                            anything I said being of a nature to induce such a manifestation,
                            believed himself called upon to pledge his word of honor.</p>
                        <p>According to him, M. Rancès had confined himself to talking to Count de
                            Bismarck— who perhaps was anxious to take advantage of the passage of
                            this diplomatist to obtain some information on the state of things in
                            Spain—of the manner in which affairs were advancing in what concerned
                            the choice of the future sovereign.</p>
                        <p>That, in substance, is what M. de Thile stated to me, several times
                            repeating his first declaration that there was not, and could not be, a
                            question of the Prince de Hohenzollern for the crown of Spain.</p>
                        <p>Accept, &amp;c.,</p>
                        <p rend="right">BENEDETTI.</p>
                        <p>After this quotation I believe I have no occasion to enter into any
                            further explanations on a point we must consider as definitively
                            established.</p>

                            Paris explain themselves so well by the inexorable logic of facts that
                            it is useless to dwell at length upon their meaning and scope.</p>
                        <p>Yielding to an irresistible impulse, too long restrained, the people of
                            Paris have obeyed a higher law, that of their own safety; they have not
                            been willing to perish with the criminal power which was leading France
                            to destruction; they have not declared the downhill of Napoleon III and
                            of his dynasty; they have registered it in the name of right and justice
                            and of the public safety, and this sentence was so well ratified in
                            advance by the consciences of all, that no one, even among the most
                            noisy defenders of the falling power, has arisen to sustain it; it has
                            sunk itself under the weight of its faults, amid the acclamations of an
                            immense people, without a drop of blood having been shed, without a
                            person’s having been deprived of his liberty; and we have seen a thing,
                            unheard of in history, the citizens, to whom the cry of the people
                            confided the perilous task of fighting and conquering, not giving a
                            moment’s uneasiness to the adversaries, who yesterday threatened them
                            with military execution. It is by refusing them the honor of any
                            repression that they have plainly shown their blindness and impotence.
                            Order has not been disturbed for a single moment. Our confidence in the
                            wisdom and patriotism of the national guard and of the entire population
                            permits us to assert that it will not be.</p>
                        <p>Delivered from the shame and danger of living under a government which
                            was recreant to all its duties, every one understands that the first act
                            of this national sovereignty, reconquered at last, is to command itself,
                            and to seek its strength in respect for the law. Moreover, time is
                            pressing; the enemy is at our gates; we have but one thought—to drive
                            him from our territory. But this obligation, which we resolutely accept,
                            has not been imposed upon France by us; France would not now be under
                            this obligation if our voice had been heard. We have energetically
                            defended, even at the expense of our popularity, the policy of peace; we
                            shall persevere in doing so, with a still deeper conviction. Our heart
                            bleeds at the sight of these inhuman massacres, whereby the flower of
                            two nations is destroyed, which, with a little good sense and a great
                            deal of liberty, would have been saved from these frightful
                            catastrophes. We have no words to describe our admiration for our heroic
                            army, sacrificed by the incompetency of the commander-in-chief, and yet
                            rendered greater by its defeats than by the most brilliant victories;
                            for, notwithstanding its knowledge of the faults which imperiled it, it
                            has sublimely advanced to certain death, redeeming the honor of France
                            from the stains brought upon it by its government. Honor to it! The
                            nation opens its arms to it. The imperial power has sought to divide
                            them; misfortunes and duty unite them in a solemn embrace, sealed by
                            patriotism and liberty. This alliance renders us invincible. Prepared
                            for everything, we calmly contemplate the situation which is presented
                            to us. I will state this situation in a few words, and submit my
                            statement to my country and to Europe: We openly denounce war, and,
                            protesting our respect for the rights of nations, we asked that Germany
                            should be left mistress of her destinies; we desired that liberty <pb
                                n="140" xml:id="pg_140" facs="0174"/>should be at once our common
                            bond and our common shield. We were convinced that these moral forces
                            insured forever the maintenance of peace; but, by way of enforcement, we
                            demanded a weapon for each citizen, a civic organization, and chosen
                            chiefs. We should then have remained invulnerable on our own soil. The
                            imperial government, which had long before separated its interests from
                            those of the country, rejected this policy. We resume it, with the hope
                            that, having been taught by experience, France will have the wisdom to
                            practice it.</p>
                        <p>On his part the King of Prussia has declared that he was making war, not
                            against France, but against the imperial dynasty. The dynasty lies
                            prostrate. Free France rises. Does the King of Prussia desire to
                            continue an impious struggle which will be at least as fatal to him as
                            to us? Does he desire to give to the world of the nineteenth century the
                            cruel spectacle of two nations destroying one another, and which,
                            forgetful of humanity, of reason, of science, pile up ruins and corpses?
                            He may take his choice. Let him assume this responsibility to the world
                            and to history. If it is a challenge, we accept it. We will not yield an
                            inch of our territory, nor a stone of our fortresses. A disgraceful
                            peace would soon be followed by a war of extermination; we will only
                            treat for a durable peace. Herein lies our interest, and that of all
                            Europe. We have reason to hope that, freed from every dynastic bias, the
                            question will be thus put to the chanceries. But even if we must stand
                            quite alone, we will not be discouraged. We have a resolute army,
                            well-supplied forts, strong walls, but above all, the breasts of three
                            hundred thousand fighting men, ready to hold out to the last. When they
                            go piously to place garlands at the feet of the statue in Strasburg,
                            they not only obey a sentiment of enthusiastic admiration, they take
                            their heroic watch-word, they swear to be worthy of their brothers of
                            Alsace, and to die like them. After the forts, the ramparts; after the
                            ramparts, the barricades. Paris can hold out for three months, and
                            conquer. If it should fall, France, rising at its call, would avenge it.
                            It would continue the struggle, and the aggressor would perish. This,
                            sir, is what Europe ought to know. We have not accepted power with any
                            other object. We would not retain it a minute if we did not find the
                            population of Paris, and of all France, resolved to aid in carrying out
                            this plan. I sum up our resolutions in one word. Before God, who hears
                            us—before posterity, which will judge us, we only desire peace; but if a
                            destructive war, which we have denounced, be continued against us, we
                            will do our duty to the end. I firmly trust that our cause, which is
                            that of right and justice, will finally triumph.</p>
                        <p>It is in this sense that I desire you to explain the situation to his
                            excellency the Secretary of State, in whose hands you will place a copy
                            of this document.</p>

                            represented by said government, in several official documents, as

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The Prussian government has pretended,
                                in documents of which we have had knowledge, that our soldiers have
                                disregarded the rules of international law, by voluntarily firing on
                                ambulances and hearers of flags of truce. Before even calling the
                                attention of the minister of war to these allegations, I protested
                                in the name of the traditions of our army, and as soon as my
                                colleague was informed of them, he warmly approved of the language
                                which I had used. Mistakes may occur in the heat of battle; we, more
                                just than our adversary, admit that neither of the two armies is
                                sure of not committing such errors. But Prussia will persuade no one
                                that our soldiers have deliberately set at naught the sacred
                                privilege of ambulances and the freedom of flags of truce, and we
                                have no need to defend ourselves against such accusations.</p>
                            <p>It seems, moreover, that the Prussian government has shown so much
                                eagerness to avail itself of facts, regrettable indeed, though
                                hitherto not proved, and at all events isolated, in order to have
                                some pretext to justify itself for much graver acts with which we
                                have to charge it, and for which the corps commanders are much more
                                directly responsible.</p>
                            <p>Every one knows the incident of the ambulance called “de la Presse,”
                                which was seized with the persons and supplies which it contained,
                                and which was obliged to pass through a part of Germany, and through
                                Luxemburg and Belgium, in order to reënter France. The same thing is
                                stated to have occurred again in the neighborhood of Metz.</p>
                            <p>Near Strasburg the Baron de Bussière was taken prisoner in the midst
                                of the ambulances which he had organized, and to which he was giving
                                his attention. It is equally notorious that a French surgeon was
                                killed on the field of battle by a Prussian soldier, while in the
                                act of attending to the injuries of a wounded man.</p>
                            <p>It further appears from the testimony given by one of our physicians,
                                in the presence of witnesses whose declaration has been received at
                                the vice-consulate of France, at Basle, that explosive bullets have
                                been used against our troops, and have been found in the bodies of
                                some of our wounded. These are so many violations, not only of the
                                usages of all armies in modern times, but also of the formal
                                stipulations of diplomatic conventions to which Prussia was a
                                contracting party.</p>
                            <p>Finally, the public journals have announced that the peasants near
                                Strasburg have been required to dig the trenches opened by the
                                Prussians before the place. We at first refused to give credit to
                                these rumors. We could not regard as possible an act of violence no
                                less repugnant to the laws of war than to those of humanity. The
                                certain proofs which have since reached us leave no longer any doubt
                                concerning the entire accuracy of these statements. The Prussian
                                authorities have not hesitated to adopt a measure which obliges the
                                defenders of Strasburg to fire on Frenchmen.</p>
                            <p>If Prussia should continue these odious proceedings she would stamp
                                her military operations with a character for atrocity which would
                                place her under the ban of civilized nations. We protest in the name
                                of universal conscience against such abuses of power, and in
                                requesting you to call to them the particular attention of the
                                Government to which you are accredited, I feel confident that public
                                opinion will visit them with just condemnation.</p>

                                the treatment which Prussia intends to reserve for our independent

                                be removed or replaced at any moment, so that it becomes impossible
                                for the Prussian troops to distinguish the persons from whom they
                                have to expect acts of hostility and on whom they ought to fire. He
                                announces, in consequence, that all those who, not being on all
                                occasions and at a proper distance recognizable as soldiers, may
                                kill or wound any Prussians, shall be tried by court-martial.</p>
                            <p>I have transmitted this communication to the minister of war. The
                                following is his reply:</p>
                            <p>The national garde mobile and the independent marksmen, who are
                                assimilated thereto by their organization, or who have been formed
                                by regular authority, represent a force constituted by French law.
                                Their costume has been defined, and the blue blouse with red
                                ornaments of the men of the national garde mobile, who also wear the
                                military cap, cannot be confounded, in good faith, with the garb of
                                the peasants of France. The minister of war does not, therefore,
                                hesitate to declare that if Prussia treats such troops as not
                                belonging to the army, the French corps commanders will retaliate
                                upon the men of the landwehr and of the landsturm, who represent the
                                same forces in Germany.</p>
                            <p>I beg you, sir, to bring this declaration to the notice of the
                                government to which you are accredited, and I do not doubt that it
                                will share the impression made upon us by the proceeding in
                                question, as likewise by the painful necessity under which it places
                                us.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> The Prussian official journal, and all
                                the German papers which obey the same inspirations, have sought to
                                excite public opinion against us on account of the measures which
                                the subjects of Prussia and its allies have been the object in
                                France since the commencement of the war.</p>
                            <p>It has been openly asserted, and every effort is made to induce the
                                belief, that the government of the Emperor, after having first
                                tolerated the presence of citizens of the enemy’s country, took
                                measures for their general expulsion. This assertion is absolutely
                                at variance with the truth, and of this the cabinet of Berlin cannot
                                be ignorant.</p>
                            <p>When the ministry of the 10th of August was called to power, it was
                                obliged, by reason of the circumstances, to examine the situation of
                                the Germans in France. It did so, regarding the interest of the
                                country and the personal security of these foreigners at the same
                                time, for it was obliged to consider the annoying consequences of
                                the great excitement which is caused in France by excesses of all
                                kinds committed in the rural districts against an unoffending
                                population, and a system of espionage without precedent in the
                                annals of war.</p>
                            <p>The government did not, however, adopt a general measure of
                                expulsion, however legitimate it would have been after the unworthy
                                treatment of which our citizens, and even some French consular
                                agents, have been the victims in Germany. It confined itself to
                                favoring the removal of all those who desired to return to their own
                                country. To this effect the minister of the interior exempted them
                                from the formality of safe conducts for leaving the country, and
                                from that of the French visa previously required for their
                                passports. The mass of the German residents, so numerous throughout
                                the territory of the empire, was in no wise affected.</p>
                            <p>Friendly explanations were given on this subject by the minister of
                                the interior and myself to the ministers of America and Switzerland,
                                as well as to the chargé d’affaires of Russia, to which
                                functionaries the German governments had confided the protection of
                                their citizens in France. In fact, the majority of these foreigners
                                did not leave the territory of the empire. Everyone knows with what
                                moderation the orders of the French government were enforced, and no
                                one can truthfully maintain, as is done by the Berlin journals, that
                                the Emperor’s government has shown itself pitiless and cruel toward
                                the German residents.</p>
                            <p>Quite recently, in view of the march of the Prussian army on Paris,
                                General Trochu, <pb n="143" xml:id="pg_143" facs="0177"/>by virtue
                                of the powers intrusted to him, promulgated an order obliging every
                                subject of the enemy to leave Paris and the department of the Seine
                                in the space of three days, and to leave France or to retire to one
                                of the departments situated beyond the Loire.</p>
                            <p>This measure was dictated by considerations of public necessity, upon
                                which I have no need to insist, and in my previous interviews with
                                the ministers of the United States and Switzerland, as well as with
                                the chargé d’affaires of Russia, I had taken care to reserve with
                                regard to this the full and entire liberty of appreciation of the
                                government. The presence of several thousands of Germans in Paris
                                during the operations of a siege would have been a source of peril
                                to themselves as well as of danger to the defense, and every one
                                understood that this order, however painful it was to those affected
                                by it, still bore the impress of that generous sentiment by which
                                the French people are habitually actuated in their conduct, even
                                toward an enemy, in the midst of the heat of a struggle; for their
                                patriotism will never cause them to forget the laws of humanity. The
                                government, moreover, in the order of August 28 stopped short of
                                what it might legitimately have done, since it confined itself to
                                removing the Germans from the capital, still allowing them to remain
                                in the departments situated beyond the Loire, and this restriction,
                                placed by ourselves upon the exercise of our right, is a new and
                                irrecusable evidence of the falsity of the allegation of the
                                Prussian official journal, according to which, since the 10th of
                                August, all Germans settled in France have been included in a
                                measure of expulsion. I beg you to point out the falseness of these
                                assertions to the Cabinet at Washington, and in order to reduce them
                                to their just value it will be sufficient for you to oppose to them
                                our acts.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your dispatch, No. 55, and I am happy that the Department so
                            warmly approves of my administration of this responsible and laborious
                            office.</p>
                        <p>At this time the labor and responsibility have greatly increased, Since
                            the war broke out the daily number of invoices is very large, averaging
                            above one hundred, and in some instances reaching two hundred and forty
                            a day; while passports have averaged sixty per day. When the Bank of
                            France suspended specie payment there was in the safe 6,000 francs in
                            paper, which had been taken within the preceding three or four days for
                            Government fees. To-day it is almost impossible to obtain gold, and it
                            commands a premium of 5 per cent., while silver is at 1½. Under the
                            circumstances, I telegraphed to you on the 16th instant as follows:</p>
                        <p>Paper depreciating daily. Also difference between silver and gold.
                            Average daily receipts thirteen hundred francs. Very little gold in
                            circulation. What am I to do?</p>
                        <pb n="145" xml:id="pg_145" facs="0179"/>
                        <p>I received the next day this reply:</p>
                        <p>Secretary of the Treasury says, take gold till further orders.</p>
                        <p>Anticipating this, I had ordered that morning that gold only be received,
                            except for fractional sums, when silver would be taken. This regulation
                            produced immediate difficulty, for it had become almost impossible to
                            procure gold, and I accordingly telegraphed you again yesterday:</p>
                        <p>No gold to be had; only silver.</p>
                        <p>Receiving no answer, and finding that the excitement was increasing and
                            the probability of obtaining gold becoming less every hour, I
                            telegraphed this morning as follows:</p>
                        <p>Cannot get gold. Silver only can be had. Business clogged and people
                            indignant. I stronly advise taking silver. Can I bank with Hottinguer,
                            Barings’ correspondent here; unwilling to have reponsibility of funds at
                            this time.</p>
                        <p>I am awaiting the reply with anxiety for several reasons. You are aware
                            that I have been charged with the consular affairs of the North German
                            Confederation throughout France. This has been and continues to be a
                            very vexatious and troublesome charge, especially since the French
                            government (who have been forced into it by the feelings of the masses
                            of the people) have decreed the immediate departure of all North Germans
                            from France. I have been obliged from day to day and hour to hour to
                            send by telegraph and mails explicit instructions to all our consular
                            officers to guide them in their new duties in this matter. Americans are
                            just now extremely unpopular here, owing to the sympathy shown by the
                            people of the United States for Germany. When, in addition, one
                            identifies himself so far with the Prussians as to become their
                            representative, he incurs an amount of dislike and even hatred which may
                            prove not only disagreeable, but actually dangerous to himself and his
                            surroundings in the present highly-excited state of the public mind. It
                            becomes, therefore, extremely desirable not to give rise, if possible,
                            to further ill-feeling.</p>
                        <p>The regulation of the Department to receive only gold has produced,
                            however, another and additional cause of ill-will, and you will readily
                            comprehend that I hope that my suggestion may be promptly adopted. We
                            are receiving alternate accounts of defeats and successes during the
                            retreat upon Chalons, and to-day General Trochu, just appointed governor
                            of Paris, has issued his proclamation calling upon all good citizens to
                            preserve their fortitude and prepare for the worst in the presence of a
                            foreign foe. At the same time the journals are filled with accounts of
                            the instructions issued for provisioning the city to stand a siege. In
                            the light of the foregoing information, you will perceive that I must
                            necessarily be unwilling to continue to be responsible for such public
                            funds in my safe, and you will immediately recognize the propriety of
                            giving me authority to bank with some responsible house.</p>
                        <p>The safe furnished by the Government is in peaceful times very insecure,
                            and in times like these it affords no adequate protection whatever.</p>
                        <p>Many French citizens have applied to me for protection, and also have
                            asked me to guard their valuables; but I have respectfully declined to
                            receive anything into my keeping belonging to French subjects, feeling
                            that unless I adopted this rule I could not do justice to my own
                            countrymen and women. I have made one exception in favor of the
                            grand-daughters of the Marquis de Lafayette, telling them, at the same
                            time, that it must be at their own risk.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your four telegrams of the 18th and 19th instant, and to
                            inform you that I have instructed all the consuls within my jurisdiction
                            in accordance with the directions therein contained.</p>
                        <p>In fixing upon rates of discount, owing to the fluctuations from day to
                            day and hour to hour, I have thought best to place them a trifle above
                            the highest limits yet readied, as I would thus secure the Government
                            against probable loss. Of course I will account rigidly to the <pb
                                n="147" xml:id="pg_147" facs="0181"/>Government for every centime
                            received, and will turn over the small surplus, if any there be, to the
                            Treasury Department.</p>
                        <p>The whole subject is a very delicate and harassing one, for the French
                            people at this moment, very naturally, are in a similar state of
                            excitement to that which prevailed in the United States during the
                            rebellion, and they are prone to see in the smallest things infractions
                            upon their honor as a nation, where no disrespect is intended or
                            imagined. Thus, for example, they argue that for the United States
                            Government to refuse to take silver or Bank of France notes, except at a
                            discount, in this time of their sore distress, is to impugn their
                            national honor. That the true plan is for the Government of the United
                            States to receive silver and bank notes at par, and after the war is
                            over to make a reclamation upon the French government for the amount
                            lost by so doing.</p>
                        <p>I feel it my duty to state the exact situation of affairs, and to report
                            the opinions expressed to me by many of the leading men here in commerce
                            and public affairs. No explanation seems to them satisfactory, and I
                            find myself placed in a very unpleasant position thereby, at a critical
                            time, when it is desirable to cultivate the kindly feelings of the
                            people. My instructions, however, are so clear and unmistakable that I
                            have no hesitation as to the course which I will pursue.</p>
                        <p>I have to-day received from the consul general of the North German
                            Confederation at London, a request to inclose to each of the United
                            States consuls circulars asking them to forward immediately all
                            information concerning German vessels and their crews, which may be
                            brought into port by French cruisers. I have directed the consuls to
                            communicate to me all such intelligence, and upon its receipt I will
                            immediately advise the German consul general at London.</p>
                        <p>Trusting that the Department will approve my action in the above
                            particulars, I have only to add that the dispatches this day received
                            for the consul at Strasburg cannot at present be forwarded to him, as
                            all communications are cut, and that city is besieged. It is reported
                            this evening that the Prussians are in the vicinity of Chalons, on their
                            way to Paris. It is impossible to ascertain the truth or falsity of this
                            rumor, as no information can be obtained from the department, but I am
                            inclined to doubt it for the moment.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> Your dispatch No. 56 is received.</p>
                        <p>The questions in regard to the receipt of fees, in currency or in specie,
                            and to the daily deposit of them in a bank, are supposed to have been
                            satisfactorily answered by the cable. Full copies of the telegrams are
                            inclosed.</p>
                        <p>If the extra labor put upon you by the care of the North German
                            consulates renders necessary an extra force, you will employ such as is
                            necessary, keeping a separate memorandum account of all expenditures in
                            that behalf for the use of this Department hereafter.</p>
                        <p>The items will also go into your usual and ordinary accounts. The
                            Department relies on your prudence to keep these extraordinary expenses
                            within reasonable bounds.</p>
                        <pb n="148" xml:id="pg_148" facs="0182"/>
                        <p>Your course in refusing to receive the property of French subjects for
                            protection is approved. If the protection sought is against the act of
                            France or of the French authorities, the rendering it would be an
                            infringement of the last clause of the third article of the consular
                            convention, concluded with France in 1853. If it is intended to be used
                            against the North Germans, the granting it is a violation of the
                            neutrality which we should observe in this war.</p>
                        <p>You intimate that citizens of the United States in Paris may apply to
                            have their property lodged at the consulate for protection. As the
                            receipt of such property may invole you in personal liability to the
                            owners, unless you carefully guard yourself against it, the Department
                            does not feel inclined to give you instructions which can be construed
                            as requiring you to receive it.</p>
                        <p>Should you receive it, you will be careful to state officially in writing
                            to each party that the Government will assume no risk in the custody of
                            the property and no obligation to return it. A consulate is not
                            established in a foreign country to be a storehouse of property in time
                            of war. But if parties are willing to take upon themselves, so far as
                            the Government is concerned, the entire risk of the safe-keeping and
                            return of small articles which can be deposited in a consulate without
                            interfering with the official business, the Department will be glad to
                            see them accommodated, if it is an accommodation to them to be permitted
                            to make deposit of such sort of property.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your dispatch No. 60, with inclosed copies of telegrams
                            forwarded to me by the Department. I have the honor also to reply to the
                            instructions contained in your dispatch, as follows:</p>
                        <p>1. The several dispatches and telegram have enabled me to satisfactorily
                            arrange the monetary affairs connected with this consulate general.</p>
                        <p>2. The Department may feel entirely sure that I will keep the
                            extraordinary expenses connected with the care of the North German
                            consulate “within reasonable bounds,” and that, while using my utmost
                            personal exertions, I will carefully abstain from creating or allowing
                            any unnecessary expenditures whatever.</p>
                        <p>3. I have declined in every instance to receive the property of French
                            citizens, except that in the case of the grandson of the Marquis de
                            Lafayette I consented to take charge of certain relics of that
                            illustrious Frenchman, in remembrance of the services which he had
                            rendered to our country when she was struggling for her liberty. But I
                            distinctly informed Mr. de Lafayette that these matters were deposited
                            in this consulate general at his own risk.</p>
                        <pb n="149" xml:id="pg_149" facs="0183"/>
                        <p>4. I have received the valuables of certain American citizens, most of
                            whom were ladies, and who had no one to whom they could turn for
                            protection. But I have notified each person in writing that they
                            deposited their effects in the consulate general at their own risk, and
                            that neither the Government nor the consul general would or could accept
                            any responsibility in thus receiving them.</p>
                        <p>While taking the utmost care to relieve the Government of all
                            responsibility and myself from personal liability, I have spared no
                            pains to defend and protect the property of American citizens. As a
                            means to this end I have placed in several newspapers a notice
                            requesting all Americans, resident in Paris, to come to this consulate
                            general and register their names, their addresses in this city, with a
                            slight description of the character of their property, and also their
                            exact addresses in the United States. With this record at hand, I will
                            be enabled to give a certain sort of useful information to their
                            relatives or representatives, in case of loss of property or life.</p>
                        <p>I had the honor to address to you on the 12th instant the following
                            telegram:</p>

                            approved.</p>
                        <p>The Prussians are very near Paris, and it is possible that no mails after
                            to day will reach their destination.</p>
                        <p>Referring to my determination heretofore expressed, I wish the Department
                            to distinctly understand that I shall remain here not only in ease of a
                            siege, but also in case the city is bombarded. In my judgment it is my
                            duty to adopt this course, and I shall have no hesitation in doing
                            so.</p>
                        <p>In view of the immediate possibility and necessity of providing places of
                            refuge for American citizens in times of danger and popular tumult, I
                            have established branch offices of this consulate general at my
                            residence in the Avenue d’Antin, and at the residence of the vice-consul
                            general in the Place de Batignolles. It gives me the utmost pleasure to
                            state that, in all my efforts in this and in every other direction, I
                            have the faithful coöperation of Mr. Olcott, vice-consul general, Mr.
                            Thirion, consular clerk and secretary, and Mr. David T. S. Fuller, clerk
                            and messenger.</p>

                            of 1853. It is, to say the least, doubtful whether, the right to
                            establish agencies, (or branches,) conferred by Article V, should be
                            construed as conferring the right to establish several offices in the

                        <p>The Department advises you to communicate freely with Mr. Washburne on
                            these subjects, and to so act as not to bring us in conflict with the

                                in any part of his Majesty’s dominions beyond the seas, without the

                                are at peace, the duties of neutrality; and to respect, in all and
                                each of them, the exercise of those belligerent rights which we and
                                our royal predecessors have always claimed to exercise.</p>
                            <p>And we do hereby further warn all our loving subjects, and all

                                shall presume, in contempt of this our royal proclamation, and of
                                our high displeasure, to do any acts in derogation of their duty as
                                subjects of a neutral sovereign in a war between other sovereigns,
                                or in violation or contravention of the law of nations in that
                                behalf, as more especially by breaking, or endeavoring to break, any
                                blockade lawfully and actually established by or on behalf of either
                                of the said sovereigns, by carrying officers, soldiers, dispatches,
                                arms, ammunition, military stores or materials, or any article or
                                articles considered and deemed to be contraband of war according to
                                the law or modern usages of nations, for the use or service of
                                either of the said sovereigns, that all persons so offending,
                                together with their ships and goods, will rightfully incur and be
                                justly liable to hostile capture, and to the penalties denounced by
                                the law of nations in that behalf.</p>
                            <p>And we do hereby give notice that all our subjects and persons
                                entitled to our protection who may misconduct themselves in the
                                premises will do so at their peril, and of their own wrong; and that
                                they will in nowise obtain any protection from us against such
                                capture, or such penalties as aforesaid, but will, on the contrary,
                                incur our high displeasure by such misconduct.</p>

                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Attorney General.</hi> I have to move the second
                            reading of a bill of great importance, the object of which is what the
                            late debate has shown to be the general wish of both sides of the House,
                            namely, the preservation of the neutrality of this country. I do not
                            propose to enter into the discussion of any vexed questions of
                            international law. I do not propose to discuss the extent to which a
                            neutral country can be required by a foreign belligerent to interfere to
                            prevent her subjects from taking part in hostile preparations. I do not
                            propose to discuss what municipal laws, if any, she can be required to
                            enact, to what extent she can be Compelled to enforce them, or for what
                            neglect to enforce them she can be held responsible. I do not propose to
                            discuss these questions because, though her Majesty’s government are
                            most anxious to discharge all their obligations of neutrality, still it
                            is well it should be understood that the main object of this bill is not
                            so much to satisfy any demands which foreign nations may be entitled to
                            make against us, but rather to satisfy ourselves [hear] to maintain the
                            honor and dignity of the Crown, which are compromised when the subjects
                            of the Queen take part in hostilities against an ally, and to avoid not
                            merely all causes of offense, but, if possible, all cause of discussion
                            with foreign countries. In a word, her Majesty’s government have been
                            less careful to ascertain what foreign nations would be entitled to
                            require from us than what we consider due to ourselves, to our own
                            dignity, and our own self-respect. It may be that the provisions of our
                            present foreign enlistment act are as strong as can be required of us by
                            a belligerent ally—perhaps even stronger. But I think it will be
                            generally agreed that they are not strong enough to satisfy ourselves,
                            and we desire they should be made more stringent. I shall not enter into
                            the Alabama question. The Alabama escaped by a stratagem which we could
                            not foresee, and which, as we maintain, could not be prevented by
                            ordinary care in the then existing state of our law. We deny that we are
                            responsible to the American Government for the escape of the Alabama,
                            though we are willing to submit that question to arbitration. But,
                            whatever the issue in that case, I believe there is no man in this House
                            who does not regret the escape of the Alabama, [cheers,] and I am
                            willing to hope that that regret is shared even by the authors of the
                            calamity. [Hear, hear.] I trust there is not a man in this House who
                            does not desire that, measures should be taken, if it be practicable, to
                            make the escape of future Alabamas impossible. [Hear, bear.] I need not
                            dwell upon the failures—for I fear I must call them such—of the attempts
                            by the government to enforce the foreign enlistment act. We all know
                            that a suit was instituted against the Alexandra, and although it
                            appeared that that vessel had been built for the confederate government,
                            and was to a certain extent equipped for their service, still the late
                            chief baron directed the jury that, because she was not so completely
                            equipped as to be in a condition to commence hostilities when she left
                            our ports, therefore the foreign enlistment act did not apply; and on
                            appeal to the court of exchequer the court was divided in opinion. I
                            believe the ruling to have been wrong, though I am not entitled to say
                            so, the court having been divided; but if the law was rightly laid down
                            by the chief baron, that law ought to be amended, and no other Alexandra
                            ought to be allowed to escape. I need not name the steam rams which Lord
                            Russell undertook to stop, acting within the powers of the law. We
                            recollect that the proceedings of Lord Russell were seriously impeached
                            in this House, and that upon a division, nominally for papers, but
                            really amounting to a vote of censure, his conduct in stopping the steam
                            rams was approved by comparatively a small majority. These
                            considerations point to an amendment of the law, and I have reason to
                            suppose that considerations such as these induced the government of Lord
                            Derby to appoint a commission in 1868, consisting of men of the greatest
                            possible eminence, who made a very valuable report. It was the intention
                            of the government to propose a bill some time since, carrying into
                            effect the recommendations in that report. The bill gave way to other
                            measures which then appeared more pressing; but I think the House will
                            agree that, upon the breaking out of this unexpected and most calamitous
                            war, her Majesty’s government would have been very much to blame if they
                            had delayed for a single day to introduce this measure. [Hear, hear.]
                            The bill is founded on the report of a royal commission. I am quite sure
                            that there is no class in the community more patriotic or more desirous
                            than the mercantile classes are of maintaining peace and neutrality. We
                            must not, however, disguise from ourselves that there are a set of
                            unscrupulous traders—men who seem to have proposed to themselves no
                            object but that of private gain, and who will endeavor to evade the
                            provisions of any foreign enlistment act which we may pass. It is
                            necessary, therefore, in order to meet the subterfuges with which we may
                            expect to have to deal, that the law should be stringent. I shall now
                            proceed to state very shortly the main provisions of the bill. With
                            respect to enlistment, the provisions of the bill are very much the same
                            as those of the existing act; but they are, I think, expressed in
                            clearer language—a not very difficult task to accomplish, for the
                            present foreign enlistment act is not a good specimen of draughting.
                            Generally speaking, the provisions with respect to enlistment apply to
                            all British subjects in all parts of the world, and to aliens only
                            within the Queen’s <pb n="154" xml:id="pg_154" facs="0188"/>dominions.
                            There are provisions against enlisting persons under false
                            representations, as in the case of those who engaged Irish navvies to go
                            to America, where they were enlisted in the federal service. There is a
                            penalty for taking persons illegally on board ship, and a power to
                            detain the ship, accompanied, however, by a power to release her on
                            security being given. I now come to deal with the question of the
                            equipment and fitting out of vessels, with respect to which there has
                            been so much litigation. To this section of the act a very important
                            addition has been suggested by the commissioners, to the effect that it
                            should apply not merely to the arming and equipping, but to the building
                            of a ship. That recommendation was made by all the commissioners, with
                            the exception of my honorable and learned friend, the member for whose
                            authority I have the greatest respect, although I think that he, in the
                            present instance, was wrong, and that the majority of the commissioners
                            were right. If such a provision were contained in the existing act, the
                            Alabama could not have escaped, and the Alexandra must have been
                            condemned. It obviously is very unsatisfactory for a government to be
                            aware that a vessel is being built for a belligerent, to know her
                            destination, to have to wait day after day till she is completed, and
                            then one fine morning to find that she is gone. Now, that has frequently
                            occurred, and it is desirable that it should not occur again. There is
                            also a provision in this section which touches the case of a mere
                            dispatch of a vessel, and a clause containing a provision to the effect
                            that if it is shown that a vessel has been ordered to be built for a
                            belligerent, and is supplied to that belligerent and used for warlike
                            purposes, that shall be held to be <hi rend="italic">prima facie</hi>
                            evidence that she was built for the warlike service of the belligerent,
                            unless the innocent destination of the vessel can be established. In a
                            provision of that kind there is, I apprehend, no hardship. The
                            commissioners also recommended, and we have adopted that part of their
                            report, that proceedings should be taken in the court of admiralty
                            rather than the court of exchequer. It is provided, therefore, that
                            suits for the condemnation of vessels offending against the act shall be
                            instituted in the court of admiralty. I have now to call attention to a
                            very important power which we propose to give by the bill. It is the
                            power which it confers on the secretary of state, on his being satisfied
                            that a vessel is being built or equipped for the service of a foreign
                            belligerent, and is about to be dispatched, to issue his warrant
                            ordering her to be detained, which warrant is to be laid on the table of
                            the House. It is further provided that the owner of a vessel may apply
                            to the court of admiralty for her release, which he may obtain if he
                            satisfies the court that her destination was lawful; and not only may he
                            obtain her release, but damages for her retention. In order to prevent
                            any hardship, there is, moreover, a provision that the admiralty shall
                            release the vessel on a bond being given that she was not to be employed
                            on any illegal adventure. There is another provision in respect to which
                            the bill, I admit, goes beyond the recommendation of the commissioners.
                            It gives power to the local authorities named in it to seize a vessel if
                            they have reason to, suppose she is about to escape; but then they will
                            have to report immediately the seizure to the secretary of state, who
                            will be empowered at once to release her, should he be of opinion that
                            there were not sufficient grounds for the seizure; and, assuming the
                            vessel to have been seized without reasonable cause, and released by the
                            secretary of state, the owner will be entitled to claim damages for the
                            detention. These are the provisions by which we propose to attain the
                            object which we have in view, and to render extremely difficult, if not
                            almost impracticable, the escape of any such vessel as the Alexandra or
                            the Alabama in future. There is, besides, a provision against augmenting
                            the force of a belligerent vessel in our ports, and one to the effect
                            that a vessel illegally built shall not be received in our ports. This
                            is a provision which we have introduced in conformity with the
                            recommendation of the commission, but I am bound to say it appears to me
                            somewhat questionable whether it is not desirable to leave the matter to
                            be dealt with by regulations to be laid down by the government, rather
                            than deal with it in acts of Parliament. The bill, I may add, contains a
                            prohibition against fitting out naval and military expeditions, and
                            another, which is new to our law, but which is acted upon by all the
                            American courts, to the effect that prizes captured by a vessel
                            illegally fitted out, if brought into our ports, shall be restored to
                            the owners. These are the principal provisions of the bill, but, in
                            consequence of some misapprehension which seems to prevail, I wish, if
                            the House will permit me, to say a few words with respect to certain
                            provisions which some persons think ought to be contained in the bill,
                            but which are not. I allude to provisions to prevent the exportation of
                            contraband of war. Those who entertain misapprehensions on this score I
                            would refer to a letter signed “Historicus,” which appeared in the Times
                            of Saturday, and which contains a clear and correct expression of the
                            law on the subject. But as some honorable members may not have seen that
                            letter, I will make a few remarks by way of explanation on the point.
                            The government of this country does not undertake, and has not
                            undertaken in former wars, to prohibit the exportation of contraband of
                            war. The exportation of contraband of war is not prohibited by the
                            existing enlistment act, nor, strictly speaking, by the Queen’s
                            proclamation. On this subject, however, it appears to me that a good
                            deal of misapprehension exists. Some people seem to think that the Queen
                            could, by her proclamation, constitute a <pb n="155" xml:id="pg_155"
                                facs="0189"/>new offense against the law of the land, but to suppose
                            that would be tantamount to supposing that the Queen could exercise the
                            functions of the whole legislature. No proclamation of the Queen can
                            constitute that an offense against an act of Parliament, or the law of
                            the land, which was not an offense before; and if honorable members will
                            carefully read the recent proclamation, they will find that the effect
                            of it is as follows: It draws their attention, in the first place, to
                            certain provisions of the foreign enlistment act which prohibit the
                            furnishing of ships of war, &amp;c., to belligerents, and it indicates
                            that any offense against those provisions will be a criminal and
                            indictable offense. The proclamation proceeds to warn her Majesty’s
                            subjects, first, against the breaking of blockades, and, secondly,
                            against the supplying of contraband of war; but the consequence of
                            disobeying these injunctions of the Queen are pointed out to be a
                            liability to hostile capture. That is the liability, and the only
                            liability, which is pointed out in the proclamation. The government have
                            not undertaken to prevent vessels from breaking the blockade, nor to
                            prevent the exportation of contraband of war, but they say to any man
                            who starts with a vessel intending to break the blockade or to supply
                            contraband of war to a belligerent: “You do it at your own risk; you
                            will be subject to capture, and the Queen will not interfere for your
                            protection.’’ That is the consequence of which those people are warned
                            who contravene the provisions of the foreign enlistment act. I think it
                            well that this should be generally understood, because many complaints
                            are made against the government for not preventing the exportation of
                            coal, of horses, of a variety of articles which may or may not be
                            contraband of war. Let us see what has been our practice in former wars.
                            During the Crimean war, for example, Belgium and Holland supplied Russia
                            with large quantities of arms, but we did not treat that as a breach of
                            neutrality. Again, during the American war large quantities of arms,
                            ammunition, and other contraband of war were supplied by us both to the
                            federals and the confederates, but although the former complained of us
                            for having allowed the Alabama to escape, they made no complaint that we
                            did not undertake to prevent the exportation of contraband of war. They
                            merely captured the vessels when they could catch them. Therefore,
                            provisions to prevent the exportation of contraband of war are not to be
                            found in this bill any more than they are to be found in our existing
                            act or in the American act. This, however, ought to be known. If it be
                            shown that a vessel carrying coal or any other contraband article is so
                            far in communication and correspondence with the fleet of either
                            belligerent as to form a part of it, or acts as a tender to ships of
                            war, such vessel will run the risk of being captured and forfeited as a,
                            store-ship in the service of the enemy. It is true that under the
                            customs consolidation act the Queen may stop the exportation of arms by
                            an order in council, but that provision has never been enforced except
                            when we ourselves were actually engaged or were on the point of engaging
                            in war. I admit that this bill goes beyond the American act. Indeed, as
                            far as I am aware, it goes beyond any statute law passed in any country
                            for the purpose of enforcing neutrality. If we bad merely considered the
                            strict measure of international duties which might have been forced upon
                            us, probably we should not have gone so far; but the bill has been
                            prepared for the sake of ourselves and of our dignity rather than in
                            order to satisfy any demands which might be made upon us by foreign
                            countries. Although some of its provisions against reckless and
                            unscrupulous traders may be stringent, I think none will interfere with
                            the objects of legitimate commerce. At all events, the bill has been
                            prepared with much care and consideration by the government with the
                            object of promoting what both sides of the House profess to desire,
                            namely, the preservation of the neutrality of this country and the peace
                            and tranquillity of Europe. It has been prepared with that object, and
                            I, therefore, confidently venture to submit it to the candid
                            consideration of both sides of the House. [Hear, hear.] The honorable
                            and learned gentleman concluded by moving the second reading of the
                            bill.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Staveley Hill</hi> cordially indorsed all the
                            reasons adduced by his honorable and learned friend in favor of the
                            bill, as this country certainly ought to endeavor by every means to
                            maintain itself as a neutral state. Above all things, it was necessary
                            to prevent the recurrence of what happened during the American war, and,
                            consequently, we ought not to allow England to be made the starting
                            point of a ship of war which, as had been aptly remarked, was an
                            expedition in itself. In his opinion, the present measure should carry
                            out the spirit of the foreign enlistment act passed in the reign of
                            George III, but ought not to go so far as in any way to cripple our
                            ship-building trade. It ought not to prevent our ship-builders from
                            carrying on their trade simply because some of the vessels they
                            constructed might be used in war against or by a friendly power. The
                            eighth clause went too far when it provided that any person within her
                            Majesty’s dominions should be deemed guilty of an offense who built or
                            agreed to build any ship if be bad reasonable cause to believe that it
                            would be employed by any foreign state at war with any friendly state.
                            In his judgment, the clause ought to be limited in its operation by the
                            insertion of words to the effect that it should be an offense to build
                            the vessels after the declaration of war. The fifth clause affected all
                            persons leaving her Majesty’s dominions with the intention of entering
                            the service of a foreign state, and the House would, perhaps, learn with
                            considerable surprise that <pb n="156" xml:id="pg_156" facs="0190"
                            />under that clause a penalty would be inflicted on an American subject
                            who quitted these shores in order to serve in the French army. The
                            circumstance of the court of exchequer having decided the Alabama case
                            against the Crown was not a sufficient reason for transferring the
                            jurisdiction in such cases to the judge of the admiralty court. In
                            conclusion, he expressed approval of the bill generally, but hoped it
                            would be so amended as to keep the country thoroughly neutral when it
                            was so designed by the government.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Vernon</hi> H<hi rend="smallcaps">arcourt</hi>
                            was glad that an atmosphere of neutrality at length pervaded the Houses
                            He rejoiced at the appearance of this measure, notwithstanding the tardy
                            action of the government respecting the matter with which it dealt. No
                            one would differ from Lord Russell’s dictum, that the case of the
                            Alabama was a scandal to the law of this country, and that those
                            concerned in that disastrous fraud committed one of the most unpatriotic
                            acts of which an Englishman had ever been found guilty He was glad to
                            hear from the attorney general that the bill could not be regarded as a
                            bill founded upon international obligations; it went far beyond any such
                            obligations; it was a bill to restrain private warfare against a nation
                            with which the sovereign was at peace. He was sure the honorable and
                            learned member for Richmond and the vice-president of the committee of
                            council would agree with him in the opinion that it would have been
                            better if the preventive portion of the bill had been enlarged, and that
                            so much had not been made of the punitive portion, because punishment
                            was useful only as a deterrent, but prevention was of far greater
                            consequence. Besides, if great weight was placed upon the punitive
                            portions of the bill, foreign powers would be continually complaining of
                            our not prosecuting sufficiently. The action of a jury, too, was
                            necessary in the case of punishment, and juries might be unwilling to
                            give a verdict against a prisoner. He regretted the bill had not been
                            introduced earlier, that it might be revised by a select committee.
                            Among other things he noticed with regret that the power held by the
                            executive to dispense with the operation of the foreign enlistment act
                            had not been dispensed with. This power would enable a government, as
                            was said by Canning, “to sneak the country into a war which they had not
                            the courage to declare,” a most dangerous power for any government to
                            possess. As regards clause 5, he agreed with the honorable and learned
                            member for Coventry that we should not control foreigners as regards
                            their object in leaving this country. Clause 6, which proposed to punish
                            those who induced others to enlist in a foreign army, was a very useful
                            one, and was directed against crimps and others who got hold of innocent
                            sailors, and when they got them to sea endeavored to persuade them to
                            sign articles. That clause, however, concluded by a singular paragraph,
                            to the effect that if a man taken abroad should ultimately enlist in a
                            foreign service it should be deemed conclusively that he quitted her
                            Majesty’s dominions with the intent to accept as engagement in the
                            military or naval service of such foreign state. In his opinion, the
                            clause would be sufficiently strong without that paragraph. The eighth
                            clause had reference to the illegal building of ships, and, in his
                            opinion, it was open to considerable difficulty. If the government took
                            upon itself to forbid the building of vessels of any particular
                            description they would make themselves responsible for every keel laid
                            in this country, and the representatives of foreign nations would be
                            constantly urging them to interfere in a manner calculated to materially
                            check our ship-building trade, on the ground that nearly every vessel
                            that was being built might be intended for a purpose adverse to the
                            interests of the country in whose service they were. The private ship
                            building trade in this country was a most important one, as it afforded
                            us in time of war splendid dockyards, which cost us nothing to maintain
                            in time of peace, and he warned the House against passing, he would not
                            say in a moment of panic, but without a sufficient amount of
                            consideration, any measure which was calculated to drive away that
                            trade, and thereby to give to foreign nations the advantages which it at
                            present afforded us in the shape of the private dock-yards to which he
                            had alluded. All that was necessary in order to carry out the intention
                            of the measure was to prevent the dispatch of the vessel when built, and
                            not to prevent it being built, and he thought that that object was fully
                            provided for by another clause in the bill. Under clause 7, which
                            supplemented the provisions of clause 6, if any American were to leave
                            this country for America by one of the Cunard Company’s ships, and were
                            subsequently to enter the service of any of the states of South America,
                            the captain of the ship so carrying him would be liable to two years’
                            imprisonment. That would be stretching the law to a most injudicious
                            extent, because he did not think that Parliament had a right to inquire
                            into the motives of any foreigner when he left these shores, and because
                            he thought that it was absurd to say that the captain of a vessel
                            conveying him should be responsible for what was concealed in the mind
                            of the foreigner during the voyage. He trusted, therefore, that the
                            honorable and learned gentleman would consent to strike that clause out
                            of the bill. The attorney general had stated that it was his intention
                            to strike out clause 11, which was intended to prevent the hospitality
                            of our ports being extended to vessels that had illegally left this
                            country, on the ground that he thought its object would be better
                            carried out by means of a regulation to be enforced by the executive. He
                            entirely agreed with the necessity that existed for the enforcement of
                            some such regulation, <pb n="157" xml:id="pg_157" facs="0191"/>because
                            he believed that had the Alabama been excluded from our ports after she
                            bad escaped from this country, the difficulties that bad arisen between
                            this country and America in reference to that vessel would have been
                            avoided. He thought that if the alterations he had suggested were made
                            in the measure it would be a far better bill than it was at present.
                            [Hear.]</p>
                        <p>Sir <hi rend="smallcaps">Roundell Palmer</hi> was glad that the House was
                            so nearly agreed upon the importance of and the necessity for passing
                            this measure. It was most desirable that the statement of the attorney
                            general, that a nation was not bound by international law to legislate
                            upon this subject, should be thoroughly understood and generally known.
                            In fact, it was only in this country and in the United States that such
                            legislation had occurred, although no doubt in many continental nations
                            there were elastic powers in force which enabled the various governments
                            to deal with cases of the description referred to in the bill, when they
                            happened to arise. All subjects of the country owed to the government
                            the duty of being neutral when the state was neutral, and it was the
                            duty of the state to arm itself with powers to repress any attempt on
                            the part of private citizens to oppose the public will to be neutral.
                            His honorable and learned friend the member for Oxford had suggested
                            that the House should seize the opportunity of doing what was not done
                            by the existing foreign enlistment act, and should take from the Crown
                            the power of granting a license to do any acts which, under the foreign
                            enlistment act, would be illegal if done without the license of the
                            Crown; but to legislate to deprive the Crown of the power of taking a
                            single step of that kind, without going to war altogether, would be
                            imprudent and foreign to the purposes of the present bill, for there
                            might be many cases in which it would be inexpedient to enter upon war,
                            though the state did not assume an attitude of strict neutrality. A
                            matter of high policy of that kind ought not to be dealt with by a
                            side-wind in such a bill as the present. The fifth clause related to
                            persons leaving this country to enlist in the service of a belligerent
                            whose subjects they were not, and if it were expedient to retain such a
                            clause, it was also expedient that the Crown should have the power of
                            relaxing its operation. And so with regard to the important case of
                            ship-building; if a power of relaxation was not given to the Crown,
                            there would be involved in the penalties of the bill any person who took
                            a contract to build a ship before the commencement of war, and yet might
                            be willing afterward to go to the government and ask for a license,
                            undertaking, at the same time, not to allow the ship to leave the
                            country. With regard to the seventh clause, they must consider not
                            merely the case of the solitary American alluded to by the honorable
                            member from Oxford, but must look at the larger case. There was in this
                            country a great number of foreigners of various nations, and it could
                            not be maintained that the principle of neutrality would be observed if
                            a recruiting sergeant were allowed to go through the country to enlist
                            persons for the service of a foreign state of which they were not the
                            subjects. With regard to the clause respecting illegal ship-building, he
                            was of opinion that if the power conferred by that clause were not given
                            the bill would be emasculated. He thought it of infinitely greater
                            importance that all ship-builders and traders in this country should
                            obey the law with respect to the neutrality of their country than that
                            they should have a few contracts on their hands more or less. [Hear,
                            hear.]</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Samuda</hi> feared that much mischief would be
                            done to the large and important ship-building industry of the country if
                            this bill were allowed to pass in its present form. He thought the whole
                            objects of the bill might be obtained by the fourth subsection of the
                            eighth clause, omitting all the others, avoiding, all restrictions on
                            shipbuilding, and only requiring stringent securities that the vessels
                            should not be dispatched without a certificate from the foreign
                            secretary.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Rathbone</hi> thanked the government, in the
                            name of the mercantile community, for introducing this bill, which only
                            carried out the policy which the ship-owners of Liverpool passed on the
                            government of the day very soon after the escape of the Alabama. The
                            mercantile community would give their utmost support to the government
                            in maintaining a faithful and true neutrality.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Bourke</hi> supported the second reading of the
                            bill, but regretted that it had not been introduced at an earlier period
                            of the session, and that we should now have the appearance of
                            legislating to meet special circumstances, though the provisions had
                            been matured in a time of profound peace. At the same time Earl Russell
                            was among the many distinguished persons who had formerly been of
                            opinion that the foreign enlistment act was sufficient for the purpose.
                            The practice of neutrality was in many respects very embarrassing from
                            the fact that this country had become the arsenal, dock-yard, and
                            workshop for every nation in the world; and the man who delivered a
                            thousand rifles to one of the belligerent nations infringed the
                            principle of strict neutrality as much, in his opinion, as the man who
                            built them a ship. While, therefore, he agreed that further legislation
                            was necessary, he recommended the government to rely more on the
                            preventive than the punitive clauses, and not to attach a brand of
                            criminality to the acts of ship-owners, while others were allowed to go
                            free.</p>
                        <p>Lord <hi rend="smallcaps">Bury</hi> could not see in the fact that war
                            was raging on the continent any reason for not amending our municipal
                            law in points where this was notoriously defective.</p>

                        <p>Sixteenth. Any offense against this act shall, for all purposes of and
                            incidental to the trial and punishment of any person guilty of any such
                            offense, be deemed to have been committed either in the place in which
                            the offense was wholly or partly committed, or in any place within her
                            Majesty’s dominions in which the person who committed such offense may
                            be.</p>
                        <p>Seventeenth. Any offense against this act may be described in any
                            indictment or other document relating to such offense, in cases where
                            the mode of trial requires such a description, as having been committed
                            at the place where it was wholly or partly committed, or it may be
                            averred generally to have been committed within her Majesty’s dominions,
                            and the venue or local description in the margin may be that of the
                            county, city, or place in which the trial is held.</p>
                        <p>Eighteenth. The following authorities, that is to say, in the United

                            jurisdiction of any British court of justice, such court, or, if there
                            are more courts than one, the court having the highest criminal
                            jurisdiction in that place, may, by warrant or instrument in the nature
                            of a warrant in this section included in the term “warrant,” direct that
                            any offender charged with an offense against this act shall be removed
                            to some other place in her Majesty’s dominions for trial in cases where
                            it appears to the authority granting the warrant that the removal of
                            such offender would be conducive to the interests of justice, and any
                            prisoner so removed shall be triable at the place to which he is
                            removed, in the same manner as if his offense had been committed at such
                            place.</p>
                        <p>Any warrant for the purposes of this section may be addressed to the
                            master of any ship or to any other person or persons, and the person or
                            persons to whom such warrant is addressed shall have power to convey the
                            prisoner therein named to any place or places named in such warrant, and
                            to deliver him, when arrived at such place or places, into the custody
                            of any authority designated by such warrant.</p>
                        <p>Every prisoner shall, during the time of his removal under any such
                            warrant as aforesaid, be deemed to be in the legal custody of the person
                            or persons empowered to remove him.</p>
                        <p>Nineteenth. All proceedings for the condemnation and forfeiture of a
                            ship, or ship and equipment, or arms and munitions of war, in pursuance
                            of this act shall require the sanction of the secretary of state or such
                            chief executive authority as is in this act <pb n="161" xml:id="pg_161"
                                facs="0195"/>mentioned, and shall be had in the court of admiralty,
                            and not in any other court; and the court of admiralty shall, in
                            addition to any power given to the court by this act, have in respect of
                            any ship or other matter brought before it in pursuance of this act all
                            powers which it has in the case of a ship or matter brought before it in
                            the exercise of its ordinary jurisdiction.</p>
                        <p>Twentieth. Where any offense against this act has been committed by any
                            person by reason whereof a ship, or ship and equipment, or arms and
                            munitions of war, has or have become liable to forfeiture, proceedings
                            may be instituted contemporaneously or not, as may be thought fit,
                            against the offender in any court having jurisdiction of the offense,
                            and against the ship, or ship and equipment, or arms and munitions of
                            war, for the forfeiture in the court of admiralty; but it shall not be
                            necessary to take proceedings against the offender because proceedings
                            are instituted for the forfeiture, or to take proceedings for the
                            forfeiture because proceedings are taken against the offender.</p>
                        <p>Twenty-first. The following officers, that is to say, 1. Any officer of
                            customs in the United Kingdom, subject nevertheless to any special or
                            general instructions from the commissioners of customs or any officer of
                            the Board of Trade, subject nevertheless to any special or general
                            instructions from the Board of Trade. 2. Any officer of customs or

                            his commanding officer. 4. Any commissioned officer on full pay in the
                            naval service of the Crown, subject nevertheless to any special or
                            general instructions from the admiralty or his superior officer, may
                            seize or detain any ship liable to be seized or detained in pursuance of
                            this act, and such officers are in this act referred to as the “local
                            authority;” but nothing in this act contained shall derogate from the
                            power of the court of admiralty to direct any ship to be seized or
                            detained by any officer by whom such court may have power under its
                            ordinary jurisdiction to direct a ship to be seized or detained.</p>
                        <p>Twenty-second. Any officer authorized to seize or detain any ship in
                            respect of any offense against, this act may, for the purpose of
                            enforcing such seizure or detention, call to his aid any constable or
                            officers of police, or any officers of her Majesty’s army or navy or
                            marines, or any excise officers or officers of customs, or any

                            make seizures of ships, and may put-on board any ship so seized or
                            detained any one or more of such officers to take charge of the same,
                            and to enforce the provisions of this act, and any officer seizing or
                            detaining any ship under this act may use force, if necessary, for the
                            purpose of enforcing seizure or detention, and if any person is killed
                            or maimed by reason of his resisting such officer in the execution of
                            his duties, or any person acting under his orders, such officer so
                            seizing or detaining the ship, or other person, shall be freely and
                            fully indemnified as well against the Queen’s Majesty, her heirs and
                            successors, as against all persons so killed, maimed, or hurt.</p>
                        <p>Twenty-third. If the secretary of state or the chief executive authority
                            is satisfied that there is a reasonable and probable cause for believing
                            that a ship within her Majesty’s dominions has been or is being built,
                            commissioned, or equipped contrary to this act, and is about to be taken
                            beyond the limits of such dominions, or that a ship is about to be
                            dispatched contrary to this act, such secretary of state or chief
                            executive authority shall have power to issue a warrant stating that
                            there is reasonable and probable cause for believing as aforesaid, and
                            upon such warrant the local authority shall have power to seize and
                            search such ship, and to detain the same until it has been either
                            condemned or released by process of law, or in manner hereinafter
                            mentioned. The owner of the ship so detained, or his agent, may apply to
                            the court of admiralty for its release, and the court shall as soon as
                            possible put the matter of such seizure and detention in course of trial
                            between the applicant and the Crown. If the applicant establish to the
                            satisfaction of the court that the ship was not and is not being built,
                            commissioned or equipped, or intended to be dispatched contrary to this
                            act, the ship shall be released and restored. If the applicant fail to
                            establish to the satisfaction of the court that the ship was not and is
                            not being built, commissioned, or equipped, or intended to be dispatched
                            contrary to this act, then the ship shall be detained till released by
                            order of the secretary of state or chief executive authority. The court
                            may, in cases where no proceedings are pending for its condemnation,
                            release any ship detained under this section on the owner giving
                            security to the satisfaction of the court that the ship shall not be
                            employed contrary to this act, notwithstanding that the applicant may
                            have failed to establish to the satisfaction of the court that the ship
                            was not and is not being built, commissioned, or intended to be
                            dispatched contrary to this act. The secretary of state or the chief
                            executive authority may likewise release any ship detained under this
                            section on the owner giving security to the satisfaction of such
                            secretary of state or chief executive authority that the ship shall not
                            be employed contrary to this act, or may release the ship without such
                            security, if the secretary of state or chief executive authority think
                            fit so to release the same. If the <pb n="162" xml:id="pg_162"
                                facs="0196"/>court be of opinion that there was not reasonable and
                            probable cause for the detention, and if no such cause appear in the
                            course of the proceedings, the court shall have power to declare that
                            the owner is to be indemnified by the payment of costs and damages in
                            respect of the detention, the amount thereof to be assessed by the
                            court, and any amount so assessed shall be payable by the commissioners
                            of the treasury out of any moneys legally applicable for that purpose.
                            The court of admiralty shall also have power to make a like order for
                            the indemnity of the owner, on the application of such owner to the
                            court, in a summary, way, in cases where the ship is released by the
                            order of the secretary of state or the chief executive authority, before
                            any application is made by the owner or his agent to the court for such
                            release.</p>
                        <p>Nothing in this section contained shall affect any proceedings instituted
                            or to be instituted for the condemnation of any ship detained under this
                            section where such ship is liable to forfeiture, subject to this
                            provision, that if such ship is restored in pursuance of this section,
                            all proceedings for such condemnation shall be stayed; and where the
                            court declares that the owner is to be indemnified by the payment of
                            costs and damages for the detainer, all costs, charges, and expenses
                            incurred by such owner in or about any proceedings for the condemnation
                            of such ship shall be added to the costs and damages payable to him in
                            respect of the detention of the ship. Nothing in this section contained
                            shall apply to any foreign non-commissioned ship dispatched from any
                            part of her Majesty’s dominions after having come within them under
                            stress of weather, or in the course of a peaceful voyage, and upon which
                            ship no fitting out or equipping of a warlike character has taken place
                            in this country.</p>
                        <p>Twenty-fourth. Where it is represented to any local authority, as defined
                            by this act, and such local authority believes the representation, that
                            there is a reasonable and probable cause for believing that a ship
                            within her Majesty’s dominions has been or is being built, commissioned,
                            or equipped contrary to this act, and is about to be taken beyond the
                            limits of such dominions, or that a ship is about to be dispatched
                            contrary to this act, it shall be the duty of such local authority to
                            detain such ship, and forthwith to communicate the fact of such
                            detention to the secretary of state or chief executive authority. Upon
                            the receipt of such communication the secretary of state or chief
                            executive authority may order the ship to be released if he thinks there
                            is no cause for detaining her, but if satisfied that there is reasonable
                            and probable cause for believing that such ship was built, commissioned,
                            or equipped, or intended to be dispatched in contravention of this act,
                            he shall issue his warrant stating that there is reasonable and probable
                            cause for believing as aforesaid, and upon such warrant being issued,
                            further proceedings shall be had as in cases where the seizure or
                            detention has taken place on a warrant issued by the secretary of state
                            without any communication from the local authority. Where the secretary
                            of state or chief executive authority orders the ship to be released, on
                            the receipt of a communication from the local authority, without issuing
                            his warrant, the owner of the ship shall be indemnified by the payment
                            of costs and damages in respect of the detention, upon application to
                            the court of admiralty in a summary way in like manner as he is entitled
                            to be indemnified where the secretary of state having issued his warrant
                            under this act releases the ship before any application is made by the
                            owner or his agent to the court for such release.</p>
                        <p>Twenty-fifth. The secretary of state or the chief executive authority
                            may, by warrant, empower any person to enter any dock-yard or other
                            place within her Majesty’s dominions and inquire as to the destination
                            of any ship which may appear to him to be intended to be employed in the
                            naval or military service of any foreign state at war with a friendly
                            state, and to search such ship.</p>
                        <p>Twenty-sixth. Any powers or jurisdiction by this act given to the
                            secretary of state may be exercised by him throughout the dominions of

                        <p>Thirty-first. From and after the commencement of this act, an act passed
                            in the fifty-ninth year of the reign of his late Majesty King George the
                            Third, chapter sixty-nine, intituled “An act to prevent the enlisting or
                            engagement of his Majesty’s subjects to serve in foreign service, and
                            the fitting out or equipping, in his Majesty’s dominions, vessels for

                            Provided that such repeal shall not affect any penalty, forfeiture, or

                            committed before this act comes into operation, nor the institution of
                            any investigation or legal proceeding, or any other remedy for enforcing
                            any such penalty, forfeiture, or punishment as aforesaid.</p>
                        <p>Thirty-second. Nothing in this act contained shall subject to forfeiture
                            any commissioned ship of any foreign state, or give to any British court
                            over or in respect of any ship entitled to recognition as a commissioned

                            if this act had not passed.</p>
                        <p>Thirty-third. Nothing in this act contained shall extend or be construed

                            states, or potentates in Asia.</p>

                            in these words:</p>
                        <p>“It is an authentic fact that the French government telegraphed to London
                            yesterday to know if General Lee is here or whether he is expected. The
                            supposition is that a military command is to be offered him.</p>
                        <p>“No news here from Prussian headquarters since Sunday evening.”</p>
                        <p>I am not aware that General Lee is in London or that he is expected here.
                            The fact, however, that the French government should show such anxiety
                            to obtain the assistance of military talent from so distant a quarter
                            would seem to argue some want of confidence in the government of their

                            Germany, which has just been made public, defining the views of the

                            or <hi rend="italic">ancipitis usus,</hi> and replying to certain
                            complaints which have been made in Germany that Great Britain had

                            <p>The following is a copy of a circular which has been addressed to her
                                Majesty’s diplomatic and consular representatives in Germany:</p>

                                <hi rend="italic">August</hi> 11, 1870.</p>
                            <p>Her Majesty’s government have learnt with much regret that an
                                impression exists in Germany that Great Britain is deviating from
                                the attitude of neutrality which she has announced her resolution to
                                observe, by giving France facilities for obtaining certain articles
                                useful to her for war purposes, such as munitions of war, horses and
                                coal, while such facilities are not accorded in an equal degree to
                                the allied German States.</p>
                            <p>It is not unnatural that, in a moment of excitement like the present,
                                the German people should be more than ordinarily sensitive in
                                watching the attitude of nations which are taking no part in the
                                struggle, and it cannot be wondered at that they should for a time
                                accept as facts unfounded rumors, and that they should somewhat
                                hastily condemn, as breaches of neutrality, proceedings which, at a
                                calmer season, they would not hesitate to pronounce, with that
                                impartiality of judgment for which they are distinguished, to be
                                strictly in accordance with the usages of international law and
                                comity.</p>
                            <p>Her Majesty’s government lost no time, after the declarations of war
                                had been exchanged, in announcing the determination of Great Britain
                                to maintain a position of neutrality between the contending parties,
                                and this position has been hitherto faithfully <pb n="165"
                                    xml:id="pg_165" facs="0199"/>observed. It is not true that any
                                facilities have been given, or any restrictions imposed, which are
                                not equally applicable to both belligerents.</p>
                            <p>The steps taken by her Majesty’s government have been strictly in
                                accordance with precedent and with the principles by which neutral
                                nations, including Prussia herself, have been guided in recent wars.
                                But it now appears to be wished that Great Britain should go
                                further, and that she should not only enjoin upon British subjects
                                the obligations of neutrality, but that she should take it upon
                                herself to enforce those obligations in a manner and to an extent
                                wholly unusual. It is demanded that she should not only forbid, but
                                absolutely prevent, the exportation of articles contraband of war,
                                that is to say, that she should decide herself what articles are to
                                be considered as contraband of war, and that she should keep such a
                                watch upon her ports as to make it impossible for such articles to
                                be exported from them.</p>
                            <p>It requires but little consideration to be convinced that this is a
                                task which a neutral power can hardly be called upon to perform.
                                Different nations take different views at different times as to what
                                articles are to be ranked as contraband of war, and no general
                                decision has been come to on the subject. Strong remonstrances, for
                                instance, are made against the export of coal to France; but it has
                                been held by Prussian authors of high reputation that coal is not
                                contraband, and that no one power, either neutral or belligerent,
                                can pronounce it to be so. But. even if this point were clearly
                                defined, it is beyond dispute that the contraband character would
                                depend upon the destination. The neutral power could hardly be
                                called upon to prevent the exportation of such cargoes to a neutral
                                port; and if this be the case, how could it be decided, at the time
                                of departure of a vessel, whether the alleged neutral destination
                                were real or colorable? The question of the destination of the cargo
                                must be decided in the prize court of a belligerent, and Prussia
                                could hardly seriously propose to hold the British government
                                responsible whenever a British ship carrying a contraband cargo
                                should be captured while attempting to enter a French port.</p>
                            <p>Her Majesty’s government do not doubt that, when the present
                                excitement has subsided, the German nation will give them credit for
                                having honestly acted up to the duties of neutrality to the best of
                                their power, and they are confirmed in this conviction by the
                                recollection that, when Prussia was in the same position as that in
                                which Great Britain now finds herself, her line of conduct was
                                similar, and she found herself equally unable to enforce upon her
                                subjects stringent obligations against the exportation even of
                                unquestionable munitions of war.</p>
                            <p>During the Crimean war arms and munitions were freely exported from
                                Prussia to Russia, and arms of Belgian manufacture found their way
                                to the same quarter through. Prussian territory, in spite of a
                                decree issued by the Prussian government prohibiting the transport
                                of arms coming from foreign states.</p>
                            <p>Reflection upon these points may make the German nation inclined to
                                take a juster view of the position now occupied by her Majesty’s
                                government.</p>
                            <p>As regards the export from this country of horses and ammunition, it
                                appears from the latest tables which have been obtained from the
                                British customs that the number of horses exported during the months
                                of July and August to Germany and Belgium is approximately 413, and
                                to France 583. As regards the amount of munitions of war exported
                                during the same period, it appears from the official reports that
                                none at all have been exported to France; and only the following
                                exports have been made to German, Belgian, and Dutch ports: To
                                Belgium, ordnance stores, &amp;c., to the value of 369<hi
                                    rend="italic">l.</hi>; shot-lead, or iron, 1 cwt.; to Hamburg,
                                shot-lead, or iron, 5 cwt.; to Holland, shot-lead, or iron, 32
                                cwt.</p>
                            <p>It is not irrelevant to this matter to quote the views recently
                                expressed to a foreign minister at Washington by the Secretary of
                                State of the United States respecting the duties of neutrals in
                                regard to trade in articles contraband of war. He is reported to
                                have said that arms and ammunition had always been considered to be
                                articles of legitimate commerce by neutrals during war, and that the
                                United States claimed the right to supply them to all belligerents
                                without distinction, adding that during the civil war in America
                                quantities of these articles had been bought from England, France,
                                and Belgium.</p>
                            <p>It may be well also to observe that the Belgian government, though by
                                a recent decree it has provisionally prohibited the transit and
                                exportation of arms and munitions of war, excepts from this
                                prohibition articles which can be clearly shown to be destined for a
                                neutral government, and reserves formally the right of free
                                exportation for the future.</p>
                            <p>I am, with great truth, your most obedient, humble servant,</p>

                            <p>“M. Lutz, of the Rhône, who left Paris on Sunday in a balloon, brings
                                us this morning the report of M. Jules Favre, Minister for foreign
                                affairs, upon his interview with Count Bismarck. The report of M.
                                Jules Favre has appeared in the Journal Officiel of the 23d
                                September, in Paris. It will be seen from this report with what sort
                                of enemy we have to do, and that France can reckon only on herself.
                                The following is the report:</p>
                            <p>“‘<hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Colleagues:</hi> The close union of
                                all citizens, and particularly of the members of the government, is
                                more than ever a necessity of public safety. Every one of our acts
                                ought to cement it. That which I have just performed on my own
                                authority has inspired me with this sentiment; it will have this
                                result. I have had the honor to explain it to you in detail. That is
                                not enough. We are a government of publicity. If, in the hour of
                                execution, secrecy is indispensable, the act once completed, should
                                be surrounded by the greatest amount of light. We are nobodies save
                                for the opinion of our fellow-citizens, and they must judge us
                                hourly, and in order to form a judgment upon us, they have the right
                                to know everything. I considered it my duty to go to the
                                headquarters of the hostile armies, and I went. I have given you an
                                account of the mission which I had imposed upon myself; I am about
                                to tell my country the reasons which determined my action, the
                                object which I had placed before me, and that which I believe I have
                                attained. I need not recapitulate the policy which we inaugurated,
                                and which the minister of foreign affairs was particularly charged
                                to announce. We are, above all, men of peace and liberty. Up to the
                                last moment we opposed the war which the imperial government
                                undertook in a spirit exclusively dynastic; and when this government
                                tell, we declared that we would persevere more energetically than
                                ever in the policy of peace. We made this declaration, when, through
                                the criminal madness of one man and of his counsellors, our armies
                                were destroyed; our glorious Bazaine and his valiant soldiers
                                blocked up before Metz; Strasburg, Toul, Phalsburg, shattered by
                                bombs; and the victorious enemy marching upon our capital. Never was
                                situation more cruel; yet it did not occasion in the country any
                                thought of weakness, and we believed ourselves its faithful
                                interpreters in laying down clearly the conditions<hi rend="italic"
                                    >—</hi>“Not an inch of our territory, nor a stone of our
                                fortresses.” If, then, at this instant, when an event was
                                accomplished so important as the overthrow of the promoter of the
                                war, Prussia had desired to treat upon the basis of an indemnity to
                                be determined, peace was made, it would have been greeted as an
                                incalculable blessing; it would have received a certain pledge of
                                reconciliation between two nations which have been fatally divided
                                solely by an odious policy. We hope that humanity and interest,
                                properly understood, may gain this victory, most important of all;
                                for it would have inaugurated a new era, and the statesmen who
                                should have identified their names with it would have had as guides
                                philosophy, reason, and justice, and as rewards, the blessings and
                                the prosperity of the people. It was with these ideas that I
                                undertook the perilous task with which you intrusted me. I had at
                                once to ascertain the feelings of the European cabinets, and to seek
                                to obtain their support. The imperial government had either
                                completely neglected to do this or it failed in the attempt. It
                                engaged in the war without one alliance, without one serious
                                negotiation; all around it was hostility or indifference. It thus
                                reaped the bitter harvest of a policy noxious to each neighboring
                                state on account of its menaces or its pretensions. Scarcely were we
                                at the Hotel de Ville, when a diplomat, whose name it is not fitting
                                to reveal, asked to enter into relations with us. From the next day
                                your minister received the representatives of all the powers. The
                                Republic of the United States, the Helvetian Republic, Italy, Spain,
                                and Portugal officially recognized the French Republic. The <pb
                                    n="167" xml:id="pg_167" facs="0201"/>other governments
                                authorized their agents to maintain with us official relations which
                                permitted us to enter at once into useful negotiations. I would give
                                to this explanation, which is already too diffuse, a fullness which
                                it does not merit, if I were to relate in detail the short but
                                instructive history of the negotiations which followed. I believe I
                                am right in asserting that it will not be altogether valueless as
                                relates to our moral position. I shall only say that everywhere we
                                found honorable sympathy. My object was to collect them, and to
                                induce the powers who had signed the league of neutrality to
                                intervene directly with Prussia on the basis of the conditions which
                                I had laid down. Four of these powers offered to do so. I testified
                                to them my gratitude in the name of my country, but I wished to have
                                the coöperation of the two others. One of them promised me an
                                independent action, reserving its liberty respecting it; the other
                                proposed to be my intermediary with Prussia. It even went a step
                                further. Upon the request of the envoy extraordinary of France, it
                                was willing to give direct countenance to my proceedings. I asked
                                for much more, but I have refused no cooperation, esteeming that the
                                interest which was evinced for us was a power not to be neglected.
                                However, time was passing. Each hour brought the enemy nearer. Under
                                the most poignant feelings, I had promised myself not to permit the
                                siege of Paris to begin without making a supreme effort, were I left
                                alone to make it. It is unnecessary to enlarge upon its importance.
                                Prussia maintained silence, and no one consented to question her.
                                This state of things could not continue; it allowed our enemy to lay
                                upon us the responsibility of the continuation of the straggle; it
                                compelled us to hear it, as he intended; it must be got out of.
                                Despite my repugnance, I determined to make use of the good offices
                                which had been offered me, and on September 10 a telegram reached M.
                                de Bismarck, asking him if he would enter into a conversation with
                                me upon the conditions of a treaty. A first reply was an excuse for
                                not receiving me, deduced from the irregularity of our government.
                                However, the chancellor of the Confederation of the North did not
                                stand upon that, and asked what guarantees we could offer for the
                                execution of a treaty. This second difficulty having been removed by
                                me, it was necessary to go further. It was proposed that I should
                                send a messenger, to which I agreed. In the mean time M. de Bismarck
                                was telegraphed to directly, and the prime minister of the power
                                which acted as our intermediary said to our envoy extraordinary that
                                France alone could act; he added that it was to be desired that I
                                should not shrink from taking steps at headquarters. Our envoy, who
                                was acquainted with my inmost feelings, replied that I was ready at
                                all sacrifices to do my duty, and that there were few things so
                                painful to do as that of going through the enemy’s lines to seek our
                                conqueror, but that he supposed I would resign myself to it. Two
                                days later the courier returned. After a thousand obstacles he had
                                seen the chancellor, who had told him he was willing to converse
                                with me. I should have wished for a direct reply to the telegram of
                                our intermediary; we had to wait for it. The investment of Paris was
                                accomplished. No further hesitation was possible. I resolved to set
                                out. However, it was important to me that while it was in progress,
                                this proceeding should be secret. I advised secrecy, and was deeply
                                surprised, on returning last evening, to learn that it had not been
                                maintained. A culpable indiscretion had been committed. A journal,
                                L’Electeur Libre, already disavowed by the government, had made use
                                of it. An inquiry has been commenced, and I hope to repress this
                                double abuse. I had carried discretion so far that I observed it
                                even before you, my dear colleagues. I had not come to this
                                resolution without great repugnance; but I knew your patriotism and
                                your affection—I was certain of your forgiveness. I believed I was
                                acting in obedience to an imperious necessity. On the first occasion
                                I spoke with you of the troubles of my mind, and told you it would
                                not be at rest until I had done everything that was humanly possible
                                with honor to arrest this abominable war. Recollecting the
                                conversation which followed from this commencement, I feared
                                objections, and I was decided. Further, I wished, in meeting M. de
                                Bismarck, to be free from any engagement, in order to have the right
                                not to accept any. I make to you these sincere avowals; I make them
                                to the country to remove from you a responsibility which I take upon
                                myself alone. If my proceeding has been an error, I alone should
                                bear the blame. I bad, nevertheless, informed the minister of war,
                                who was kind enough to give me an officer to conduct me to the
                                outposts. We did not know where headquarters were situated. We
                                imagined them to be at Grosbois. We started on our way toward the
                                enemy by the gate of Charenton. I suppress all the details of this
                                sorrowful journey, full of interest nevertheless, but which would
                                not be in place here. Conducted to Villeneuve St. Georges, where I
                                found the general-in-chief commanding the sixth corps, I learnt full
                                late in the aftern on that headquarters were at Meaux. The general,
                                whose treatment of me was all that could be desired, proposed to
                                send an officer to carry the following letter which I had written
                                for M. de Bismarck:</p>
                            <p>“‘M. le <hi rend="smallcaps">Compte:</hi> I have always believed that
                                before seriously commencing hostilities under the walls of Paris, it
                                would be possible for some honorable negotiation to be attempted.
                                The person who had the honor of seeing your excellency two days ago
                                informed me that you yourself had expressed such a desire. I have
                                come to the outposts <pb n="168" xml:id="pg_168" facs="0202"/>to
                                place myself at the disposal of your excellency. I trust that you
                                will deign to inform me how and where I can have the honor of
                                conferring for some minutes with you.</p>

                                at six o’clock I received the reply, which I transcribe:</p>
                            <p>“‘I have just received the letter that your excellency was good

                                bearer of the present, Prince Biron, will see that your excellency
                                is guided through our lines.</p>

                            <p>“‘At 9 o’clock the escort was ready, and I left with it. When I got
                                near Meaux, about 3 in afternoon, I was stopped by an aide-de-camp
                                who came to inform me that the Count had left Meaux with the King to
                                sleep at Ferrières. We had passed each other, and by retracing our
                                steps we should both of us meet. I retraced my way and halted in the
                                courtyard of a farm entirely plundered, as were nearly all the
                                houses that I passed on my way. At the end of an hour M. de Bismarck
                                joined me there. It was difficult for us to talk in such a place. A
                                house, the Château de le Haute Maison, belonging to the Count de
                                Rillac, was close to us, and we went there. The conversation took
                                place in a saloon, where in disorder lay fragments of all kinds. I
                                should like to report the whole of this conversation, such as I
                                dictated it to a secretary on the following day. Every one of its
                                details has its importance. But I can only give an analysis of the
                                same. At the commencement I stated briefly the object of proceeding.
                                Having published in my circular the intentions of the French
                                government I wished to know those of the Prussian prime minister. It
                                appeared to me inadmissible that two nations should continue without
                                preliminary and mutual explanations a terrible war, which, in spite
                                of its advantages, would inflict most serious injuries upon the
                                conqueror. Created by the power of an individual, this war had no
                                further <hi rend="italic">raison d’étre</hi>. now that France had
                                again become her own mistress. I offered to guarantee her desire for
                                peace, and at the same time her irrevocable resolve not to accept
                                any condition which would render this peace a short and threatening
                                truce. M. de Bismarck replied to me that were he convinced that such
                                a peace were possible, he would sign it directly. He acknowledged
                                that the opposition had always condemned the war. But the power
                                which this opposition represents at present is more than precarious.
                                If in a few days Paris is not taken, it will be overthrown by the
                                populace. I immediately interrupted him by saying we had no populace
                                in Paris, but a population intelligent and devoted, rally aware of
                                our intentions, and who would not become accomplices of the enemy by
                                fettering our mission of defense. With regard to our power, we were
                                ready to place it in the hands of the assembly which we had already
                                convoked. “This assembly,” replied the count, “might have designs
                                which nothing can make us foresee If it listens to the sentiments of
                                France it will desire war. You would no more forget the capitulation
                                of Sedan than that of Waterloo, or that of Sadowa, which did not
                                affect you.” Further, he maintained strongly the determination
                                clearly expressed by the French nation to attack Germany and to
                                deprive her of a portion of her territory. “From Louis XIV down to
                                Napoleon III these tendencies have not changed; and when war was
                                announced, the Corps Legislatif received the words of the minister
                                with acclamations.” I remarked to him that the majority of the Corps
                                Legislatif had, a few weeks before, received the news of peace with
                                acclamation; that this majority, chosen by the prince, unfortunately
                                thought itself obliged to confide blindly in him, but consulted
                                twice, at the elections of 1869, and at the vote of the <hi
                                    rend="italic">plébiscite</hi> the nation had energetically
                                adhered to a political course of peace and liberty. The conversation
                                was prolonged on this subject, the count maintaining his opinion and
                                I defending mine; and, as I pressed him hard as to the conditions,
                                he replied distinctly that the security of his country demanded that
                                he should retain the territory which guaranteed it. He repeated
                                several times, “Strasburg is the key of the house; I ought to have
                                it.” I requested him to be more explicit. “It is useless,” he
                                objected, “we cannot come to terms; it is a matter which must be
                                decided later.” I requested him to do so immediately; he then told
                                me that the two departments of the Bas and Haut Rhin, a part of that
                                of the Moselle, including Metz, Château Salins, and Soissons, were
                                indispensable to him, and he could not recede from these conditions.
                                I remarked to him that the consent of the people whom he thus
                                disposed of was more than doubtful; that the public rights of Europe
                                would not permit him to disregard it. “Oh, yes, indeed,” he replied
                                to me, “I am perfectly aware that they do not desire ns. We shall
                                have some hard work cut out for us by them, but we cannot do
                                otherwise than take them. l am certain that at a future time we
                                shall have a fresh war with you, and we wish to undertake it under
                                every advantage.” I expostulated, as was my duty, against similar
                                propositions. I said that it seemed to me as if two important

                                sight of in this discussion: in the first place, Europe, which might
                                find such pretensions exorbitant and offer opposition; and, again,
                                that modern rights, and the progress of all customs, were entirely
                                antipathetic to such exigencies. I added that, as far as we were
                                concerned, we could never agree to them. “We can perish as a nation,
                                but we cannot dishonor ourselves. However, the country itself was
                                alone competent to give an opinion respecting any cession of
                                territory. We have not any doubts as to its feeling, but we wish
                                first to consult it. It is before the whole nation that Prussia must
                                take up her position; and to speak plainly, it is clear that, led
                                away by the frenzy of victory, she desires the destruction of
                                France.” The count protested against this conclusion, alleging the
                                absolute necessity of a national guarantee. I continued: “If on your
                                side it is not an abuse of power, covering secret designs, let us
                                call an assembly together; we will hand it our powers, and it will
                                appoint a definite government, who will be able to appreciate your
                                conditions.” “In order to carry out this plan,” replied the count,
                                “an armistice would be required, and I will not grant one at any
                                price,” The conversation took a more and more painful turn. Night
                                came, I requested M. de Bismarck to give me a second interview at
                                Ferrières, where he was going to sleep, and we each went our way.
                                Desiring to fulfill my mission to the end, I had to raise several
                                questions that we had argued, and to conclude them. Therefore, on
                                meeting the count about half-past nine at night, I remarked to him
                                that the information which I had come to obtain from him was
                                intended to be transmitted to my government and to the public;
                                therefore I should resume in conclusion our conversation, so as only
                                to publish what had entirely been agreed upon between us. “Do not
                                take that trouble,” replied he, “you can publish it <hi
                                    rend="italic">in extenso.</hi> I do not see any reason why it
                                should not be divulged.” We then resumed our discussion, which
                                continued till midnight. I dwelt considerably upon the necessity of
                                convoking an assembly. The count appeared to allow himself to be
                                convinced by degrees, but returned to the armistice. I asked for a
                                fortnight. We discussed the conditions. He only expressed himself
                                very vaguely, and elected to consult the King. Consequently he
                                adjourned the interview to 11 o’clock on the following day. I have
                                only one more word to say, for in repeating this sad recital my mind
                                is agitated by all those emotions which have tortured it during
                                three mortal days, and I yearn to finish. I arrived at the Château
                                of Ferrières at 11 o’clock. The count was coming from the King at a
                                quarter to twelve, and I heard from him the conditions upon which an
                                armistice would be granted; they were written in the German
                                language, and a verbal communication was made to me of their
                                purport. He asked as a guarantee the occupation of Strasburg, Toul,
                                and Phalsburg; and as, in answer to a question from him, I had told
                                him on the previous day that the assembly would take place in Paris,
                                he wished in this case to have a fort dominating the city, as, for
                                instance, that of Mont Valérien. I interrupted him by remarking, “It
                                is much simpler to ask for Paris at once. How can you suppose that a
                                French assembly could deliberate under your guns? I had the honor of
                                informing you that I should faithfully communicate our interview to
                                the government, and I hardly know if I dare mention to them that you
                                have made such a proposal to me.” “Let us seek some other
                                combination,” he replied. I spoke to him of a reunion of the
                                assembly at Tours, no guarantee being given as far as Paris was
                                concerned. I suggested he should speak of this to the King, and
                                again speaking of the occupation of Strasburg, he added: “The town
                                will fall into our hands; it is now only a matter of calculation for
                                our engineers. Therefore I demand of you that the garrison shall
                                surrender themselves prisoners of war.” At these words I could not
                                suppress my feelings, and rising, I cried: “You forget you are
                                speaking to a Frenchman, M. le Comte. To thus sacrifice a heroic
                                garrison whose behaviour has been admired universally, and more
                                particularly by us, would be cowardice, and I promise not to say
                                that you have offered me such a condition.” The count replied that
                                he had had no intention of hurting my feelings; that he conformed to
                                the laws of war; and that, moreover, if the King gave his consent,
                                this article might be modified. He returned in a quarter of an hour.
                                The King accepted the proposal as to Tours, but insisted that the
                                garrison of Strasburg should constitute themselves prisoners. I was
                                perfectly exhausted, and feared for the moment that I should faint.
                                I turned away to hide the tears which suffocated me, and asking to
                                be excused for my involuntary weakness, I took leave with these few
                                words: “I made a mistake, M. le Comte, in coming here; but I do not
                                regret it, I have suffered sufficiently to excuse myself in my own
                                eyes, but in any case I only yielded to a feeling of duty. I will
                                report to my government all that you have said, and should they
                                consider it fit again to send me to you, however cruel the task for
                                me, I shall have the honor of returning. I am grateful for the
                                kindness you have shown me, but I fear that all that can be done is
                                to let events take their course. The inhabitants of Paris are
                                courageous, and resolved to make every sacrifice, and their heroism
                                may change the course of events. If you have the honor of conquering
                                them, you will never subjugate them. The whole nation is possessed
                                with the same sentiments. As long as there can be found one element
                                of resistance among us, we shall fight you. This becomes an
                                interminable struggle between two nations who should extend their
                                hands to each other. I had hoped for a different <pb n="170"
                                    xml:id="pg_170" facs="0204"/>solution. I leave, most unhappy,
                                but nevertheless full of hope.” I add nothing to this recital, too
                                eloquent in itself. It enables me to conclude, and to inform you
                                what is, in my idea, the aim of these interviews. I sought peace,
                                and found an inflexible desire for conquest and war. I demanded an
                                opportunity of interrogating France, represented by an assembly
                                freely elected, and I was replied to by being shown the Caudine
                                Forks under which France must first pass. I do not recriminate. I
                                content myself by relating facts, and publishing them to my country
                                and to Europe. I ardently desired peace. I do not disguise the fact,
                                and witnessing during three days the misery existing in our
                                unfortunate country, I felt this desire increase within me to such
                                an extent that I was forced to summon all my courage to my aid, so
                                as not to fail in my task. I wished for an armistice almost as
                                eagerly. I again confess it. I wished it so that the nation might be
                                consulted respecting the redoubtable question that fatality had
                                placed before us. You are now acquainted with the preliminary
                                conditions which they desire to impose upon us. Equally with myself,
                                and without discussion, you have been unanimously of opinion that
                                such humiliation should be rejected. I possess the profound
                                conviction that in spite of the sufferings she is now enduring, and
                                which she sees before her, France, indignant, shares our
                                determination, and inspired by these feelings I addressed to M. de
                                Bismarck the following dispatch, which closes our negotiations:</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">“‘M. Le Comte:</hi> I have faithfully reported
                                to my colleagues of the government for the national defense the
                                declaration that your excellency deigned to make to me. I regret to
                                inform your excellency that the government could not entertain your
                                propositions. They would accept an armistice in order to proceed to
                                the election and meeting of a National Assembly, but they cannot
                                subscribe to the conditions your excellency imposes. For my own
                                part, I have the satisfaction of having done everything to stay the
                                shedding of blood and to obtain the restoration of peace to the two
                                nations, to whom it would prove the greatest blessing. I am only
                                arrested by an imperious obligation which commands me not to
                                sacrifice the honor of my country, which is determined upon an
                                energetic resistance. I unite without reserve in this feeling, as do
                                my colleagues. God, who judges us, will decide our destinies. I have
                                faith in His justice. I have, &amp;c.</p>

                                you will think, as I do, that even if I have failed, my mission has
                                not been totally useless. It has proved that we have not deviated.
                                As during the first days we cursed a war which was condemned by us
                                beforehand, so also during the first days we rather accept it than
                                dishonor. We have done more; we have abolished the equivocal
                                position in which Prussia enclosed itself, and which Europe did not
                                aid us to dissipate. On entering into our territory she gave the
                                world her word that she attacked Napoleon and his soldiers, but she
                                would respect the nation. We know to-day what to think of such
                                statements. Prussia exacts three of our departments, two fortified
                                towns, one containing 100,000 and the other 75,000 inhabitants, and
                                eight or ten other places equally fortified. She is aware that the
                                populations she wishes to tear from us will resist her, but she
                                seizes them nevertheless; opposing the edge of her sword to the
                                protestations of civic liberty and moral dignity. To a nation
                                requesting the faculty of consulting itself, it proposes a guarantee
                                of its batteries of howitzers planted on Mont Valérien to protect
                                the place of our deliberations where our deputies will vote. This is
                                what we know and what I am authorized to inform you. Let the whole
                                nation hear us and rise up, either to repudiate us when we advise it
                                to resist <hi rend="italic">à outrance,</hi> or to support with us
                                this last and decisive trial. Paris is resolved upon it. The
                                departments are organizing themselves and will come to our
                                assistance. The last word has not been pronounced in this struggle,
                                where might is combating against right. It depends upon our
                                constancy whether it be spoken for justice and liberty.</p>

                            <p>The following correspondence has passed between the ambassador of the
                                North German Confederation and the secretary for foreign

                            <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">“memorandum communicated by count
                                    bernstorff to earl granville, september 1, 1870.</hi></p>
                            <p>“It would be waste of time at the present crisis to enter upon an
                                exhaustive juridical examination of the existing neutrality laws and
                                their ultimate bearing and scope. It is not too late, however, to
                                glance in a practical manner at a question which every hour may
                                cause fresh and momentous complications, especially as affecting
                                national susceptibilities.</p>
                            <p>“In the first instance there is no question that France has wantonly
                                made war on Germany. The verdict of the world, and especially the
                                verdict of the statesmen as well, as of the public of England, has
                                unanimously pronounced the Emperor of the French guilty of a most
                                flagitious breach of the peace. Germany, on the other hand, entered
                                into the contest with the consciousness of a good cause. She was,
                                therefore, led to expect that the neutrality of Great Britain, her
                                former ally against Napoleonic aggression, however strict in form
                                would at least be benevolent in spirit to Germany, for it is
                                impossible for the human mind not to side with one or the other
                                party in a conflict like the present one. What is the use of being
                                right or wrong in the eyes of the world if the public remains
                                insensible to the merits of a cause? Those who deny the necessity of
                                such a distinction forego the appeal to public opinion, which we are
                                daily taught to consider as the foremost of the great powers.</p>
                            <p>“In examining from this point of view whether the neutrality of Great
                                Britain has been practically benevolent as regards Germany, it’ is
                                best to reverse the question and to put it in this shape: If Germany
                                had been the aggressor, and, consequently, condemned by public
                                opinion, in what way could the government and the people of the
                                United Kingdom have been able to avoid taking an active part in the
                                struggle, and, at the same time, to prove to France their benevolent
                                intentions? Being short of coal, the French would have been allowed
                                to find here all they needed for their naval expeditions. Their
                                preparations for war not being so far advanced and not so complete
                                as they first thought, the French would have found the manufacturers
                                of arms and ammunitions in this country ready to supply them with,
                                and the British government willing not to prevent their obtaining
                                here, all the material they wanted. This, we think, would have been
                                the utmost aid which Great Britain could have granted to France,
                                without transgressing the letter of the existing neutrality laws,
                                had the parts of aggressor and attacked, of right and wrong, been
                                the reverse of the present condition.</p>
                            <p>“In the face of the continuous export of arms, ammunition, coal, and
                                other war material from this country to France; in the face of facts
                                openly made a boast of by the French minister of war, and not denied
                                by the British government, it is not necessary to prove that the
                                neutrality of Great Britain, far from being impartial toward that
                                party which has been pronounced to be in the right, is, on the
                                contrary, such as it might possibly have been if that party had been
                                wrong in the eyes of the British people and government. When
                                defending the new foreign enlistment act in Parliament the
                                representatives of the government declared that the law empowered
                                the executive to prevent the export of contraband of war, but that
                                in order to make it effectual toward the belligerents it ought to be
                                generally enforced, and would thus even affect the commerce of this
                                country with other neutrals. This statement, however, cannot be
                                admitted, for there is no necessity to hamper the trade with neutral
                                countries by preventing the exportation of contraband of war to the
                                belligerents. Had the government declared such exportation to the
                                belligerents to be illegal, it would have remained an exception,
                                subject to penalty, if detected. The <hi rend="italic">bona
                                    fide</hi> trade with neutrals would not <pb n="172"
                                    xml:id="pg_172" facs="0206"/>in the least have been affected
                                thereby. But the government, far from doing this refused even to
                                accept such propositions as might have prevented direct or
                                clandestine exportation of contraband of war to France; besides, it
                                cannot be admitted that such prohibitive measures could in reality
                                damage the regular and lawful trade of the English people at large.
                                They would merely prevent some rapacious individuals from
                                disregarding the verdict of the nation, and realizing enormous
                                profits which never would have legitimately been made under ordinary
                                circumstances. The rapid increase of the private fortunes of a few
                                tradesmen by such ventures could not appreciably add to the national
                                wealth of the country. But, on the other hand, the nation will be
                                held morally responsible for the blood which is being shed through
                                the agency of those individuals. It will be said that the war would
                                have ended sooner, and that less German soldiers would have been
                                killed and wounded, had not the people and government of England
                                permitted such abuses.</p>
                            <p>“It hardly could be seriously meant to say that the Germans are at
                                liberty to bring each case before their prize courts, for it would
                                be out of place thus to taunt Germany with not being mistress of the
                                seas. The question is whether England may escape the just reproach
                                on the part of Germany of having greatly increased the advantage
                                France already possesses at sea, by fitting out her navy with the
                                requisite material to attack the seaboards of Germany and annihilate
                                its commerce, as well as of arming the French Garde Mobile with
                                English breech-loaders, to be used against the German soldiers in
                                the field.</p>
                            <p>“England will thus be accused of feeding a war which would have ended
                                sooner had France been left dependent on her own resources. Hence
                                the policy of the British government, notwithstanding the verdict of
                                public opinion in this country in favor of the German cause, is, if
                                not intentionally, at least practically, benevolent to France,
                                without there being any real foundation for the excuse that the
                                commercial interests of this country would be seriously affected by
                                a different course.</p>
                            <p>“There is still another reason put forward by the British government
                                in reference to their line of action. It is the allusion to Prussian
                                neutrality during the Crimean war. Germany is told to consider that,
                                at that time, ‘arms and ammunition were freely exported from Prussia
                                to Russia; and arms of Belgian manufacture found their way to the
                                same quarter through Prussian territory in spite of a decree issued
                                by the Prussian government prohibiting the transport of arms coming
                                from foreign states.’</p>
                            <p>“Lord Granville says, in his circular of the 11th instant, ‘that
                                reflection upon these points may make the German nation inclined to
                                take a juster view of the position now occupied by her Majesty’s
                                government.’</p>
                            <p>“All who recollect the political aspect of that time will admit that
                                there is no real analogy between the two cases. At the period
                                alluded to public opinion, in Germany was very doubtful as to the
                                wisdom of helping a Napoleon to become once more the arbiter of
                                Europe. Besides, it was not a struggle for life and death between
                                two nations equally matched, but it was a war waged in remote
                                regions for remote interests by four powers against one, without the
                                national existence of England being the least endangered.</p>
                            <p>“Had England alone been the enemy of Russia, the comparison of the
                                two cases would be less wanting in point.</p>
                            <p>“However, it will be remembered how strongly Great Britain
                                remonstrated at the time against the alleged wrong of Prussia. There
                                is but one possible alternative. Either the complaints of the
                                British government were founded, or they were not. If they really
                                were, how can it be maintained at present that the complaints of
                                Germany are unfounded, should even the great difference of the two
                                cases be entirely disregarded? By declaring the present grievances
                                of Germany devoid of foundation the British government disavow
                                implicitly the bitter charges they preferred at the time, and
                                condemn the ill-feeling created by them, and partly entertained ever
                                since in this country against Prussia.</p>
                            <p>“It is absolutely impossible to conciliate, with any show of reason
                                and logic, defending the justice of those charges on one side and
                                refusing on the other to acknowledge the present grievances of
                                Germany to be well founded.</p>
                            <p>“This being true, there is but one motive which might be alleged as
                                an excuse for the present policy of the British government toward
                                Germany. That is to apply the principle of retaliation for an
                                alleged wrong done a long time ago under circumstances completely
                                different from the present situation in every possible respect.</p>
                            <p>“To establish in our times such a principle as a rule for the policy
                                of a great nation would be too inconsistent with the general feeling
                                and moral disposition of this country to admit of its being the
                                intention of the British government.</p>
                            <p>“Should the position now occupied by the British government in regard
                                to Germany, notwithstanding the admitted justice of her cause,
                                continue to be maintained, it would be difficult even for the
                                stanchest advocate of friendship between England and Germany to
                                persuade the German nation that they have been fairly dealt by.</p>

                            <p>“M. l’A<hi rend="smallcaps">mbassador:</hi> I have the honor to
                                assure your excellency that her Majesty’s government have not failed
                                to consider most carefully the arguments contained in the memorandum
                                which you did me the honor to place in my hands on the 1st instant,
                                and have studied them the more attentively as they contain matter
                                which has not hitherto been imported into discussions upon the
                                duties of neutrals.</p>
                            <p>“The two principal positions assumed by your excellency are, first,
                                that the attitude of Great Britain toward Prussia in the present war
                                should be that of a ‘benevolent neutrality;’ and, secondly, that
                                there is no analogy between the course adopted by Prussia when Great
                                Britain was at war with Russia and that adopted by Great Britain now
                                that Prussia is at war with France.</p>
                            <p>“In examining these propositions her Majesty’s government are
                                relieved from the necessity of entering at present into the question
                                whether Great Britain is honestly fulfilling her duties as a
                                neutral. The point raised by you goes far beyond this. It amounts to
                                a demand that her neutrality should be, both in spirit and practice,
                                benevolent toward Prussia, and, consequently, as it would seem,
                                unfavorable toward France.</p>
                            <p>“Upon the declaration of hostilities, her Majesty’s government
                                publicly declared that they were desirous of maintaining their good
                                relations with, and tendering their good offices to, both the
                                belligerents, as far as was consistent with perfect neutrality. But
                                the idea of a ‘benevolent neutrality,’ as explained by your
                                excellency, is new, and it consequently becomes necessary to
                                consider what is its meaning, and what would be its practical
                                effect.</p>
                            <p>“It is obvious that your excellency cannot intend to lay down a
                                principle applicable only to the present war; rules of international
                                law cannot be confined to individual or exceptional cases; and this
                                principle, if accepted, can only be so as a principle of
                                international law, and, as such, susceptible of general application.
                                This applied, then, its effect would be as follows: That, on the
                                outbreak of a war between two nations, it would be the duty of each
                                neutral to ascertain which belligerent was favored by the public
                                opinion of its subjects, and to assume an attitude of neutrality
                                benevolent toward that belligerent. But such neutrality should not,
                                as I gather from your excellency’s memorandum, be confined to
                                sympathy, but should be exhibited in practice—that is to say, the
                                measures adopted by each neutral should be favorable to one
                                belligerent and proportionately unfavorable to the other. It seems
                                hardly possible to push the examination further without finding
                                ourselves met by insuperable difficulties. Where could the line be
                                drawn between a departure from the usual practice, in order to
                                confer material advantages on one belligerent state, to the
                                exclusion of the other, and a participation in hostilities? The
                                sympathies of nations, as of individuals, are hot invariably
                                influenced by abstract considerations of right or wrong, but are
                                swayed by material interests and other causes. Neutrals would
                                probably, therefore, be found ranged on different sides. What would
                                be the material relations of such neutrals? What their relations
                                with the belligerent to whom they were opposed? It seems hardly to
                                admit of doubt that neutrality, when it once departs from strict
                                impartiality, runs the risk of altering its essence, and that the
                                moment a neutral allows his proceedings to be biased by predilection
                                for one of two belligerents he ceases to be a neutral. The idea,
                                therefore, of benevolent neutrality can mean little less than the
                                extinction of neutrality.</p>
                            <p>“Passing to the second proposition laid down by your excellency, that
                                there is no real analogy between the conduct of Prussia in the
                                Crimean war and that of Great Britain in the present war, I find
                                that this proposition is mainly rested on the ground that Great
                                Britain, in the former war, was not fighting single-handed, and that
                                public opinion in Germany was not enlisted in favor of the cause for
                                which she was contending. These two reasons may be brought under the
                                same head, as both can only be adduced with any weight in
                                justification of a position of benevolent neutrality; but, as this
                                justification was not preferred at the time by Prussian statesmen in
                                discussing this question, it will be useful to consider what was the
                                attitude of Prussia during the war waged by Great Britain and her
                                allies against Russia, and what were the motives alleged at the time
                                for her assuming that attitude.</p>
                            <p>“During the whole of the war arms and other contraband of war were
                                copiously supplied to Russia by the states of the Zollverein;
                                regular agents for traffic were established at Berlin, Magdeburg,
                                Thorn, Königsberg, Posen, Bromberg, and other places, and no
                                restraint was put upon their operations. But, besides this, although
                                a decree was published in March 1854, prohibiting the transit of
                                arms from other countries, and a further decree in March 1855,
                                prohibiting also the transit of other contraband of war, the transit
                                trade from Belgium continued in full activity throughout the war.
                                The Prussian government, when this state of things was brought to
                                its notice, affirmed, not that it was justified in permitting these
                                exports on the principle of ‘benevolent neutrality,’ but that it
                                could not interfere with the course of trade; an answer which would
                                seem to have been based rather on the principle that the first duty
                                of Prussia, as <pb n="174" xml:id="pg_174" facs="0208"/>a neutral,
                                was to consider the interests of her own subjects, not those of the
                                subjects of a country which had engaged itself in a war with which
                                Prussia had no concern.</p>
                            <p>“Such was the attitude of Prussia at that time, and such her
                                justification of that attitude. In what point does the analogy fail?
                                Prussia was neutral then as Great Britain is now. Your excellency
                                alludes to the magnitude of the respective wars. A war in which the
                                energies of five European powers were taxed to the utmost can,
                                perhaps, hardly be justly described as a war waged in remote regions
                                for remote interests; but this point seems scarcely worthy of
                                contention. Your excellency can hardly mean to say that principles
                                of this importance are to be decided on questions of degree. If no
                                weightier objection than, this can be adduced, the analogy would
                                appear to be complete.</p>
                            <p>“I now come to the dilemma in which your excellency would place her
                                Majesty’s government. You observe that Great Britain remonstrated
                                strongly against the state of things above described, and you add
                                that either those remonstrances were founded, or they were not. If
                                founded, how, you ask, can the present complaints of Germany be held
                                to be unfounded?</p>
                            <p>“Her Majesty’s government do not complain of the Prussian government
                                making an effort to alter a state of things which they conceive to
                                be at this moment disadvantageous to them; but her Majesty’s
                                government are of opinion that the answers which the Prussian
                                government made during the Crimean war more than justify the reply
                                which, to my great regret, I hade been obliged on several occasions
                                to make, and now again to repeat, to your excellency. The nature of
                                those answers will be seen on referring to the correspondence which
                                passed at the time between the two governments, which shows also the
                                nature of the remonstrances addressed to Prussia by Great Britain.
                                On ascertaining that the Prussian government did not mean to
                                restrict the export of arms or contraband of war of native origin,
                                but intended to prohibit the transit of such articles, her Majesty’s
                                government consulted the legal advisers of the Crown as to the
                                extent to which they would be justified in making representations
                                founded on their rights as belligerents. The answer was clear—that
                                her Majesty’s government would be entitled to remonstrate only in
                                the event of violation of Prussian law; and it will be found on
                                reference to the correspondence that, though the large direct
                                exportations from the states of the Zollverein certainly formed
                                occasionally the subject of representations and discussions, the
                                strong remonstrances to which your excellency alludes were, with few
                                exceptions, made on the subject of the continuous violation of the
                                injunctions of the decrees forbidding the transit of arms, which
                                violation was so systematic that in only one case, of the stoppage
                                at Aix-la-Chapelle of some revolvers concealed in bales of cotton,
                                were the customs authorities successful in interposing a check on
                                it. It is true that remonstrances were made on the receipt of a
                                report, to which a full and complete contradiction was given, that
                                rifles belonging to the Prussian government had been sold to Russia,
                                and of a report that wagons loaded with gunpowder had been escorted
                                to the frontier by Prussian police; but the distinction is obvious
                                between these cases and cases affecting private individuals.</p>
                            <p>“I would, therefore, venture to remark that your excellency’s dilemma
                                is more apparent than real. The course of Great Britain then and now
                                is perfectly consistent. As she then remonstrated against
                                infractions of Prussian law, so she now admits the justice of
                                remonstrances against infractions of British law, such as
                                store-ships, enlistments, and others; and any cases of such
                                infraction which your excellency may bring under my notice shall
                                receive the most prompt attention.</p>
                            <p>“Your excellency now requires alterations of practice and the
                                creation or restrictions on trade in a sense favorable to Prussian
                                interests. In face of these demands I would put to your excellency
                                this question: When did Prussia renounce the principles on which she
                                acted in 1854 and 1855, to which she adhered, as far as I am aware,
                                when she again occupied the position of a neutral in the war waged
                                by Austria with France and Italy in 1859, and in the war between the
                                Northern and Southern States of America, and to which she has
                                formally given her sanction in the treaties with the United States
                                of 1799 and 1828?</p>
                            <p>“So far I have confined my reply to the examination of what may
                                appear to me to be the novel elements in your excellency’s
                                arguments; but it now beeomes my duty to address myself to the
                                consideration of the statement made that the policy of her Majesty’s
                                government has been practically benevolent to France, and that the
                                British nation, which has not prevented the export to France of
                                contraband of war and supplies useful for warlike purposes, will be
                                held morally responsible for the blood which is being shed.</p>
                            <p>“I am glad to observe that your excellency acquits her Majesty’s
                                government of adopting intentionally such a policy as you describe,
                                and I have consequently only to deal with the practical point of
                                view which brings me to consider the following question: Did Great
                                Britain, when she found herself in the position of a neutral in face
                                of a sudden and unexpected war, adopt an unusual policy and one
                                unwarranted by precedent? Was her attitude in any way exceptional?
                                There can be but one answer to this question. She adopted the course
                                for which she had the clearest and most unbroken <pb n="175"
                                    xml:id="pg_175" facs="0209"/>precedent and authority, foreign as
                                well as British; and which Prussia herself, as I have shown above,
                                has invariably adopted in similar cases.</p>
                            <p>‘‘I am ready to admit to the fullest extent the difficulty of
                                defining the rights of belligerents and the duties of neutrals, and
                                I fully recognize that the present feeling of the German nation is,
                                under the circumstances, not unnatural. I could not deny it,
                                considering the feelings which we ourselves entertained in times of
                                great excitement; but I do not for a moment doubt that Germany will,
                                at a calmer season, readily admit that, even if it had been
                                desirable, this country could not have been expected, without
                                general consent, to have altered the hitherto received rules by
                                which the duties of neutrals have been defined and regulated. Both
                                belligerents entered on the war with a full knowledge of the rules
                                of international law, and of what has been the almost uniform
                                practice of neutrals; and each belligerent had consequently a right
                                to expect that the existing rules and former practice would be
                                maintained, and might with reason have complained if any change had
                                been made.</p>
                            <p>“It must be remembered that obligations upon neutrals have become
                                more strict with the progress of civilization; but the present
                                question is one which was not raised or discussed at the congress of
                                Paris of 1856; and the royal commission, composed of some of the
                                most eminent jurisconsults in this country, who inquired into the
                                neutrality laws in 1867, decided that to prohibit the export of
                                munitions of war was impracticable and impolitic.</p>
                            <p>“Your excellency, turning from generality to details, has made
                                certain specific demands as to the course which Great Britain should
                                pursue. I think it right, therefore, to lay before you some
                                considerations with reference to these demands which may convince
                                you of the difficulty, if not impracticability, of acceding to
                                them.</p>
                            <p>“You demand that the export to France of arms, ammunition, coal, and
                                other contraband of war should be prevented; and you observe that
                                her Majesty’s government have declared that the law empowered the
                                executive to take this step.</p>
                            <p>“There is no doubt that the executive has, under the customs
                                consolidation act of 1853, the legal powder to prohibit the export
                                of contraband of war; but the highest authority can be adduced to
                                show that such exportation is not forbidden by our municipal law,
                                and it has not been the practice to prohibit it except when the
                                interests of this country, as in the case of self-defense, are
                                directly and immediately concerned in the prohibition: and even in
                                some of these cases, such as the Crimean war, considerable doubts
                                arose during its continuance whether the prohibition, when actually
                                attempted to be enforced, was as disadvantageous to the enemy as it
                                was inconvenient to ourselves.</p>
                            <p>“Such, then, being the state of the case as regards existing
                                practice, I would venture to ask your excellency’s serious attention
                                to the following specimens of the difficulties which would, at the
                                outset, have to be met in an attempt to alter existing practice.</p>
                            <p>“The export of arms and contraband of war may be open or clandestine.
                                Her Majesty’s government, though they regret it, do not for a moment
                                deny that there is at present a certain exportation of arms to
                                France; but this exportation is open and undisguised. Since the
                                dispatch of my note of the 9th instant, fuller customs returns have
                                been received, from which it appears that in the week immediately
                                following the declaration of war 11,000 rifles were shipped to
                                France. None are known to have been shipped since, with the
                                exception of the 4,512 taken by the Fannie from Southampton on the
                                6th instant; but it is possible that further purchases have been
                                made by French agents, though, from the reports received as to the
                                number in the market and the state of the gun trade, it is certain
                                that the purchases must have been very limited. But, whatever the
                                amount, there has been no secrecy in the export, and the returns of
                                every rifle shipped are as well known to your excellency as to her
                                Majesty’s government. Exportations, if prohibited, would be entirely
                                clandestine; the nature of a cargo and the destination of a vessel
                                would be equally concealed. It would be necessary to alter the
                                present system of exportation under which (except in the port of
                                London) cargoes, in order to insure rapidity of shipment, are not
                                examined by the customs authorities, who receive the account of them
                                from the shippers, generally after the ship has sailed. It would
                                require the establishment of an expensive, intricate, and
                                inquisitorial customs system under which all suspicious packages, no
                                matter what their assumed destination, would be opened and examined.
                                Finally, though it may certainly diminish the profits of certain
                                merchants, with whose proceedings her Majesty’s government, in
                                common with your excellency, have no sympathy, it would also cause
                                infinite delay and obstruction to innocent trade.</p>
                            <p>“Your excellency would not interfere with the trade to neutral
                                countries; but how would it be possible to avoid this? A ship
                                carrying prohibited articles would invariably have a colorable
                                neutral destination. How is this to be detected without interfering
                                with the trade with neutrals, if even then? During the Crimean war
                                Prussia had no such difficulty. There could be no doubt of the
                                destination of goods arriving on the Russian frontier; and yet the
                                customs authorities were practically powerless. But Great Britain
                                has no frontier; a ship leaving her ports may shape her course where
                                she pleases. Your excellency has suggested the exaction of a bond
                                from <pb n="176" xml:id="pg_176" facs="0210"/>shippers; but such a
                                measure would be most onerous to the mercantile community, would be
                                easily evaded, and at the best would be no security against ultimate
                                destination. It would be necessary, too, to take these bonds, not
                                only from foreign-bound ships, but from coasting vessels, which are
                                at present subject to little or no customs supervision; for what
                                could hinder a coasting vessel from crossing the channel and
                                delivering her cargo at a French port?</p>
                            <p>“Again, your excellency includes coal among the articles to be
                                prohibited, on the ground that coal is more useful to France than to
                                Germany during the present war. This raises the question of the
                                prohibition of all articles, not contraband of war, which might be
                                of service to a belligerent. But if this principle were admitted,
                                where is it to stop? In the American war no cargoes would have been
                                more useful to the Southern States than cloth, leather, and quinine.
                                It would be difficult for a neutral, and obviously inadmissible for
                                a belligerent, to draw the line.</p>
                            <p>“It must be remembered, too, that the features of the war may change.
                                Articles invaluable to a belligerent at one period may be valueless
                                at another, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> Is the neutral to
                                watch the shifting phases and vary his restrictions in accordance
                                with them?</p>
                            <p>“Again, the eleventh article of the treaty of commerce between this
                                country and France expressly provides that the contracting parties
                                shall not prohibit the exportation of coal. Can this solemn treaty
                                stipulation be lightly disregarded as long as we remain neutral?</p>
                            <p>“I have pointed out these difficulties to your excellency, as the
                                consideration of them may tend to efface the impression that Great
                                Britain has hastily and inconsiderately, or upon grounds of a narrow
                                selfishness, refused to accede to your demands; and I need hardly
                                assure you that at the outbreak of hostilities her Majesty’s
                                government were actuated in the course adopted by them by no feeling
                                of hostility toward a nation with which Great Britain has always
                                been on terms of intimate friendship, and by no unworthy motive of
                                retaliation for past conduct, but by the honest desire to maintain a
                                strict and impartial neutrality, in accordance with precedent and in
                                conformity with the law of nations.</p>
                            <p>“I trust that I have shown that our conduct has been of the nature
                                indicated. I have shown that we have conformed to existing practice,
                                and I have pointed out the difficulties standing in the way of the
                                alteration of existing practice. I have alluded to the difficulties
                                which the Prussian government encountered when placed in a position
                                analogous to that now occupied by Great Britain, and I have shown
                                that these difficulties were chiefly owing to their having so far
                                departed from existing practice as to prohibit the transit trade—a
                                concession which gave Great Britain a standing ground for complaint
                                which she would not otherwise have possessed, and which,
                                notwithstanding, was powerless in its results. I have also fully
                                recognized that the sensitiveness of the Prussian people and the
                                complaints of the government are natural.</p>
                            <p>“Her Majesty’s government fear that no means could be devised for
                                securing at this moment a calm discussion of the subject. They by no
                                means desire to claim exceptional rights for this country. They
                                would be prepared to enter into consultation with other nations as
                                to the possibility of adopting in common a stricter rule, although
                                their expectations of a practical result in the sense indicated by
                                the North German government are not sanguine.</p>
                            <p>“We took the course which appeared to be according to the dictates of
                                practice and precedent, at a time when it was impossible to know how
                                the fortune of war would turn. Since then, France, notwithstanding
                                the display of her usual courage and gallantry, has met with nothing
                                but reverses. Germany, has, on the other hand, given extraordinary
                                proofs of her military ability and power, accompanied, as it has
                                been, by continuous success. Your excellency, as the representative
                                of a great and chivalrous nation, must agree with me that it would
                                not be possible that we should now change the policy which we
                                declared to our Parliament to be usual, just, and expedient, because
                                it was stated by the victorious belligerent to be in some degree
                                favorable to the defeated enemy.</p>

                                the receipt of your excellency’s note of the 15th ultimo, in reply
                                to my memorandum of the 30th of August concerning British
                                neutrality. I have left it unanswered for a time, because for the
                                moment hopes of peace appeared to offer, and as I should have much
                                preferred to discontinue the controversy altogether. These hopes
                                having, however, I sincerely regret, disappeared for the present, I
                                cannot but reply to your excellency’s note.</p>
                            <p>“Before entering upon its contents, I ask your excellency’s
                                permission to say a few words regarding the form and origin of this
                                correspondence.</p>
                            <p>“The memorandum of the 30th of August, which I had the honor to
                                transmit to your excellency with a private letter of the 31st of the
                                same month, was originally not intended for publicity, as may easily
                                be perceived by some of its passages. I afterward, indeed, acceded
                                to your excellency’s wish to deal with it officially, and will
                                therefore not complain of your excellency’s having immediately
                                caused your reply to be published by the press simultaneously with
                                my memorandum before I had been allowed time to remove certain
                                evident misconceptions, and hence before the correspondence could be
                                regarded as closed.</p>
                            <p>“The circumstances under which the memorandum was written were as
                                follows:</p>
                            <p>“My verbal and written remonstrances on account of the direct supply
                                of the French fleet with coals, and on account of the export of arms
                                and ammunition to France, had remained without any practical
                                result.</p>
                            <p>“Your excellency had, it is true, promised that as soon as I could
                                adduce proofs of a certain vessel being hired by or for the French
                                government, in order to be used as a storeship in its service, the
                                case should receive consideration. Notwithstanding this promise,
                                your excellency declined acceding to my request of the 19th of
                                August to proceed against the vessels Hypathia and Norseman, merely
                                on the ground that these vessels had sailed before the foreign
                                enlistment act had come into operation. The two other points,
                                however, proved by undeniable evidence, namely, that both vesssls
                                had sailed under the British flag after conclusion of the sale, and
                                that, even up to the 8th ultimo, the transfer of the property to the
                                French owners had not been entered on the ships’ books, while the
                                sale had taken place about the middle of the month of July, have
                                been passed over in silence by your excellency, although the
                                two-fold violation of the international law and of the English law
                                had been clearly established.</p>
                            <pb n="178" xml:id="pg_178" facs="0212"/>
                            <p>“The notes in which I had submitted to your excellency several cases
                                which had become known of contemplated or already accomplished open
                                and clandestine consignments of arms and ammunition to France, in
                                order to afford an opportunity to her Britannic Majesty’s government
                                of preventing them or obviating the further extension of the
                                mischief, met with the same fate. Your excellency had assured me, in
                                the replies to my communications on the subject, that they should be
                                taken into immediate consideration, or that inquiries should be made
                                at once. But none of your excellency’s notes contained a positive
                                statement to the effect that her Britannic Majesty’s government
                                regarded the traffic in contraband of war compatible with their
                                neutrality and that they could not interfere. On the contrary, it
                                has been repeatedly left to me to search after particular cases with
                                the means at my disposal, in order to bring them under the notice of
                                her Majesty’s government.</p>
                            <p>“I should have been glad, indeed, if your excellency had, by a
                                categorical official declaration, placed me in a position to release
                                the consular agents of the North German Confederation in the United
                                Kingdom from the laborious and unpleasant task of controlling this
                                illegitimate traffic.</p>
                            <p>“Your excellency will especially please to recollectthat subsequent
                                to the indiscretion of Count Palikao, which created a great
                                sensation, not only in Germany, but also in this country, your
                                excellency, far from declaring the dispatch of 40,000 breech-loaders
                                for the French army to be compatible with strict neutrality, stated
                                that it would be impossible to interfere unless I adduced positive
                                proofs that those consignments had really been made. At least your
                                excellency’s notes of the 25th and 26th of August, in reply to my
                                note of the 25th, justified such conclusion on my part. For, in the
                                first note, your excellency expressed the apprehension that my
                                communications not containing more precise statements of the name of
                                the ship having on board part of the arms in question, and of the
                                particular place in the river where the vessel was lying, the
                                inquiry would be difficult. And, in the second note, your excellency
                                informed me that the investigations had remained without result.</p>
                            <p>“After waiting in vain for the promulgation of an ‘order in council,’
                                or for any official announcement on the part of her Britannic
                                Majesty’s government, or for instructions to the police, customs,
                                and harbor authorities of the United Kingdom, but having meanwhile
                                ascertained, by means of reliable communications, that the
                                consignments announced by Count Palikao were being actively carried
                                on, I embodied my views of the political bearing of the question in
                                the memorandum, in order to show distinctly to the British cabinet,
                                in a most unofficial form, the impression necessarily created in
                                Germany by the toleration of the export of arms to France. I have
                                since then been almost daily in a position to draw your excellency’s
                                attention to various instances of consignments of arms. In reply to
                                my notes on the subject, I for a long time either received no
                                answers at all, or only such as were dilatory, although the cases
                                acknowledged in your excellency’s subsequent notes of the 13th and
                                19th ultimo prove that her Britannic Majesty’s government would have
                                had time to prevent the dispatch of many a thousand of rifles to
                                France.</p>
                            <p>“It is true, your excellency, on the 5th ultimo, in reply to my note
                                of the 2d ultimo, informed me that some of the packages in a certain
                                truck on a railway, pointed out by me, contained bacon. But besides
                                the possibility of other packages, which had not been opened, having
                                contained arms, and of my having been misinformed only in regard to
                                the particular number of the railway truck, I could, <hi
                                    rend="italic">e contrario</hi>, draw the conclusion from your
                                excellency’s communication that her Britannic Majesty’s government
                                would have complied with my request if those packages had contained
                                arms instead of bacon. However, after I had succeeded by my notes of
                                the 1st, 2d, 3d, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th ultimo, in bringing a series
                                of irrefutable facts before her Britannic Majesty’s government, a
                                sudden change occurred. In your note of the 13th ultimo, while
                                acknowledging the correctness of a large number of cases pointed out
                                by me, your excellency declared that the traffic, which had been
                                quite openly carried on, was legitimate, and that the customs
                                authorities had no power to stop it. Had her Majesty’s government
                                from the commencement of this discussion taken this standing ground,
                                they would certainly not have induced me to institute the above
                                inquiries, and far less would they have had reason to subject the
                                correctness of my informations to a practical test.</p>
                            <p>“I therefore consider myself justified in concluding that her
                                Britannic Majesty’s government, since the receipt of my memorandum,
                                has materially changed the position previously occupied in regard of
                                our complaints. It was unavoidable that this change should be
                                reflected in the answer to my memorandum, penned under different
                                conditions. For I had started with the supposition that the legal
                                means at the disposal of the executive had hitherto not been applied
                                simply from motives of convenience. I had been under the impression
                                that it would only be necessary to prove the serious extent of the
                                supply of France with arms and ammunition on the part of England in
                                order to convince the British government that the time had arrived
                                to make use of their powers. I had, therefore, not entered upon a
                                judicial examination of the question of English neutrality, not
                                because I had reason to shun its discussion, but merely <pb n="179"
                                    xml:id="pg_179" facs="0213"/>because I had hoped that by
                                abstaining from it I should be bringing about a more rapid practical
                                decision, and therefore considered it sufficient to restrict myself
                                to the practical and political aspect of the question.</p>
                            <p>“I now have the honor to refer to your excellency’s note of the 15th
                                ultimo, and must begin by contradicting the supposition that I had
                                expressed a desire on the part of my government that the attitude of
                                Great Britain toward Germany in this war should be that of a
                                ‘benevolent neutrality.’ On the contrary, as a repeated and careful
                                examination of my arguments in their mutual connection, will
                                convince your excellency, I have, on the one hand merely given
                                expression to my satisfaction that public opinion had ranged itself
                                on our side in this war, wantonly thrust upon us, and had, on the
                                other hand, combined with it the reflection how difficult it is to
                                reconcile the faith in the practical value of public opinion with
                                the neutrality policy actually pursued by her Britannic Majesty’s
                                government.</p>
                            <p>“I have by no means asked, and far less claimed, on our part, that
                                England should transgress the bounds of a strict neutrality in our
                                favor and to the detriment of France. But I have asserted, and, in
                                the face of the experiences of the last few weeks, as well as in
                                consequence of your excellency’s note of the 15th ultimo, must
                                maintain my assertion that the neutrality of England, while, as I am
                                most willing to admit, intended to be impartial, in its practical
                                effects assumes the form of a neutrality which is benevolent and
                                partial toward France. For my part, I have only wished a return from
                                a lax neutrality, whereby one party is benefited, to a strict and
                                really impartial neutrality; for I am unable to admit that it is
                                compatible with strict neutrality that French agents should be
                                permitted to buy up in this country, under the eyes and with the
                                cognizance of her Britannic Majesty’s government, many thousands of
                                breechloaders, revolvers, and pistols, with the requisite
                                ammunition, in order to arm therewith the French people, and make
                                the formation of fresh army corps possible after the regular armies
                                of France have been defeated and surrounded.</p>
                            <p>“Your excellency admits that the export of arms and ammunition to
                                France has latterly assumed larger proportions than had hitherto
                                appeared credible. I have the honor to remark that, according to my
                                information, which may be partly tested upon oath, if this should
                                appear desirable, the number of fire-arms shipped from England to
                                France since my memorandum of the 30th ultimo, is treble and
                                four-fold the number of 40,000, announced by Count Palikao, and that
                                a number of manufactories, especially in Birmingham and London, are
                                working day and night for French agents and their men of straw. I am
                                in possession of authenticated copies of contracts, concluded
                                between the French government and English contractors. The events of
                                the war have quite recently delivered into our hands an official
                                letter of the present French minister of war, dated the 18th ultimo,
                                to a French officer at the French embassy in London, and in which
                                the then expected dispatch of 25,000 Snider rifles is mentioned, and
                                reference is made for the payment to the funds at the disposal of
                                the French chargé d’affaires for the purchase of arms in general. In
                                like manner authentic proofs lie before me that the export of
                                fire-arms and ammunition to France has been thoroughly organized in
                                some British ports.</p>
                            <p>“Since, however, as already alluded to, her Britannic Majesty’s
                                government, relinquishing its former standing ground, does not doubt
                                the actual legitimacy of these consignments of arms, but disputes
                                the validity of our complaints concerning the toleration of these
                                facts from a judicial and political point of view, I shall now
                                proceed to an enumeration of the arguments contained in your
                                excellency’s note of the 15th ultimo.</p>
                            <p>“According to your excellency’s own admission, the executive has the
                                power to prohibit the export of contraband of war. But you state the
                                practice is to make use of this right only in the interest of
                                England, as in the case of self-defense. A letter of the Duke of
                                Wellington to Mr. Canning, dated the 30th of August, 1825, and
                                reprinted in a London newspaper immediately after the indiscretion
                                of Count Palikao, refutes this assumption, proving that England as a
                                neutral has repeatedly prohibited the export of arms by an order in
                                council, ‘according to the usual practice,’ as the renowned duke
                                says. In one part of this letter the words occur, ‘I am afraid,
                                then, that the world will not entirely acquit us of at least not
                                doing our utmost to prevent this breach of neutrality of which the
                                Porte will accuse us.’</p>
                            <p>“Practice, consequently, is in itself not opposed to the adoption of
                                a measure desired by us for the prohibition of the sale of arms to
                                our enemy. But the law allows government a certain latitude of
                                consideration to make use of their power according to circumstances.
                                Your excellency is, however, of opinion that the present customs
                                system would require a radical reform in order to prevent the export
                                of contraband of war. I gladly concede that the lax method of
                                dispatch and control on the part of the custom-house authorities,
                                which has become usual in the interest of an unfettered commercial
                                intercourse, bars the energetic carrying out of a measure
                                prohibiting the exportation of contraband of war. But, on the other
                                hand, I think the very fact of such laxity tends to show that, for
                                the purpose of rendering an order in council effectual, no new
                                organization would be required, but simply more stringent
                                instructions <pb n="180" xml:id="pg_180" facs="0214"/>for the
                                customs and harbor authorities, reminding them of the existing
                                regulations. The correctness of this opinion is founded upon the
                                numerous official reports and other partly sworn evidence lying
                                before me. They clearly prove that many thousands of boxes,
                                containing rifles, well known to be such by the custom-house
                                authorities, have been shipped for France without challenge. I know
                                several instances where the cases have not even been registered in
                                the books, but have been openly shipped as passengers’ luggage by
                                the French agents. When our consular agents protested against such
                                proceedings, the custom-house officers invariably replied that they
                                had no instructions to detain the packages.</p>
                            <p>“I hope, however, to be able to prove by the following passages in
                                English statutes that her Britannic Majesty’s government have at
                                their disposal, in case they should wish to avail themselves of
                                them, the means to put a stop to this traffic without the necessity
                                of introducing a new machinery of officials for the purpose.</p>
                            <p>“By the 150th section of chapter 107 of the customs consolidation act
                                1853, (16 and 17 Victoria,) it is enacted that—</p>
                            <p>“‘The following goods may, by proclamation or order in council, be
                                prohibited either to be exported or carried coastwise: Arms,
                                ammunition, and gunpowder, &amp;c.; and if any goods so prohibited
                                shall be exported from the United Kingdom, or carried coastwise or
                                by water borne to be so exported, they shall be forfeited.’</p>
                            <p>“Section 125 of the same act enacts—</p>
                            <p>“‘That the exporter of British manufactures, or his agents, has to
                                declare, in a shipping bill, the marks, numbers, description of
                                packages, and the quantity, quality, and description of goods about
                                to be shipped for exportation.’</p>
                            <p>“Section 5 of the 122d chapter of the 17 and 18 Victoria (1854)
                                enacts—</p>
                            <p>“‘That on the entry at the customs of arms and ammunition of war,
                                “whether for home use, exportation, or in transit, the number of
                                articles of each description, as denominated in Table A, (swords,
                                bayonets, muskets, rifles, carbines, cannons, mortars, &amp;c.,)
                                shall be stated in the import, export, or transit entry.’</p>
                            <p>“The passage, therefore, in your excellency’s note that ‘such
                                exportation is not forbidden by our municipal law,’ can but have the
                                meaning that a positive declaration is still required on the part of
                                her Britannic Majesty’s government before the power with which it is
                                invested comes into operation.</p>
                            <p>“The second passage of the quoted enactment proves that the means for
                                an efficient control have likewise been provided by the law itself.
                                It is true the intention must exist to apply the remedy. That,
                                however, the action of her Majesty’s government does not always
                                remain the same under all circumstances I may be permitted to prove
                                by two instructions issued to the customs authorities of the United
                                Kingdom on the 2d of June, 1848, and the 8th of September, 1870,
                                respectively.</p>
                            <p>“The first originated at the time of the Danish-German complications,
                                when Sir Charles Trevelyan, one of the secretaries to the lords
                                commissioners of her Majesty’s treasury, informed the commissioners
                                of customs, in a treasury minute, that ‘in transmitting to them
                                copies of a letter received by their lordships from the foreign
                                office, and of its inclosures from the Danish minister to this
                                court, he has been commanded by their lordships to desire that if
                                the commissioner shall be satisfied that any arms or war like stores
                                are embarked to be sent from this country for the purpose of being
                                employed in hostilities against the Danish government, they will
                                give instructions to their officers to prevent their exportation.’
                                In pursuance of this order of the lords of the treasury, the
                                commissioners of the customs issued directions to their officers at
                                the several departments in the port of London, and to all the
                                collectors and controllers of all the ports throughout the kingdom,
                                to take care that the same be duly obeyed, with instructions to make
                                a special ‘report to the board of any circumstances that may arise
                                fit for their cognizance.’</p>

                                continued complaints since the middle of July in this year, are as

                                sufficient to obtain the above particulars. A report to be made to
                                the board in each case.</p>
                            <p>“‘I am, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                                and calls for no comment on my part. At the time I wrote my
                                memorandum and the above-mentioned numerous notes to your
                                excellency, I was naturally not acquainted with the instructions <pb

                                however, that I am entitled to contend that they prove conclusively
                                how easy it would have been for her Britannic Majesty’s government
                                to render the control which has been ordered for their own
                                information effective also with regard to my complaints, without
                                damaging the usual and legitimate trade of the country.</p>
                            <p>“I had, on a former occasion, taken the liberty to propose to your
                                excellency still another remedy, which appeared to me appropriate
                                for guarding the <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> commerce with
                                other neutral countries against unnecessary annoyance without in its
                                interest setting aside all and every control.</p>
                            <p>“This measure would consist in demanding securities that articles
                                cleared for a neutral port should really be delivered there. Your
                                excellency considers this proposal impracticable. I beg permission,
                                however, to quote a passage from a French law of the 14th of July,
                                1860—‘Law concerning the manufacture and sale of arms for war
                                purposes,’ which has been reprinted in the appendix to the Report of
                                the Neutrality Laws Commissioners of 1867—</p>
                            <p>“It says, at page 48 of the report, under the head of Title 2, No.
                                9:</p>
                            <p>“‘The export of arms or pieces of arms for warfare is free, under the
                                conditions laid down by the law, or by the regulations of the
                                administrative authorities.</p>
                            <p>“‘An imperial decree may, however, forbid this exportation beyond the
                                frontiers for a fixed destination and limited period.</p>
                            <p>“‘The custom-house officers through which the export may be made are
                                named by decrees for the purpose.</p>
                            <p>“‘When the export is prohibited for certain points of destination the
                                exporters must, under the penalties imposed by article 4 of section
                                3 of the law of August 22, 1791, certify the arrival of the arms at
                                a legitimate point of destination by means of bonds, which on
                                departure are delivered to them by the customs authorities, and
                                canceled on arrival at the port of destination by the consular
                                agents of France.’</p>
                            <p>“My proposal, therefore, if it has not the merit of originality,
                                enjoys at least the advantage of being recognized as practicable by
                                the French legislature. France could consequently least of all have
                                been in the position to see any kind of unfriendliness in the
                                application of the remedy.</p>
                            <p>“Notwithstanding a careful study of the quoted ‘Report of the
                                Neutrality Laws Commissioners,’ I have not been able to find the
                                proof in it that this commission had come to the decision that a
                                prohibition of the export of arms and ammunition was, indeed,
                                impracticable or impolitic. Besides, the authority of the commission
                                would scarcely have extended far enough to prejudice (by such a
                                decision) all future contingencies and the rights of other nations.
                                I believe, however, I have proved that a prohibition of export is
                                legally admissible, and practicable as well as possible, in the
                                usual course of administration. Whether it is politic or not, that
                                is the very question on which a difference of opinion exists between
                                us up to the present time.</p>
                            <p>“The second objection of your excellency to the legitimacy of our
                                complaints is the alleged wrong on the part of Prussia during the
                                Crimean war. I do not wish to recur to the greater or less degree of
                                analogy between both the cases in question, as a continuation of
                                this controversy especially before the public might create feelings
                                in one or other of the two nations which I am most anxious to
                                avoid.</p>
                            <p>“However that may be, and even if the most complete analogy existed
                                and had been acknowledged by me, I still could not refrain from
                                upholding the alternative that if the complaints of England against
                                Prussia at the time of the Crimean war were warranted, those of
                                Germany against England at the present time are at least equally
                                well founded.</p>
                            <p>“As regards your excellency’s arguments by which the dilemma is to be
                                obviated, I wish to make a single reply. Your excellency
                                remarks:</p>
                            <p>“‘The course of Great Britain, then and now, is perfectly consistent.
                                As she then remonstrated against infractions of Prussian law, so she
                                now admits the justice of remonstrances against infractions of
                                British law, such as store-ships, enlistments, and others.’</p>
                            <p>“In another place your excellency says:</p>
                            <p>“‘I have alluded to the difficulties which the Prussian government
                                encountered when placed in a position analogous to that occupied by
                                Great Britain, and I have shown that those difficulties were chiefly
                                owing to their having so far departed from existing practice as to
                                prohibit the transit trade, a concession which gave Great Britain a
                                standing ground for complaints which she would not otherwise have
                                possessed, and which, notwithstanding, was powerless in its
                                results.’</p>
                            <p>“It is evident that the justice of former complaints against us is
                                deduced from a concession made by Prussia to England and her allies
                                in excess of its strict obligations as a neutral, while our present
                                grievances are stated to be unfounded because England has not made
                                concessions of any kind in excess of its bare duties of neutrality,
                                and merely concedes to us a right of complaint in so far as the
                                violation of English law is concerned.</p>
                            <p>“If I should at all draw a conclusion from this line of argument, it
                                could only be <pb n="182" xml:id="pg_182" facs="0216"/>that Prussia
                                did at that time more in principle for the observation of the
                                neutrality than England does at present, and therefore evinced at
                                that time a more friendly neutrality toward England than the latter
                                now observes toward us, and that, therefore, the complaints of
                                England were then less warranted than ours now are.</p>
                            <p>“As regards the practical observation of the existing laws and
                                regulations, I shall not revert to the numerous complaints of
                                England on account of alleged transport of arms through Prussia, of
                                which I have still a perfect recollection, and which at the time
                                were proved unfounded.</p>
                            <p>“On the other hand, I must draw attention to the infractions of
                                British law, as shown above, even in its present state, in order to
                                prove that our complaints certainly have, in this respect also, a
                                foundation based on facts.</p>
                            <p>“In addition, I cannot refrain from opposing the principle involved
                                in your excellency’s argument, For I am of opinion that the right of
                                the belligerent powers to complain about the attitude of a neutral
                                state does not so much originate in its accidental municipal law as
                                in the international law with which it is the duty of every
                                government to bring its own laws into harmony.</p>
                            <p>“This is the very standing ground of Germany. According to the
                                existing principles of international law, arms and ammunition rank
                                first among the articles which are regarded as contraband of war,
                                and the sale of which to the belligerent powers contributes most
                                toward feeding and protracting the war.</p>
                            <p>“The reference to the Crimean war could, therefore, only be
                                considered an argument for the position of her Britannic Majesty’s
                                government if they should insist upon the analogy denied by me, and
                                deduce therefrom the right to return our alleged former wrong by a
                                positive wrong at the present moment.</p>
                            <p>“I have in my memorandum already too strongly declared the
                                possibility of such a supposition to be at variance with the liberal
                                and conciliatory ideas of the English people and statesmen to make
                                any particular allusion necessary to the injurious effects which the
                                reintroduction of the principle of retaliation would necessarily
                                have upon the progress and the peace of Europe. I may the more
                                readily refrain from doing so, as your excellency has, on your own
                                part, emphatically repudiated such an idea.</p>
                            <p>“In the same manner I may abstain from entering at present upon the
                                question whether it would be more in the interest of all to extend
                                or restrict the duties of neutrals in the future.</p>
                            <p>“That Germany inclines to every progress in the field of increasing
                                active freedom it has already proved in the course of three wars by
                                applying, reciprocally, in the Danish and the Austrian wars, and,
                                without regard to reciprocity, in the present war, the principle
                                aimed at by the majority of the whole commercial world, namely, the
                                security of private property at sea, a principle the adoption of
                                which proved to be unattainable at the congress of Paris in 1856.
                                Germany has therefore the more reason to expect from the other
                                powers that they should not selfishly alter the existing
                                international rights to its detriment and their own advantage.</p>
                            <p>“The present controversy simply centers in the question whether the
                                refusal of her Majesty’s government to prohibit the export of arms
                                is not at variance with the still unaltered general rules of
                                international law regarding the duties of neutrals toward
                                belligerents, and with the laws of this country not yet repealed by
                                the legislature for the better fulfillment of these duties. That
                                such is the case I believe I have proved by the existing facts and
                                the laws themselves.</p>
                            <p>“I will now try and remove the final obstacle, which, according to
                                the concluding paragraph of your excellency’s note, dated the 15th
                                ultimo, has prevented her Britannic Majesty’s government from
                                issuing an order prohibiting the export of arms.</p>
                            <p>“Your excellency remarks that France has suffered only defeats, while
                                Germany, on the other hand, exhibits uninterrupted successes, and
                                you connect therewith the reflection that it would be contrary to
                                the feelings of her Britannic Majesty’s government now to change a
                                line of policy entered upon at a time when they could not know which
                                side would be favored by the fortune of war.</p>
                            <p>“In the first instance I should wish to raise the objection hereto
                                that the government of her Britannic Majesty brought the new foreign
                                enlistment act before Parliament after the outbreak of the war, and
                                that when advocating the bill they emphatically declared that the
                                laws hitherto in force would not be altered thereby, but merely
                                supplemented.</p>
                            <p>“If, however, it cannot be doubtful, on the one hand, that in
                                existing circumstances the new law is only beneficial to France,
                                rendering it impossible for Germany to get ships, which she needed
                                most urgently, while on the other hand the executive now refuses to
                                apply the old laws for the prevention of export of arms and
                                ammunition to France, and hereby the United Kingdom becomes a great
                                arsenal for our enemy, the new law assumes in consequence of this a
                                character, as regards Germany, which, if not hostile, is practically
                                malevolent. But this, as I have the satisfaction to know, and as is
                                proved by the parliamentary debates, was not the intention of the
                                legislature.</p>
                            <p>“I further have the honor to remark that our complaints of the manner
                                in which the English neutrality laws are being administered date
                                from a time when we had not yet <pb n="183" xml:id="pg_183"
                                    facs="0217"/>gained any victories, and that they were in no wise
                                first raised by my memorandum of the 30th of August. Moreover, at
                                the time the memorandum was penned France still possessed two
                                powerful armies, while her fleets commanded the Baltic and North
                                Sea, so that it could not possibly be a matter of indifference to us
                                whether England, by the exercise of her neutrality, materially
                                increased the advantages which France derived from our want of
                                control of the sea.</p>
                            <p>“But even under the present circumstances the German people would not
                                easily be persuaded that it was wanting in chivalry because it
                                complains that by an unrestricted export of arms the enemy, who had
                                been overcome only by its own great sacrifices, is furnished with
                                the means of prolonging a struggle which, even if its final result
                                should not thereby be materially affected, still in any case must
                                lead to more bloodshed and more sacrifices for both belligerents.
                                Even the most eloquent defender of the position taken by her
                                Britannic Majesty’s government will not succeed, in the eyes of
                                Germany, in bringing such a neutrality policy into harmony with the
                                considerations of humanity and the wishes for peace so frequently
                                advocated by England.</p>
                            <p>“As for the hope expressed by your excellency that the German people
                                will, in a cooler moment, judge less severely the attitude of the
                                government of Great Britain in this question than now in the heat of
                                action, I regret that, in consequence of your excellency’s note of
                                the 15th ultimo, added to the knowledge that our enemy is being
                                daily equipped with British arms, I cannot share it.</p>
                            <p>“Should this state of things continue, I could only look forward to
                                the soothing influence which the numerous and actual proofs of
                                sympathy given by the English people, and the manifold testimonies
                                of public opinion in favor of Germany and its good right, may have
                                upon the feelings of the German nation.</p>

                                instant.</p>
                            <p>“The friendly spirit of your reply to the observations which I
                                addressed to you on the <pb n="184" xml:id="pg_184" facs="0218"
                                />15th ultimo, on the subject of the attitude of this country as a
                                neutral, and the attention which you have evidently given to the
                                arguments and explanations which I placed before you, encouraged her
                                Majesty’s government in the belief that the calm discussion by the
                                two governments of the difficult question of the claims of
                                belligerents upon neutrals is calculated to remove present
                                misunderstandings, and possibly to pave the way for an eventual
                                solution. I have also to thank your excellency for having pointed
                                out certain apparent breaches in the chain of practice which I had
                                described as forming an unbroken precedent for the course now
                                adopted, and thus afforded me an opportunity for giving such further
                                explanations as will establish, beyond a doubt, its consistency.</p>
                            <p>“The policy of her Majesty’s government, and the grounds on which it
                                is based, were so fully explained in my former note that I need not
                                again advert to the subject, further than to observe that your
                                excellency is wrong in supposing that at any time a change took
                                place in that policy. From the date of the outbreak of the war the
                                cabinet has never hesitated as to the course which should be
                                pursued. The views of the House of Commons were clearly manifested
                                when, on the 4th of August, an amendment, by which it was proposed
                                to insert in the foreign enlistment act, then under discussion, a
                                clause prohibiting the exportation to belligerents of arms or
                                munitions of war was rejected by a large majority; and the same
                                opinions were shown to be held in the House of Lords in the debate
                                of the 8th of August on the same bill, in which the lord chancellor,
                                the lord privy seal, and Lord Cairns took part. I myself, in answer
                                to a question addressed to me in the House of Lords by the Marquis
                                of Clanricarde on the 22d of July, went so far as to express some
                                doubts whether a policy of prohibition was advisable even in
                                self-defense; and in the constant conversations on the subject which
                                I have had with your excellency since the commencement of the war, I
                                have invariably explained to you that the new foreign enlistment act
                                neither diminished nor added to the powers of the government as
                                regarded the exportation of munitions of war, and that it was our
                                intention to adhere on that point to the usual practice of this
                                country, which practice we believe to be in conformity with the
                                established principles of public law.</p>
                            <p>“I had supposed that from those various sources of information your
                                excellency would have been in a position fully to acquaint the North
                                German government with the attitude which this country might be
                                expected to maintain, and it is therefore with surprise that I have
                                learnt that, previously to the receipt of my note of the 15th
                                ultimo, you had doubts upon the subject. I can find nothing in my
                                earlier notes to which you refer which could lead to the inference
                                that there was any hesitation on the part of her Majesty’s
                                government; those notes, written in reply to specific statements
                                made by your excellency respecting alleged exportations of munitions
                                of war, contained merely the acknowledgments which were due to your
                                excellency as a matter of courtesy promises of inquiry into facts,
                                and brief reports of the results of investigations.</p>
                            <p>“Your excellency appears to take exception to my having instituted
                                inquiries at all, but upon this point I most respectfully differ.
                                Whatever view may be taken of the principle on which the government
                                has acted, it is right that the facts should be correctly
                                ascertained. Wild rumors have been in circulation as to the extent
                                to which arms are being supplied by this country to France; bitter
                                articles founded on these rumors have been inserted in the German
                                newspapers; your excellency based upon them frequent and strong
                                representations, and her Majesty’s government might, in my opinion,
                                fairly be accused of supineness and neglect if, at the meeting of
                                Parliament, they should be so ill-informed as to be unable to supply
                                any information upon this point. It was possible, moreover, that the
                                shipments of arms might have been of such a nature as to bring them
                                within the operation of the clauses of the foreign enlistment act
                                forbidding the dispatch of store-ships or the fitting out of
                                military or naval expeditions. It was for these reasons that I felt
                                it to be my duty to investigate any statements brought to my notice
                                by your excellency, and not to allow them, if unsupported, to pass
                                unchallenged.</p>
                            <p>“The necessity for this inquiry will be the more obvious when the
                                complaints made from time to time by your excellency are compared
                                with the answers which I have returned to them; and I may here
                                observe that, before returning those answers, I have taken
                                exhaustive steps to test their accuracy, by obtaining independent
                                information from the customs officials, from the board of trade,
                                from the police, and from the small-arms department of the war
                                office. I am not aware of the sources from which your excellency’s
                                information is derived. I do not, of course, suppose that any
                                importance would be attached by you to reports given in return for
                                pecuniary rewards, such as have been offered in newspaper
                                advertisements; but I think it cannot be doubted that the sources
                                which I have above enumerated are likely to be more trustworthy than
                                those to which the able and active consuls of the North German
                                Confederation have access.</p>
                            <p>“Your excellency observes that in your notes from the 1st to the 9th
                                of September you brought to my notice a series of irrefutable facts.
                                It must have escaped your notice that in my answer of the 9th of
                                that month I showed that the majority of those alleged facts were
                                unfounded.</p>

                            <p>“In your note to which I am now replying, you make two further
                                specific statements, the truth of which I have also felt it to be my
                                duty to investigate; that respecting the order supposed to have been
                                given by Count Palikao to a firm in this country on the 23d of
                                August for 40,000 rifles to be delivered within a week, and that in
                                which the number of fire-arms shipped from this country to France
                                between the 30th of August and the 8th instant is calculated at from
                                120,000 to 160,000. As regards the former, while observing in
                                passing that Count Palikao’s statement, as reported in the Journal
                                Officiel was merely that these arms had been ordered <hi
                                    rend="italic">à l’étranger,</hi> I have to state that no trace
                                can be discovered of the order ever having been received in this
                                country, and that it is certain that, if it was received, it was not
                                executed; and, as regards the latter, that the full returns now
                                before me show that the supplies of arms drawn by France from this
                                country between the two specified dates are less than those drawn by
                                her from the United States, whence no exports have been made
                                approaching the figures mentioned by your excellency. It is, indeed,
                                understood that there is now some activity at Birmingham in the
                                manufacture of fire-arms, owing to the increasing demand, but
                                experienced persons are of opinion that, in consequence of the
                                recent stagnation of the trade, its present producing power is very
                                limited.</p>
                            <p>“I may here remark that her Majesty’s government have learnt with
                                some surprise that, while your excellency has been instructed to
                                make such constant complaints on the, subject of the exports of
                                munitions of war from this country, no such instructions had, up to
                                a very recent date, been addressed to your colleague in the United
                                States, who had only made personal representations to the United
                                States Government, although the latter have adhered in the same
                                manner as her Majesty’s government to the principle and practice of
                                neutrals, and have consequently not interfered with the exports to
                                which I have above referred. The President of the United States, in
                                his proclamation of the 22d of August last, expressly states that
                                ‘the laws of the United States, without interfering with the free
                                expression of opinion and sympathy, or with the open manufacture or
                                sale of arms or munitions of war, nevertheless impose upon all
                                persons who may be within their territory and jurisdiction the duty
                                of an impartial neutrality during the existence of the contest.’</p>
                            <p>“I will next proceed to examine the fresh complaint preferred by you
                                against her Majesty’s government of violation of international and
                                British law, of which I trust that I can briefly dispose. Your
                                complaint refers to the sale of the Hypatia and Norseman to the
                                French government to be used as store-ships. Previously to the
                                receipt of your present note I had received but one communication
                                from you on this subject, that of the 19th of August, in reply to
                                which I informed you, on the 29th of the same month, that the
                                attention of her Majesty’s government had been already drawn by
                                their own officials to the circumstances of these sales, and that,
                                on investigation, it had been ascertained that in both cases the
                                vessels were dispatched from England before the foreign enlistment
                                act of 1870 came into operation, and that, consequently. the owners,
                                who were not liable to penalties under the previous enlistment act,
                                could not be successfully prosecuted under the provisions of the new
                                act. Having heard nothing further from your excellency on the
                                subject, I concluded that you were satisfied with this explanation;
                                but as I now learn that you are dissatisfied on certain points, I
                                think it due to you that I should explain that the information in
                                possession of her Majesty’s government shows that the vessels sailed
                                from England under the British flag because the actual sale was
                                effected at Cherbourg, at which port the vessels were handed over to
                                the purchasers before the passing of the new act. I do not
                                understand to what process your excellency refers in stating that
                                ‘up to the 8th ultimo the transfer of the property to the French
                                owners had not been entered on the ship’s books;’ but the steps
                                which the law requires were duly complied with by the vendors, the
                                certificates of registry having been given up in the month of August
                                to the proper officers with the notifications that the vessels had
                                been sold abroad. To your excellency’s remark, therefore, that I
                                ‘declined to proceed’ against these vessels, I have only to reply
                                that there was and is no ground whatsoever upon which a prosecution
                                could be based.</p>
                            <p>“I will not follow your excellency through the passages of your note
                                in which you show that her Majesty’s government have the power to
                                prohibit the export of arms, a fact which I have constantly stated
                                to you; nor do I think it necessary to refer to the passage in which
                                you quote the French law of the 14th of July, 1860, further than to
                                observe that the clauses of that law are, like those possessed by
                                the British executive, merely permissive, and that a system of bonds
                                is necessarily open to the objection that it merely serves to
                                enhance the price of the arms—a matter of little account when their
                                acquisition is of national importance.</p>
                            <p>“I may refer incidentally to your excellency’s remark that you do not
                                find in the printed report of the neutrality laws commissioners any
                                confirmation of my statement that the opinion of those commissioners
                                was, that to prohibit the export of munitions of war was
                                impracticable and impolitic. It is true that that opinion was not
                                embodied in their report; but it is none the less true that the
                                subject was discussed by the commission, and that the opinion
                                pronounced upon it was that which I have recorded, as <pb n="186"
                                    xml:id="pg_186" facs="0220"/>is shown by the report not
                                containing any recommendation of the alteration of the law in this
                                respect.</p>
                            <p>“I now come to the points in your excellency’s note which appear to
                                me to demand a full explanation. I had stated in my note of the 15th
                                that the practice of Great Britain, as a neutral, had always been
                                that which she now follows. Your excellency disputes this position,
                                and in support of your arguments you adduce two. documents— a letter
                                from the Duke of Wellington to Mr. Canning, dated the 30th of
                                August, 1825; and an instruction from the board of treasury to the
                                customs, dated the 2d of June 1848. I have not failed to examine
                                most carefully the instances which you specify and the following is
                                the result of the examination:</p>
                            <p>“A laborious search has failed to discover any trace of a letter from
                                the Duke of Wellington of the 30th of August, 1825; but a paper has
                                been found, dated August 3, 1826, which contains the passage quoted
                                by you. This paper is a minute written by the Duke of Wellington
                                upon a draught dispatch addressed by Mr. Secretary Canning to Mr.
                                Stratford Canning, then British ambassador at Constantinople, at the
                                time of the war between Turkey and Greece, in which, with reference
                                to a rumor that arms were being sent from England for the purpose of
                                equipping abroad vessels to be commanded by Lord Cochrane, in the
                                service of Greece, Sir. Canning stated that such a proceeding was
                                not contrary to law, and could not be prevented by her Majesty’s
                                government. To the latter part of this statement the Duke of
                                Wellington demurred, referring to the fact that, when Spain was at
                                war with her colonies, England had prohibited exports to both
                                belligerents, and making use of the words quoted by your
                                excellency.</p>
                            <p>“Mr. Canning, however, insisted on his view, stating, in his
                                rejoinder: ‘The law does permit the exportation of arms as
                                merchandise; and I must authorize Stratford so to say, if he is to
                                state the case of his country truly.’ The duke gave way, and no
                                order in council prohibiting the export of arms was issued by the
                                government.</p>
                            <p>“It is also incidentally important to observe that the precedent for
                                such a prohibition, to which reference was made by the duke, was one
                                in which Great Britain had no option in the matter. She had bound
                                herself by article 3 of the additional articles, signed at Madrid on
                                August 28, 1814, to the treaty with Spain of the 5th of July of the
                                same year, to ‘take the most effectual measures for preventing her
                                subjects from furnishing arms, ammunition, or any other warlike
                                article to the revolted in America;’ and being thus compelled, when
                                Spain was at war with her colonies, to prohibit the exportation of
                                arms to the latter, she subsequently extended the prohibition to
                                Spain herself, in order to avoid the imputation of favoring one
                                belligerent to the exclusion of the other.</p>
                            <p>“The second apparent instance adduced by your excellency of departure
                                from what I have stated, to be the ordinary practice of Great
                                Britain, is the issue of orders to the customs officials, on the 2d
                                of June, 1848, instructing them to prevent the exportation of arms
                                for the purpose of being employed in hostilities against the Danish
                                government. I shall have no difficulty in showing that there were
                                exceptional causes which made the issue of these instructions
                                imperative on her Majesty’s government.</p>
                            <p>“On the 25th of May, 1848, the Danish minister in London drew
                                attention to the fact that preparations were being made in this
                                country for sending cannon to Hamburg, and called on her Majesty’s
                                government, in accordance with the stipulations of the treaty bet
                                ween Great Britain and Denmark of 1670, to prevent those shipments
                                being made. The treaty appealed to was signed at Copenhagen on the
                                11th of July, 1670, was supplemented by an explanatory article on
                                July 4, 1780, and was confirmed by the 13th article of the treaty
                                signed at Kiel on the 14th of January, 1814; it provided that ‘the
                                aforesaid Kings, for themselves, their heirs and successors,
                                mutually do undertake and promise that they will not aid or furnish
                                the enemies of either party that shall be aggressors with any
                                provisions of war, as soldiers, arms, engines, guns, ships, or other
                                necessaries for the use of war, or suffer any to be furnished by
                                their subjects.’ It is clear that, under the provisions of this
                                stipulation, her Majesty’s government had no alternative but to
                                issue the orders to which your excellency has drawn attention.</p>
                            <p>“I have thus shown that the practice of Great Britain has not been
                                different from that which I originally stated it to be; and that, on
                                the contrary, two cases of apparent divergence, on being examined,
                                prove that the departure from the usual practice, when it existed,
                                was dictated by exceptional causes, and thus indirectly confirm the
                                accuracy of my statement that the course now adopted is founded on
                                unbroken precedent.</p>
                            <p>“In conclusion I should wish to make a few general remarks.</p>
                            <p>“Your excellency will, I think, admit that though her Majesty’s
                                government are not prepared to change the practice of the country in
                                regard to neutrality, they have been vigilant in watching and
                                checking any symptoms of violation by British subjects of existing
                                law. Some weeks before your excellency drew attention to the cases
                                of the Hypatia and Norseman the proper authorities of this country
                                had been engaged in investigating them, and the watchfulness shown
                                on those occasions has doubtless been the reason that no attempt has
                                been made to sell or dispatch vessels in contravention <pb n="187"
                                    xml:id="pg_187" facs="0221"/>of the foreign enlistment act. A
                                report which had reached her Majesty’s government that attempts were
                                being made to enlist Irishmen for military service in France was
                                acted upon with the greatest promptitude by the authorities of the
                                Home Office, even at a time when, as it appears from the note which
                                you addressed to me on the 11th instant, it did not appear to you
                                that much importance was to be attached to the rumors. I can assure
                                your excellency that no effort shall hereafter be spared to deal
                                promptly with any actual or contemplated infractions of the law.</p>
                            <p>“I am glad to find that your excellency now not only does not insist
                                upon, but disclaims, the doctrine of benevolent neutrality, which
                                appeared to her Majesty’s government, after a most careful
                                examination of your memorandum of the 30th of August, to be the
                                principal basis on which your representations were founded. That
                                such a doctrine is untenable will now be universally admitted; while
                                it must be as generally admitted that it would be a real departure
                                from neutrality for a neutral to change without general consent its
                                practice—a practice, be it observed, in conformity with the views of
                                all writers on international law, because such practice might
                                incidentally be more or less favorable to one of two
                                belligerents.</p>
                            <p>“Good offices may be benevolent, but neutrality, like arbitration,
                                cannot be so.</p>
                            <p>“It would be a serious violation of neutrality if a neutral nation
                                guided itself by any principle or rule of conduct, however just or
                                meritorious in itself, which had not been previously recognized and
                                sanctioned by the usage of nations.</p>
                            <p>“I sincerely rejoice that Prussia, who, as a neutral, has always been
                                a strenuous champion of the rights of neutrals, now, as your
                                excellency points out, shows a desire to ‘incline to every progress
                                in the field of increasing the active freedom’ of commercial
                                interests in time of war; though I cannot but observe that the
                                special point which your excellency adduces as evidence of this
                                desire is a question which may be viewed differently by independent
                                powers in proportion to their maritime strength.</p>
                            <p>“Her Majesty’s government, at the outset of a war which they
                                deplored, and after an appeal to the belligerents to act in
                                accordance with the 24th protocol of the treaty of Paris had been
                                refused by them, declared their neutrality, in the earnest desire to
                                maintain friendly relations with both. It was their wish to exercise
                                all friendly offices compatible with perfect impartiality. They
                                further expressed their determination to exercise their duties and
                                maintain their rights as neutrals. It gave me great satisfaction
                                when your excellency was good enough to inform me in conversation
                                that you knew of no other subject but the one under discussion on
                                which Germany had any foundation for complaining of the attitude of
                                this country as a neutral. It is not for the first time that I
                                inform your excellency that her Majesty’s government have no
                                jealousy of German unity. They believe it to be a great and worthy
                                object for Germany to endeavor, with the consent of all its members,
                                to consolidate its vast moral, intellectual, and physical powers. An
                                ardent desire that not only the governments but the people of Great
                                Britain and Germany should be in the most friendly relations induces
                                me to repeat my belief that so just and thoughtful a nation as yours
                                will not permanently entertain feelings of rancor against England,
                                or, I might add, the United States, for adhering as neutrals to the
                                practice which they had always adopted, and which, up to the
                                outbreak of the present war, has been the theory and practice of
                                both the belligerents.</p>

                                the following regulations shall be made known, not only at the open
                                ports, but also at all towns on the sea-coast, so as to prevent
                                untoward consequences.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> With reference to your dispatch of the
                            16th ultimo, No. 112, which presents a very lucid statement of your view
                            of the relative positions of North Germany and France in the pending
                            was, and especially to that part of your communication which relates to
                            the exemption of the North German mail steamships from capture by French
                            cruisers, I have to inform you that on the 16th ultimo the Secretary of
                            State addressed a cable dispatch on this subject to Mr. E. B. Washburne,
                            a copy of which and of his reply is inclosed. From that reply you will
                            perceive that in the exercise of its rights as a belligerent the French
                            government declines to exempt those steamships from capture except those
                            then at sea ignorant of war which may enter a French port. This decision
                            is much regretted by this government, which would be glad to avail
                            itself of any peaceable means of inducing a reversal of it.</p>
                        <p>While upon the subject of the policy as a belligerent to which France has
                            committed herself, I inclose a copy of a telegraphic dispatch of the
                            25th of July from Minister Washburne, and of a note of the same date
                            from Mr. Berthemy, the minister of France here, together with a copy of
                            a note from the latter of the 3d instant, and of my reply thereto.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> On the 13th instant this Department
                            received from Mr. Washburne a telegram relating to the proposed
                            expulsion of Germans from France, and suggesting that Prussia should
                            grant a credit to mitigate the great suffering that would inevitably
                            result.</p>
                        <p>The same day the substance of this telegram was communicated to you by
                            cable, and the text was read to Baron Gerolt. On the 14th instant the
                            Department received your reply by cable, saying that a credit had been
                            granted, and asking whether Mr. Washburne had protested. To this answer
                            was made to you, on the same day, that Mr. Washburne had already
                            protested. Before the Duke de Gramont left office he had notified Mr.
                            Washburne that this step might become necessary, and Mr. Washburne, in
                            an able paper, (of which a copy will be sent you by a future post,) had
                            protested against the measure.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Washburne was also notified by cable, on the 14th, of the granting of
                            the credit, and to-day he has, in like manner, been informed that his
                            note to the Duke de Gramont has been fully approved, and he has been
                            instructed to do all he can, consistently with our position as a neutral
                            power, to mitigate the severities of the expulsion. Copies of these
                            several telegrams are herewith inclosed.</p>

                        <p>Washburne telegraphs that France requests United States to join other
                            powers in effort for peace. Uniform policy and true interest of United
                            States not to join European powers in interference in European
                            questions. President strongly desires to see war arrested and blessings
                            of peace restored. If Germany also desires to have good offices of
                            United States interposed, President will be glad to contribute all aid
                            in his power to secure restoration of peace between the two great powers
                            now at war, and with whom United States has so many traditions of
                            friendship. Ascertain if North Germany desires such offices, but without
                            making the tender thereof unless assured they will be accepted.</p>

                            instant, has been received.</p>
                        <p>The reasons which you present against an American intervention between
                            France and Germany are substantially among the considerations which
                            determined the President in the course and policy indicated to you in
                            the cable dispatches from this office on the 9th instant, and in
                            rejecting all idea of mediation unless upon the joint request of both of
                            the warring powers.</p>
                        <p>It continues to be the hope of the President, as it is the interest of
                            the people of this country, that the unhappy war in which France and
                            North Germany are engaged should find an early end.</p>
                        <p>This Government will not express any opinion as to the terms or
                            conditions upon which a peace may or should be established between two
                            governments equally sharing its friendship, but it is hoped that the
                            prolongation of the war may not find its cause either in extreme demands
                            on the one side, or extreme sensitiveness on the other side.</p>
                        <p>So far as you can consistently and without my official interposition of
                            advice or of counsel, it is hoped that you will lose no proper
                            opportunity to indicate the wishes and hopes of the President and of the
                            American people as above represented, and to contribute what you may to
                            the presentation of such terms of peace as befit the greatness and the
                            power which North Germany has manifested, and as shall not be
                            humiliating or derogatory to the pride of the great people who were our
                            earliest and fast ally.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> The refusal of the German authorities at
                            the investment of Paris to allow the United States minister there to
                            send a messenger to London with a pouch, with dispatches from his
                            legation, unless the contents of the pouch should be unsealed, must be
                            regarded as an uncourteous proceeding. which cannot be acquiesced in by
                            this Government. Blockade by both sea and land is a military measure for
                            the reduction of an enemy’s fortress, by preventing the access of relief
                            from without, and by compelling the troops and inhabitants to surrender
                            for want of supplies. When, however, the blockaded fortress happens to
                            be the capital of the country where the diplomatic representative of a
                            neutral state resides, has the blockading force a right to cut him off
                            from all intercourse by letter with the outer world, and even with his
                            own government? No such right is either expressly recognized by public
                            law, or is even alluded to in any treatise on the subject. The right of
                            legation, however, is fully acknowledged, and, as incident to that
                            right, the privilege of sending and receiving messages. This privilege
                            is acknowledged in unqualified terms. There is no exception or
                            reservation looking to the possibility of blockade of a capital by a
                            hostile force. Although such blockades are not of frequent occurrence,
                            their liability to happen must have presented itself to the minds of the
                            writers on public law, and, if they had suppossed that the right of
                            sending messengers was merged in or subordinate to the belligerent
                            rights of the assailant, they certainly would have said so. Indeed, the
                            rights of legation under such circumstances must be regarded as
                            paramount to any belligerent right. They ought not to be questioned or
                            curtailed, unless the attacking party has good reason to believe that
                            they will be abused, or unless some military necessity, which upon
                            proper statement must be regarded as obvious, shall require the
                            curtailment.</p>
                        <p>The condition upon which the sending of messengers was offered was
                            humiliating, and could not be accepted by any diplomatic agent with any
                            self-respect. Correspondence between those officers and their
                            governments is always more or less confidential, and it is unreasonable
                            to suppose that its inspection by the blockading force should be
                            permitted. Indeed, the requirement of such a condition must be regarded
                            as tantamount <pb n="196" xml:id="pg_196" facs="0230"/>to an imputation
                            both upon the integrity of the minister and the neutrality of his
                            government.</p>
                        <p>You will consequently remonstrate against the exercise of authority
                            adverted to as being contrary to that paramount right of legation which
                            every independent nation ought to enjoy, and in which all are equally
                            interested.</p>
                        <p>Prussia has heretofore been a leading champion of the rights of neutrals
                            on the ocean. She has, even during the existing war, made acknowledged
                            sacrifices to her faith and consistency in that respect. The course of
                            her arms on land does not seem to warrant or require any enforcement of
                            extreme belligerent claims in that quarter as against neutrals.</p>
                        <p>An analogous privilege of legation was upon several occasions
                            successfully asserted by this Government, during the late war between
                            Brazil and her allies on the one side, and Paraguay on the other. Mr.
                            Washburn, the United States minister to Paraguay, applied for a permit
                            to take him through the hostile lines to Asuncion, his destination. The
                            applicaiion, though at first rejected, was ultimately granted.
                            Application was subsequently made for leave for General McMahon, his
                            successor, to pass the same lines, and for the vessel which carried him
                            to bring back Mr. Washburne. This, also, though at first refused, was
                            ultimately granted, There is reason to believe that the course taken by
                            this Government on those occasions was approved by other governments. It
                            is probable that other governments would also sanction the claim of the
                            United States in this case.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> The undersigned, Secretary of State of
                                the United States, duly received the note of the 4th instant, with
                                the accompanying documents, addressed to him by Baron Gerolt, envoy
                                extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the North German Union
                                relative to intercourse between the diplomatic representatives in
                                Paris of the governments of neutral states and their respective
                                governments. In that communication it is assumed that Paris being in
                                a state of seige by the German forces, the latter have a belligerent
                                right, under the public law, to cut off all intercourse between the
                                diplomatic representatives of foreign powers there and their
                                governments at home, or if such intercourse should be allowed at
                                all, that the besieging force may prescribe the conditions upon
                                which it shall be permitted. The right seems farther to be claimed
                                upon the alleged impropriety of diplomatic agents continuing to
                                reside in a beleaguered city which contains persons in authority
                                whose title thereto has not been recognized by the assailant.</p>
                            <p>The undersigned, after a careful consideration of the subject, and
                                with every disposition to acknowledge the just and necessary
                                belligerent rights of the blockading force, cannot acquiesce in the
                                pretension set up on behalf of that force. It is true, that when <pb
                                    n="197" xml:id="pg_197" facs="0231"/>such a force invests a
                                fortified place with a view to its reduction, one of the means
                                usually relied upon for that purpose is the interruption of ordinary
                                communication by messengers or by letters. This is acknowledged to
                                be not only a belligerent right, but also one incident to the actual
                                sovereignty over the enemy’s territory occupied by the assailant
                                adjacent to the blockaded place. Paris, however, is the capital of
                                France. There the diplomatic representatives of neutral states had
                                their official residence prior to the investment. If they think
                                proper to stay there while it lasts, they must expect to put up with
                                the inconveniences necessarily incident to their choice. Among
                                these, however, the stopping of communication with their governments
                                cannot be recognized. The right of embassy to a belligerent state is
                                one which it is both the duty and the interest of its enemies to
                                acknowledge, and to permit the exercise of, in every usual or proper
                                way. If this right should be denied or unduly curtailed, wars might
                                be indefinitely prolonged, and general peace would be
                                impracticable.</p>
                            <p>The privilege of embassy necessarily carries with it that of
                                employing messengers between the embassy and its government. This is
                                a privilege universally recognized by publicists. There is no
                                exception or reservation made for the case of an embassy having its
                                abode in a blockaded place. Indeed, the denial of the right of
                                correspondence between a diplomatic agent in such a place and his
                                government seems tantamount to insisting that he cannot elect to be
                                a neutral, but must be regarded as an adversary if he continues to
                                stay there, especially when the legitimacy of the authority of those
                                directing the resistance is denied by the other assailant.</p>
                            <p>The opposite course, which it has suited the convenience of some
                                neutral government to adopt, is obviously liable to be construed,
                                partly, at least, the occasion of withholding the privilege of
                                correspondence. Should this be a correct view of the case, no
                                independent state claiming to be a free agent in all things could in
                                self-respect acquiesce in a proceeding actuated by such a motive.
                                The undersigned does not charge the government of the North German
                                Union with being so actuated, but deems himself warranted in thus
                                referring to the point as it is adverted to by the representative of
                                that government both at Berlin and before Paris.</p>
                            <p>The undersigned is consequently directed to claim that the right of
                                correspondence between the representatives of neutral powers at
                                Paris and their governments is a right sanctioned by public law
                                which cannot justly be withheld without assigning other reasons
                                therefor than those which have hitherto been advanced. The burden of
                                a proof of the sufficiency of those reasons, in furtherance of the
                                belligerent rights of the assailant, must be borne by him.</p>
                            <p>While, however, the undersigned is directed to claim the right as due
                                to all neutrals, he will not omit to acknowledge the partial
                                exception made in favor of the minister of the United States for the
                                reasons assigned.</p>
                            <p>The undersigned avails himself of this occasion to renew to Baron
                                Gerolt the assurance of his very high consideration.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi> * * * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>War was yesterday declared against Prussia. The King did everything to
                            avoid it that he could. It is evident that there was a wavering in the
                            French cabinet, and the result is an evidence of a frivolity in the
                            decision of a momentous question that scarcely has a parallel in
                            history. At the present time nothing has occurred which furnishes any
                            excuse whatever for the resort to arms, and the solution is to be found
                            partly in the great difficulties which arise and increase in the
                            interior administration of France, and partly in the passions which have
                            rankled since 1866, and which can be no longer restrained. At that time
                            Benedetti wrote home predicting ill success to the Prussian arms; and
                            afterward, when at the peace he asked for compensation to France, the
                                <pb n="198" xml:id="pg_198" facs="0232"/>refusal which, he received
                            deeply wounded his self-love. The Emperor, too, expected the ill success
                            of the Prussians, and promised himself compensation, and was grievously
                            disappointed. Every day that war was delayed consolidated the power and
                            the union of Germany. The land was making progress in industry, wealth,
                            freedom, and patriotic feeling. France was not intrinsically, but
                            relatively, declining in political influence. It has chosen suddenly to
                            take the risk of a desperate measure. And with what prospect of success?
                            All the neutral nations of Europe have endeavored to avert the war, and
                            in more or less urgent terms have made to the French government their
                            representations against it. The French people are, by an enormous
                            majority, opposed to the war. The republican party, the Orleanists, are
                            opposed to it. The navy of France will give it the supremacy on the
                            ocean. But wars between contiguous land powers are not decided by naval
                            battles; and, in point of military preparations, the superiority within
                            four weeks will be found on the side of Germany.</p>
                        <p>Our own interests are menaced by the interruption to which the system of
                            German emigration to America will be exposed. It is to be hoped that our
                            Government may succeed in making such representations to France as will
                            permit the mail steamships, with their emigrants and with American goods
                            and property, to pursue their voyages unmolested from one country to the
                            other. On this subject I request full and particular instructions. The
                            greatest interest is felt about it.</p>
                        <p>In one respect our country will be a great gainer. The harvest of France
                            has been this year a failure, and the French will be thrown upon us very
                            largely for their supplies of bread,</p>
                        <p>The enthusiasm in Germany is high; North and South are united.
                            Frankfort-on-the-Main is as patriotic as the rest. The King of Bavaria
                            has mobilized his army. The forty millions of Germans are as one man. As
                            to courage, both nations are distinguished for it, alike officers and
                            men; but the German officer is more laborious, more persevering in his
                            attention to the wants and discipline of the soldiers of his
                            command.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, the sentiment prevails that Germany is fighting the battle of
                            public liberty and of independent nationalities. * * *</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> To-day I have to send you an authentic
                            copy of one of the most remarkable documents ever framed by a European
                            statesman. Some time ago (the exact date is uncertain) M. Benedetti, the
                            French ambassador, proposed to Count Bismarck, at a time when France was
                            in profound peace with England and with Belgium, to enter into an
                            offensive and defensive alliance for the purpose of gaining the consent
                            of France for the union of Germany on the one side, and the consent of
                            Germany to the annexation of Belgium and Luxemburg to France on the
                            other. You may rely implicitly on the authenticity of the document of
                            which I inclose a copy, for I have seen the original, in the handwriting
                            of Benedetti, which handwriting is very well known to me. As an
                            expression of contempt for the restraints of international law, the
                            document may rank with the late declaration of war by the Emperor <pb
                                n="199" xml:id="pg_199" facs="0233"/>against Prussia; but it bas,
                            moreover, the character of a defiance of Great Britain.</p>
                        <p>From the best that I can learn, the Germans, although they were taken by
                            surprise, have already a larger force on the Rhine than the French.</p>
                        <p>I have just received from an American lady at Paris five hundred thalers,
                            to be devoted to the relief of suffering German soldiers. I shall hand
                            it over to one of the many benevolent societies for wounded soldiers and
                            for the widows and orphans of those that fall in battle.</p>
                        <p>I remain, sir, yours sincerely,</p>

                                neighborhood happily existing between the two countries, and being

                                it behooves them to come to an understanding on questions which
                                concern their future relations, have resolved to conclude a treaty
                                to this effect, and named in consequence as their plenipotentiaries,

                                his Majesty the King of the Netherlands, to induce him to cede to

                                they mutually guarantee the integrity, should be menaced by
                                aggression, holding themselves bound in such a conjuncture to make
                                without delay, and not to decline on any pretext, the military
                                arrangements which may be demanded by their common interest,

                            *</p>
                        <p>The British government has undertaken in Berlin the protection of the
                            French in Germany, and to keep matters even, would have very gladly

                            refused to allow this, and by turning over the office to our Government
                            called the United States visibly into the circle of first-class powers.
                            The act of yourself and the President in accepting this protection is, I
                            will not say a new era in European politics, but a new incident, which
                            has been received with acclamation. * * *</p>

                            <p>I have previously fulfilled, by a telegraphic dispatch to Count
                                Bernstorff, on the 27th of this month, the expectation, announced by
                                Lord Granville and Mr. Gladstone in Parliament, that further
                                particulars were to be expected from both the interested parties
                                relative to the draught of a treaty by Count Benedetti.</p>
                            <p>The article published in the Times does not, by any means, contain
                                the only offer which has been made us from the French side in this
                                relation. Before the Danish war both official and unofficial French
                                agents tried to effect through me a union of France and Prussia for
                                the purpose of mutual enlargement.</p>
                            <p>It is hardly necessary for me to draw your excellency’s attention to
                                the fact that the belief of the French government in the possibility
                                of such a transaction with a German minister, whose position is
                                conditional upon his harmony with the national sentiment finds its
                                explanation only in the ignorance of French statesmen of the
                                principal conditions of the existence of other nations. If the
                                agents of the Paris cabinet had been fitted for the observation of
                                German relations they, in Paris, would not have given themselves up
                                to the illusion that Prussia could have consented to this. Your
                                excellency is, indeed, as well informed of the ignorance of the
                                French of. Germany as I am.</p>
                            <p>The exertions of the French government to carry out, with the support
                                of Prussia, its covetous designs upon Belgium and the borders of the
                                Rhine, were already made known to me before 1862, therefore before
                                my assumption of the duties of the office of foreign affairs. I
                                cannot regard it as my duty to bring such communications, which <pb
                                    n="201" xml:id="pg_201" facs="0235"/>were of a purely personal
                                nature, into the province of international law, and think that I
                                should keep hack the interesting contributions which I could make,
                                by means of private conversation and private letters, for the
                                explanation of this question.</p>
                            <p>The chosen tendencies of the French government made themselves
                                recognizable by the outward influence on European politics of the
                                position which Prance observed in our favor during the German-Danish
                                struggle. The feeling in France against us, in regard to the
                                following treaty of Gastein, agrees with the anxiety that a lasting
                                foundation of the Prussian-Austrian union might be the result of the
                                Paris cabinets sustaining its position. Already in 1865 France
                                reckoned upon the breaking out of a war between us and Austria, and
                                reapproached itself to us as soon as our relations to Vienna began
                                to become troubled.</p>
                            <p>Before the breaking out of the Austrian war of 1866 proposals were
                                made to us, partly through relatives of his Majesty the Emperor of
                                the French, partly through trusted agents, which tended at that time
                                to complete greater or less transactions for mutual enlargement;
                                sometimes it was a question of Luxemburg, or of the boundary of 1814
                                with Landau and Saar-Louis, sometimes of still greater objects, from
                                which French Switzerland and the question where the language
                                boundary of Piedmont was to be drawn were not excluded.</p>
                            <p>In May 1866 these requests assumed the form of an offer of a
                                defensive and offensive alliance, the following extract from the
                                princial points of which remained in my possession:</p>
                            <p>1. In case of a congress, to pursue amicably the cession of Venice to
                                Italy, and the annexation of the duchies to Prussia.</p>
                            <p>2. If the congress fails, alliance defensive and offensive.</p>
                            <p>3. The King of Prussia to commence hostilities ten days after the
                                separation of the congress.</p>
                            <p>4. If the congress does not reconvene Prussia shall attack within
                                thirty days alter the signature of the present treaty.</p>
                            <p>5. The Emperor of the French shall declare war against Austria as
                                soon as hostilities shall have commenced between Austria and
                                Prussia. (In thirty days, 300,000.)</p>
                            <p>6. Neither shall make separate peace with Austria.</p>
                            <p>7. Peace shall be made under the following conditions: Venice to
                                Italy; the undermentioned German territories to Prussia, (seven to
                                eight million souls at a choice;) also the federal reform in the
                                Prussian sense. For France, the territory between the Moselle and
                                Rhine, except Coblentz and Mayence. comprising 500,000 souls of
                                Prussia, Bavaria on the left bank of the Rhine. Birkenfeld. Homburg,
                                Darmstadt, 213,000 souls.</p>
                            <p>8. Military and maritime convention between France and Prussia from
                                the time of signature.</p>
                            <p>9. Adherency to the King of Italy. The strength of the army with
                                which the Emperor wished to support us was given, according to
                                Article 5, at 300,000 men in written explanations. The number of
                                souls in the addition for which France exerted herself was
                                1,800,000, according to French calculation, which does not agree
                                with reality.</p>
                            <p>Every one who is acquainted with the inner diplomatic and military
                                history of the year 1866 will perceive, through these clauses, the
                                policy which France followed at the same time with Italy, with whom
                                she also treated in secret, and later with Prussia and Italy. After
                                we had declined the above project of alliance in June 1866, in spite
                                of several almost threatening requests to accept it, the French
                                government counted still upon Austrian victory over ns and upon our
                                availing ourselves of French assistance after our final defeat, and
                                French policy now busied itself in strengthening its diplomatic
                                introduction. That the congress thought of in the foregoing project
                                of alliance, and which was later proposed once again, would have had
                                the effect to bring our union with Italy, which had been closed but
                                three months, uselessly to an end, your excellency is well aware.
                                The “patriotic anxiety” of Minister Rouher gives a commentary upon
                                the further course of events.</p>
                            <p>From that time on France has not ceased to tempt us by offers at the
                                expense of Germany and Belgium. I was never doubtful of the
                                impossibility of consenting to any offer of the kind; nevertheless I
                                held it to be of use in the interest of peace to leave the French
                                statesmen to their peculiar illusions so long as this should be
                                possible, without making any, even oral, promises. I thought that
                                the destruction of this French hope would endanger peace, which it
                                was for the interest of Germany and Europe to sustain. I did not
                                agree with those politicians who advised us not to flinch from a war
                                with France on account of our strength, because it was inevitable.
                                None can understand the foresight of God in regard to future events,
                                and I looked upon even a victorious war as in itself an evil which
                                statesmanship should take pains to spare the people. I could not
                                predict, without considering the possibility that in France changes
                                in constitution and policy might take place which would have saved
                                both these great neighboring nations from the necessity of a war; a
                                hope which acted in favor of a delay of the rupture. For this reason
                                I kept silent in respect to the requests made, and acted in a
                                dilatory manner regarding them, without making any promise on my
                                side.</p>
                            <pb n="202" xml:id="pg_202" facs="0236"/>
                            <p>After the transaction with his Majesty the King of the Netherlands
                                about the purchase of Luxemburg was broken up, in a manner which is
                                well known, the enlarged propositions of France were repeated to me,
                                which comprehended Belgium and South Germany. In this conjunction
                                falls the communication of the Benedetti manuscript. That the French
                                ambassador should have formed these proposals with his own hands,
                                should have given them to me, and gone over them with me, and, by
                                modification of position in the text, prompted by me, should have
                                acted without the assent of his sovereign, is as improbable as the
                                assertion, at another time, that the Emperor Napoleon did not agree
                                to the demand for the surrender of Mayence, which was officially
                                made to me in August 1866, by the imperial ambassador, with a threat
                                of war in case of refusal.</p>
                            <p>The different phases of French ill humor and desire for war which we
                                experienced from 1866 to 1869, coincided pretty exactly with the
                                inclination or disinclination to action of this kind which French
                                agents thought to find in me.</p>
                            <p>At the time of the preparation of the sale of the Belgian railroads,
                                in March 1868, a person in high position, who was not ignorant of
                                the earlier transactions, pointed out to me, with respect to the
                                latter, that in case of a French occupation of Belgium “we could
                                well find our Belgium somewhere else.” In the same wav, on former
                                occasions, I was given to understand that France, in the case of an
                                opening of the eastern question, could take its share, not in the
                                far east, but immediately on its border.</p>
                            <p>I have the impression that only the definite conviction that with us
                                no enlargement of the boundaries of France was to be gained, led the
                                Emperor to seek the same in spite of us. I have even reasons for
                                believing that if the publication which is now in question had not
                                taken place, that after the French and our equipments were finished
                                that the proposal would have been made us by France to carry out
                                together, at the head of a million equipped warriors, and against
                                unarmed Europe, the proposals previously made us, <hi rend="italic"
                                    >i. e.,</hi> before or after the first battle to make peace upon
                                the basis of the Benedetti proposition, at the cost of Belgium. Upon
                                the text of these proposals, I have yet to remark that the draught
                                in our hands is, from the beginning to the end, in the handwriting
                                of Count Benedetti, and is written upon the paper of the imperial
                                embassy, and that the ambassadors herein named, respectively,
                                ministers of Austria, Great Britain, Russia, Baden, Bavaria,
                                Belgium, Hesse, Italy, Saxony, Turkey, and Wurtemburg, who have seen
                                the original, have recognized the handwriting.</p>
                            <p>At the first reading Count Benedetti renounced the closing passage in
                                Article I, and immediately after I had remarked to him that the same
                                presupposed an interference of France in the internal affairs of
                                Germany, which I could not permit even in secret acts, he inclosed
                                it in parentheses. From an impulse of his own, he, in my presence,
                                made a correction of less importance on the margin in Article
                                II.</p>
                            <p>I orally informed Lord Aug. Loftus, on the 24th, of the existence of
                                the act, and upon his doubting it I invited him to view it
                                personally. On the 27th he saw it, and convinced himself that it was
                                from the hand of his former French colleague.</p>
                            <p>The aspect of the political situation is explained by the imperial
                                cabinet’s denial to-day of the designs for the accomplishment of
                                which it has exerted itself without interruption since 1864,
                                changing from threats to promises in order to win us.</p>

                        <p>Yesterday forenoon I received your telegram, as follows:</p>
                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Bancroft,</hi>

                        <p>French government decides North Germans, with certain exceptions, quit
                            France. Impossible for great numbers of poor to leave without pecuniary
                            aid. Washburne asks will Prussian government place a credit at his
                            disposition to assist poor in leaving? It seems necessary in the
                            interest of humanity. Inform him and this Department.</p>

                        <p>I immediately waited upon Mr. Director Phillipsborn, and afterward met
                            him and Mr. Secretary Von Thiele by appointment at 12 o’clock. It was
                            promptly decided to afford the poor North Germans expelled from France
                            the pecuniary aid they might need, and I forthwith telegraphed to Mr.
                            Washburne, through Mr. Jones, as follows:</p>
                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Jones,</hi>
                            <hi rend="italic">American Minister, Brussels:</hi></p>
                        <p>Telegraph to Washburne immediately, in cipher if convenient, Prussia will
                            place to your credit with Rothschild fifty thousand thalers to help very
                            poor Germans expelled from France. Give only enough to reach the
                            frontier. Take care whom you help. Persuade the French government not to
                            expel Germans.</p>
                        <p>An hour later I received a letter in due form from Mr. Thiele, of which I
                            annex a copy. I also wrote to Mr. Washburne, and of that letter I annex
                            a copy. I trust that I have fulfilled your instructions to your
                            satisfaction. * * * * * * * * * *</p>

                                government to recede from the expulsion of the Germans? It is
                                against the law of nations, of civilization; all but unheard of.</p>
                            <p>To-day this government opens for you a credit with the Rothschilds to
                                the amount of fifty thousand thalers for the assistance of Germans
                                in poverty and expelled from France. They wish you to use the sum
                                frugally, and only in cases of necessity, and only to give the means
                                of reaching the frontier. But I hope and believe you will induce the
                                French to recall the order.</p>
                            <p>Your letter of the 10th is received, and the subject has been
                                referred to headquarters. I shall answer you by letter as soon as
                                shall be possible.</p>

                            blockaded Prussian ports in the North Sea. It is to be hoped that the
                            rapid events of the war will soon put an end to the blockade.</p>

                            <p>P. S.—<hi rend="italic">September</hi> 5, 1870.—I learn that the
                                United States ship Juniata, Commander Luce, has arrived off
                                Helgoland. It is reported by telegraph that “an American corvette of
                                twelve guns started, on the 2d, from Helgoland, with a pilot for the
                                Elbe, but was turned back by the French fleet.” Whether this has
                                actually happened will be known from the report of the commander of
                                the corvette.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> * * * * * * * * All North German
                                harbors of the Baltic are declared blockaded, although no effective
                                blockade has till now been executed by the French fleet. The
                                newspapers, indeed, brought some time ago the intelligence that the
                                whole German Baltic has been blockaded since the 18th instant, but
                                neither our authorities here nor those of Pillau have published a
                                legal notification of the blockade, and they could not do so because
                                they themselves have not received such from the French vice-admiral.
                                That a mere notification of the blockade at Swinemünde resp. Lübeck
                                for the whole Baltic cannot be considered effective, when no ship is
                                stationed in the neighborhood of the different other harbors, is an
                                unquestionable matter. But it may be, upon the whole, doubted
                                whether a blockade notification at only one port is legally
                                sufficient to put a stop to all other ports.</p>
                            <p>All consuls of this place are of opinion that, under said
                                circumstances, the Baltic is not yet blockaded; but, nevertheless,
                                they cannot advise captains to leave the harbor from fear their
                                ships may be captured on the open sea.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> The American minister at Paris having been
                            accepted as the protector of Germans in France, much correspondence has
                            passed through my hands, relating, for example, to the security of the
                            North German embassy, and of North German property in Paris, and the
                            condition of those left in charge of them. The French forward their
                            letters to wounded and captive French officers through Mr. Washburne to
                            me. Parents in Germany remit money through me to their children who are
                            in want. Then there are letters asking of our minister his attention to
                            the care of Germans imprisoned, of merchants interfered with, &amp;e.,
                            &amp;c. Every letter from the government to Mr. Washburne has hitherto
                            passed through my hands. The principle that governed this interchange of
                            good offices was that the communications should relate to other matters
                            than those of war, and the result has been highly appreciated in France,
                            especially by the families of the wounded and captive French officers.
                            By the inclosed copy of a letter, you will see that Count Bismarck
                            wished to send a communication destined for the French government
                            through Mr. Washburne, and, to save time, transmitted it directly to the
                            American minister at London. The direct mails being interrupted between
                            Germany and France, my channel of communication has been the American
                            minister-resident at Brussels, but now that the mails run less certainly
                            between Brussels and Paris, correspondence may pass through the legation
                            at London. * * * * <pb n="206" xml:id="pg_206" facs="0240"/>Mr.
                            Washburne will always know how to make a proper disposition of any paper
                            or letter he may receive. In short, the Department may trust Mr.
                            Washburne and me, that we shall keep ourselves strictly within the line
                            of duty as neutral, but as a neutral that with the consent of France has
                            accepted a trust for North Germany. I am ever exceedingly anxious not to
                            go beyond what I take to be the evident meaning and intent of my
                            instructions, and Mr. Washburne is very considerate.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Bear Mr. Bancroft:</hi> You are aware that the
                                French have repeatedly disregarded not only the general law of
                                nations by firing at a flag of truce, but also the convention of
                                Geneva, to which they are a party, by attacking our ambulances and
                                surgeons. Count Bismarck has addressed a remonstrance on this
                                subject to the French government, and, in order to save time, has
                                transmitted the dispatch to Count Bernstorff, with the injunction to
                                request your colleague, Mr. Motley, to forward it to Mr. Washburne.
                                But Mr. Motley, and not without apparent reason, doubts if in his
                                position he would be justified in making himself the intermediary of
                                such a communication. Count Bismarck, therefore, desires me to ask
                                your opinion as to the best way of conducting a non-military
                                correspondence, the urgent necessity of which may any day arise
                                between us and the French government. Would you think it advisable
                                for me to telegraph to Baron Gerolt to demand an authorization for
                                Mr. Motley? Or what else would you propose? * * * * * * *</p>

                        <p>No time now for America to intervene. Germany rejects all foreign
                            interference. Every other power holds back. America would stand alone
                            and unable to accomplish anything. Our interest, dignity, require us for
                            the present to stand aloof.</p>

                        <p>I am able to report to you, on the best authority, the views which are
                            entertained by the allied German governments in relation to the
                            conditions of the peace to be established between themselves and
                            France.</p>
                        <p>The pledges for peace contained in the plebiscite so lately adopted in
                            France have not been made good.</p>
                        <p>Events have shown the mutability of the disposition of the French nation.
                            The majority of the French chamber, the senate, and the organs of public
                            opinion through the press have demanded a war of conquest against
                            Germany so loudly that the insulated friends of peace lost all courage
                            to oppose, and the Emperor may have thought himself justified in
                            asserting that he had been forced into the war by public opinion. In
                            view of these facts the German allied governments cannot find a
                            guarantee of peace in the disposition of the French people. They must
                            not therefore deceive themselves into the belief that there is no reason
                            to expect after this peace a speedy renewal of an attack, whatever may
                            be the conditions which may be demanded from France. The French nation
                            will never forgive the series of defeats which have attended their
                            present war of aggression. Even though the Germans were to demand no
                            cession of territory, no indemnity, no advantage, except the glory of
                            their arms, there would remain the wounded self-love of the French
                            people and their hereditary desire of conquest, and they would only wait
                            for a day when they might hope to renew the war with success. The
                            forbearance of the German government in 1867 was due to their desire not
                            to conjure up an era of bitterness and angry passions, but by patience
                            and the careful culture of friendly relations between the two nations to
                            lay the foundations of an era of peace and reciprocal good will. As this
                            moderation failed of its effect, and as the Germans, against all their
                            efforts, have been compelled to encounter a war of aggression, they
                            regard it henceforward as necessary to look for some securities against
                            the next attack other than can be found in the good will of France. The
                            guarantees which were established in 1815 against the same ambition of
                            the French people have lost their effect, and Germany must now rely on
                            its own strength and its own resources. The Germans ought not to be
                            continually exposed to the necessity of again <pb n="208"
                                xml:id="pg_208" facs="0242"/>making the same exertions which they
                            have done at this time, and material securities are therefore needed for
                            their own protection and for the preservation of the peace of Europe.
                            These securities are to be demanded, not from any transient government
                            of France, but from the French nation, which has shown itself ready, as
                            the history of past centuries proves, to follow any government into war,
                            and under any government to seek acquisitions of territory from Germany.
                            In order, therefore, to establish peace, securities must be obtained
                            against the next imminent attack from France, and these can be found
                            only in the change of the present defenseless boundary of South Germany,
                            so that the point from which future attack may emanate may be more
                            remote, and the fortresses with which France has hitherto threatened
                            Germany may so far be brought into the power of Germany as to constitute
                            hereafter defensive bulwarks against invasion.</p>
                        <p>The views which I have detailed to you I know to be those which are
                            entertained in the cabinets of the German princes. They also exist in
                            all but irresistible strength in the minds of the German people. I will
                            add but one remark of my own. A true guarantee for Germany against
                            future attacks from France would be the political union of Germany
                            itself; and the most earnest negotiations are new pending between North
                            Germany on the one side and South Germany, especially Würtemberg and
                            Bavaria on the other, for the accomplishment of that object; Germany,
                            being united, will have nothing to fear from France on the one side or
                            Prussia on the other.</p>

                            has existed only on paper. Herewith I inclose a translation of a report
                            which I obtained on the subject through the activity of our consular
                            agent at Königsberg. From this it appears that French vessels of war had
                            been seen off the harbor of Pillau. An answer was given corresponding to
                            the certificate. The American ship accordingly sailed for Pillau, and
                            arrived there on the 20th.</p>
                        <p>The affidavit of the American captain, of which I inclose a copy,
                            confirms the certificate of the pilot commander. The injury done to
                            American commerce by the proclamation of the pretended blockade in
                            defiance of international law has been very great. Twenty American
                            vessels destined for Pillau or a neighboring port were at the last date
                            lying at Copenhagen, to the great loss of shippers and owners.</p>

                            <p>On this 21st day of September, 1870, Captain William Filts, of
                                Portland, United States of America, appeared at this consulate and
                                declared on oath that, after having received <pb n="209"
                                    xml:id="pg_209" facs="0243"/>from Mr. Gustav Moeller, merchant
                                of this place, the information that no blockade exists in the
                                Prussian ports of the Baltic, he set [sic] the resolution to leave
                                Helsinger for Pillau, but communicating that resolution to the
                                American consul, Mr. Higat, at Copenhagen, the latter urged him not
                                to do so, stating that he would not interfere in favor of the ship
                                and her cargo if they should be captured by the French navy.</p>
                            <p>Captain William Filts started, notwithstanding that admonition, and
                                meeting in the neighborhood of Falsterbo nine French men-of-war,
                                left unmolested, and arrived safe with his cargo at Pillau yesterday

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Count Bismarck has published another
                            circular, in which he expressly defines as the conditions of peace the
                            cession to Germany of the fortresses of Strasburg and Metz. He describes
                            every attempt of the French to obtain the intervention of neutral powers
                            as only a delay in the negotiations for peace. On the part of neutrals
                            themselves, he holds it to be an act of cruelty for them to prolong the
                            war by nursing hopes of intervention which can never be fulfilled. He
                            declines a truce, unless it shall be attended with the security of the
                            adoption of the concerted conditions of peace. He justifies his demand
                            for the possession of the fortresses by the fact, that in more than
                            twenty wars against Germany the French have in every instance been the
                            aggressors. His conditions of peace he describes as moderate, because
                            they have no other object than the safe enjoyment of tranquillity in
                            time to come. As to the internal government of France, he disavows every
                            disposition to meddle with it. His words are: “It is perfectly
                            indifferent to us what government the French nation may establish for
                            itself.” But he draws a distinction between the conditions of peace
                            which Germany demands and the form of government which France may elect.
                            The latter France alone must decide. Strasburg and Metz must pass from
                            the possession of France into that of Germany, or the peace which is to
                            be negotiated, whatever the government of France may be, will prove only
                            a truce, that would last only till France could recover strength to take
                            revenge for its defeats.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the progress of the war, I am assured by the best military
                            authorities here that Strasburg can hold out but a few days longer. It
                            will probably be in the hands of the Germans before this letter reaches
                            you. On the other hand, little has been done at Metz, except to invest
                            it, and await its surrender from want of food, of which, however, as yet
                                <pb n="210" xml:id="pg_210" facs="0244"/>there appears to be no
                            deficiency. Nevertheless, the bold, unequivocal manner in which Count
                            Bismarck, supported by all the governments of Germany, publishes to the
                            world his conditions of peace, implies a settled determination to be
                            content with nothing less.</p>
                        <p>The circular of Count Bismarck defines the nature of any negotiations on
                            the part of Jules Favre. He has communicated his conditions of peace to
                            cabinets and peoples, and leaves to the French minister little more than
                            to decide whether he can accept them. He begins and ends with an
                            ultimatum which he propounds, not in secret, but aloud, so that Jules
                            Favre, and everybody else in Europe and America, may know what it
                            is.</p>
                        <p>The news of last night announced the capture of Toul, the fortress which
                            interrupted the German line of communication by railroad with Paris. It
                            now becomes possible to forward to the neighborhood of Paris the heavy
                            guns which have already been sent forward into France as if they had
                            been intended for the siege of Metz. The circulars of Count Bismarck, of
                            which I inclose copies, of which I have given you an analysis, furnish
                            solutions to every question but one—the conditions on which Germany will
                            agree to a truce. On that subject I have now special information; Count
                            Bismarck offered Jules Favre a truce on condition, first, a constituent
                            assembly should be called; and second, for the convenience of supplying
                            the German army, the Germans should hold the fortresses of Strasburg,
                            Toul, and Verdun. Jules Favre took the offer to Paris, and yesterday
                            sent a refusal, so that war continues to rage. Meantime Toul has
                            surrendered at discretion, and the city of Strasburg may be taken within
                            three days. Meantime measures are going forward for the reconstruction
                            of government in France and in Germany. For France, it is agreed on all
                            hands that it is not fit to restore the dynasty of Napoleon. In the
                            present condition of the country it is not likely that many friends of
                            the Orleans dynasty will be returned as members of the constituent
                            assembly, which is soon to come together. And therefore there is room to
                            hope that the republic will win a majority to its support; the more so,
                            as the republic will be the second choice of the legitimists, and
                            perhaps of other parties. But the republic will be seen with reluctance
                            by Great Britain; and, in truth, of the great powers the United States
                            alone will give it a hearty welcome.</p>
                        <p>In Germany negotiations are going forward for its reconstruction as a
                            united kingdom or empire, with the King of Prussia as King or Emperor of
                            Germany. Baden has for four years been ready for such a result. The
                            possession of Hesse lying already partly in North Germany, partly in
                            South, and exposed to invasion from France, it will need but a slight
                            pressure to obtain the consent of its sovereign to the change which its
                            people already desire. In Würtemberg and in Bavaria the stern and strict
                            system of Prussian discipline, both civil and military, was not loved,
                            but its results in this war have been so astounding as to convert that
                            adverse feeling into a sentiment of admiration and gratitude. The
                            opposition to a union in Würtemberg grew out of a junction between an
                            extreme democratic party, a court party, and the ultra-montanes. The war
                            has dissolved this coalition, and the national party is in the
                            ascendant. Up to this time the spirit of independence has been strongest
                            in Bavaria, from its greatness and wealth, the antiquity and imperial
                            ancestry of its royal house, its geographical position on the Danube,
                            and the attachment of its royal family and its people to the See of
                            Borne. But the people of Bavaria have for their sovereign a patriot
                            King, who loves Germany as well as Bavaria. The ultra montane party,
                            which, against his wishes, seemed likely to obtain <pb n="211"
                                xml:id="pg_211" facs="0245"/>the ascendency in the parliament of the
                            kingdom, has suffered severe blows from the decree of Papal
                            infallibility and the fall of the temporal power of the Pope. The
                            exposed situation of the Bavarian Palatinate creates a dependency on
                            others for defense. The delight in victories achieved by the coöperation
                            of Bavarian and Prussian troops has effaced the sullenness consequent in
                            the hard reverses of 1866, and Mr. Delbrück, whose standing and ability
                            are known to you, is now at Munich, on the invitation of the Bavarian
                            government, to concert the basis of a constitution that shall include
                            all Germany. A congress of the German ruling princes will then be held,
                            and it is the general belief that success will attend the
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Such a result was, before this war, not aspired to by the Prussian King.
                            He foresaw that the union of Germany must one day take place, but he
                            never believed that it would take place during his lifetime.</p>

                            <p>P. S.—The number of German troops now on French soil is about five
                                hundred thousand. Other troops are still sent forward. To-day and
                                to-morrow there will go twelve battalions of infantry, two of
                                cavalry, and three batteries. Eight pieces of the heaviest artillery
                                are on the way to Paris. The places in Alsace which are invested and
                                not yet taken are Metz, Strasburg, Schlettstaedt, Bietsch, and
                                Pfahlzburg; in the north, Paris and Mezieres. Thionville is watched
                                by a small detachment. There has been fighting in the streets of
                                Paris, with the use of guns and cannon. Who were the parties is
                                unknown. On the 19th four divisions, one more than the Germans
                                supposed, fled before the Germans, carrying the panic into the
                                city.</p>
                            <p>One of the Würtemberg ministers, Mr. Mitnacht, has joined Mr.
                                Delbrück in Bavaria, and the conferences on the general outline of a
                                union are going forward jointly.</p>
                            <p>There are one hundred and fifty-five thousand French prisoners in
                                Germany; the French loss by death and wounds is a hundred thousand,
                                and a hundred thousand are shut up in the invested fortresses. Such
                                is the end of the French army.</p>

                            <p>The Staatsanzeiger publishes two dispatches to the North German
                                representatives near several neutral governments, in which Count
                                Bismarck gives the reasons which impose upon Germany the necessity
                                of insisting upon cessions of territory as a condition of the
                                prospective conclusion of peace with France. The first is as
                                follows:</p>
                            <p rend="right"><hi rend="smallcaps">“Rheims,</hi>
                                <hi rend="italic">September</hi> 13, 1870.</p>
                            <p>“In consequence of the erroneous ideas concerning our relations with
                                France, which reach us even from friendly quarters, I am induced to
                                express myself in the following lines in relation to the views of
                                his Majesty the King, which are shared by the allied German
                                governments.</p>
                            <p>“We thought we saw in the plebiscitum and the succeeding apparently
                                satisfactory condition of things in France, a guarantee of peace,
                                and the expression of a friendly feeling on the part of the French
                                nation. Events have taught us the contrary; at least they have shown
                                us how easily this voice, among the French nation, is changed to its
                                opposite. The almost unanimous majority of the representatives of
                                the people, of the senate, and of the organs of public opinion among
                                the press, demanded a war of conquest against us so loudly and
                                emphatically that the isolated friends of peace were discouraged,
                                and the Emperor Napoleon probably told his Majesty no untruth when
                                he declared that the state of public opinion forced him to undertake
                                the war.</p>
                            <pb n="212" xml:id="pg_212" facs="0246"/>
                            <p>“In the face of this fact we must not seek our guarantees in French
                                feelings. We must not shut our eyes to the fact that, in consequence
                                of this war, we must be prepared for a speedy attack from France
                                again, and not for a permanent peace, and that quite independently
                                of any conditions which we may impose upon France. The French nation
                                will never forgive us for the defeat in itself, nor for our
                                victorious repulse of its wanton attack. If we should now withdraw
                                from France, without any acquisition of territory, without any
                                contribution, without any advantages save the glory won by our arms,
                                the same hatred, the same desire for revenge on account of wounded
                                pride and ambition, would remain among the French nation, and it
                                would only await the day when it might hope successfully to indulge
                                these feelings. It was not a doubt of the justice of our cause, nor
                                was it an apprehension that we might not be strong enough, that
                                restrained us in the year 1867 from the war which was then offered
                                us, but the fear of exciting those passions by our victories and of
                                inaugurating an era of mutual animosity and constantly renewed wars,
                                while we hoped, by a longer continuance and attentive care of the
                                peaceful relations of both nations, to gain a firm foundation for an
                                era of peace and welfare. Now, after having been forced into the war
                                which we desired to avoid, we must seek to obtain better guarantees
                                for our defense against the next attack of the French than those of
                                their good feeling.</p>
                            <p>“The guarantees which have been sought since the year 1815 against
                                the same French desires and for the peace of Europe in the holy
                                alliance and other arrangements made in the interest of Europe,
                                have, in the course of time, lost their efficacy and significance;
                                so that Germany has finally been obliged to defend herself against
                                France, depending solely upon her own strength and her own
                                resources. Such an effort as we are now making imposes such
                                sacrifices upon the German nation that we are forced to seek
                                material guarantees and the security of Germany against the future
                                attacks of France, guarantees at the same time for the peace of
                                Europe, which has nothing to fear from Germany.</p>
                            <p>“These guarantees we have to demand, not from a temporary government
                                of France, but from the French nation, which has shown that it is
                                ready to follow any government to war against us, as is indisputably
                                manifested by the series of aggressive wars carried on for centuries
                                by France against Germany.</p>
                            <p>“Our demands for peace can therefore only be designed to lay
                                obstacles in the way of the next attack of France upon the German,
                                and especially the hitherto defenseless South German frontier, by
                                removing this frontier, and with it the point of departure of French
                                attacks, further back, and by seeking to bring the fortresses with
                                which France threatens us, as defensive bulwarks, into the power of
                                Germany.</p>
                            <p>“You will express yourself in this sense, if any questions are asked
                                of you.</p>

                            <p>The second circular relates to the first circular of Mr. Jules Favre,
                                and to the mission of Mr. Thiers, considers the question with what
                                government peace would have to be made, and then returns more
                                definitely to the subject of cessions of territory, expressly
                                demanding the surrender of Strasburg and Metz. The document is as
                                follows:</p>
                            <p rend="right"><hi rend="smallcaps">“Meaux,</hi>
                                <hi rend="italic">September</hi> 16, 1870.</p>
                            <p>“You are aware of the contents of the document which Mr. Jules Favre
                                has addressed to the representatives of France abroad, in the name
                                of the present authorities in Paris, who style themselves the
                                government of the national defense.</p>
                            <p>“It has, at the same time, come to my knowledge, that Mr. Thiers has
                                undertaken a confidential mission to several foreign courts, and I
                                presume that it will be his task, on the one hand to inspire
                                confidence in the desire for peace of the present Paris government,
                                and on the other to seek the intervention of neutral powers in favor
                                of a peace designed to rob Germany of the fruits of her victory, and
                                to prevent the establishment of any basis of peace which might lay
                                obstacles in the way of the next French attack upon Germany.</p>
                            <p>“We cannot believe in the earnest intention of the present Paris
                                government to put an end to the war, so long as it continues to
                                excite the passions of the people by its language and its acts, to
                                increase the hatred and the bitter feeling of the population,
                                already excited by the sufferings caused by the war, and to condemn
                                in advance as inadmissible for France, every basis of peace which
                                can be accepted by Germany. It thereby renders peace impossible, for
                                which it should prepare the people by mild language, duly
                                considering the serious nature of the situation, if it would lead us
                                to believe that it aims at honest negotiations for peace with us. It
                                could only be seriously supposed that we would now conclude an
                                armistice without every security for our conditions of peace, if we
                                were thought to lack military and political sagacity, and to be
                                indifferent to the interests of Germany.</p>
                            <p>“Another thing which prevents the French from clearly comprehending
                                the necessity of peace with Germany, is the hope, which is
                                encouraged by the present authorities, of a diplomatic or material
                                intervention of neutral powers in favor of France. If the French
                                nation becomes convinced, that, as it alone voluntarily inaugurated
                                the <pb n="213" xml:id="pg_213" facs="0247"/>war, and as Germany has
                                been obliged to carry on the contest alone, it will be compelled to
                                settle the account with Germany alone, it will soon put an end to
                                its now certainly useless resistance. It is cruelty on the part of
                                neutral nations towards France if they permit the Paris government
                                to encourage unrealizable hopes of intervention among the people and
                                thereby to prolong the struggle.</p>
                            <p>“We are far from any desire to interfere in the internal affairs of
                                France. It is a matter of indifference to us what sort of a
                                government the French may choose for itself. The government of the
                                Emperor Napoleon is the only one which has been formally recognized
                                by us. Our terms of peace, with whatever government, authorized for
                                the purpose, we may have to negotiate them, are entirely independent
                                of the question, how and by whom the French nation is governed; they
                                are dictated to us by the nature of the case, and by the law of
                                self-defense against a turbulent and quarrelsome people on our
                                frontier. The unanimous voice of the German governments and of the
                                German people demands that Germany be protected by better boundaries
                                than heretofore against the threats and outrages which have been
                                committed against us for centuries by all French governments. As
                                long as France remains in possession of Strasburg and Metz her
                                offensive is strategically stronger than our defensive, throughout
                                the entire south and that portion of the north of Germany which lies
                                on the left bank of the Rhine. Strasburg is, in the possession of
                                France, a constantly open sally-port against South Germany. In the
                                possession of Germany, on the other hand, Strasburg and Metz acquire
                                a defensive character. In more than twenty wars we have never been
                                the aggressor against France, and we desire nothing from that
                                country but our own safety, which has been so often jeopardized by
                                it. France, on the contrary, will regard any peace which may now be
                                concluded simply as a suspension of hostilities, and will again
                                assail us, in order to be revenged for her present defeat, with just
                                as little reason as she has done this year, as soon as she feels
                                strong enough to do so, either through her own strength or through
                                foreign alliances.</p>
                            <p>“In rendering it difficult for France (which has been the originator
                                of every disturbance of the peace of Europe hitherto) to act on the
                                offensive, we are acting, at the same time, in the interest of
                                Europe, which is that of peace. No disturbance of the peace of
                                Europe is to be feared from Germany. Since the war has been forced
                                upon us, which we have shunned for four years with the utmost care
                                and at a sacrifice of our national feeling, which has been
                                incessantly hectored by France, we will demand security in future as
                                the price of the gigantic efforts which we have been obliged to make
                                in our defense. No one will be able to reproach us for want of
                                moderation if we adhere to this just and reasonable demand.</p>
                            <p>“I desire you carefully to take cognizance of these ideas and present
                                them for consideration in your interviews.</p>

                            <p>The envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the United
                                States of America was pleased in his communication of the 15th
                                instant to draw attention to the fact that there is in Paris a large
                                amount of American property. To this notification was added the
                                suggestion that measures might be taken for the protection of this
                                property during the occupation of the French capital by German
                                troops. The undersigned <pb n="214" xml:id="pg_214" facs="0248"/>may
                                be permitted to mention in reply hereto that German troops respect
                                always private property so far as the necessities of war at all
                                admit. Even under the difficult circumstances which may perhaps
                                occur in Paris, all that is possible will willingly be done by the
                                authorities of this government to guard from injury American
                                property.</p>

                        <p>Bismarck offered Favre truce conditions. Convention to be called. Germany
                            to hold Strashurg, Verdun, Toul. Yesterday Favre rejected offer.</p>
                        <p rend="right">BANCROFT.</p>
                        <p>The account conveyed in the telegram is authentic. In the opinion of
                            Europe the terms offered were moderate. The statement that the Germans
                            demanded Mont Valerien is a misrepresentation. Now, the fall of Toul has
                            been followed by the momentous event of the surrender of Strasburg, just
                            one hundred and eighty-nine years after the day in which it was seized
                            by Louis XIV. Seventy thousand troops are thus set free to invade
                            southwestern France, the left wing to touch Lyons.</p>
                        <p>It seems very hard to understand the hopes and expectations of the
                            present French government. The constituent convention has been
                            postponed, and most men think, had a convention been held at this time
                            it would not have confirmed the revolutionary ministers in power. The
                            Orleanists see with pleasure the postponement of the convention, for
                            they have as yet had no opportunity to organize their party in the
                            nation, and under existing circumstances could be represented only by a
                            small minority. Indeed, France is distracted, by parties, and as yet
                            manifests no unity of aspiration or action in the reconstruction of its
                            civil government. * * * * * * *</p>

                            <p>P. S.—It is now said that the present government, feeling the want of
                                the confirmation of the people and the chance of ending anarchical
                                tendencies through a convention, has decided to hold elections for a
                                convention on the 16th of the next month. The Orleanists, during
                                their eighteen years’ reign, were opposed to the extension of
                                suffrage, which was confined to about 18,000 voters in all
                                France.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Guizot even invented a term to distinguish the governing class of
                                France, calling it the “pays legal.” As a consequence, the Orleans
                                dynasty was supported only by surface roots, and not having any hold
                                on the people was overthrown by the first storm. It has now no
                                popularity, but a large part of the industrial class and a large
                                part of the cultivated class in France are in favor of restoring
                                that family.</p>

                            you express your hope that the Government and people of the United

                            will be the recognition of this principle.</p>
                        <p>The treaty relating to consulships and inheritances, which I am to close
                            as soon as the incidents of war will admit, may contain references to
                            the former treaties of the United States with Prussia, confirming them
                            in part. Will you authorize me to propose on your part a recognition in
                            the pending treaty of the principle which you affirm in the letter I

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Several causes have combined to delay
                            operations against Paris far beyond the time that was at first assigned
                            for them. The King is disinclined to damage the city. The officers of
                            the army have been relying for success on the deficiency of food among
                            the besieged; the heavy cost that transport from the termination of the
                            railways have cut up the roads and made them almost bottomless; two
                            hundred wagons have been used where two thousand are needed, and the
                            construction of the batteries and collection of material have proceeded
                            somewhat languidly. Meantime the besieged have used military skill and
                            their great numbers to complete their defenses. The men have been
                            organized and trained to the offices of war, and their courage and <pb
                                n="216" xml:id="pg_216" facs="0250"/>temper have hardened, so that
                            the attack on Paris is now attended with increased difficulty, except
                            only that the food within the walls is constantly growing less. I am
                            told by good authority that the bombardment, if it takes place at all,
                            cannot begin before the 20th, and probably not so soon as that. In
                            short, it is evident that the Germans wish to avoid a bombardment if
                            possible, although they are preparing for it as tor an eventual
                            necessity. Mr. Thiers went on his mission to Count Bismarck without any
                            plenipotentiary authority whatever. He was very much in earnest, and one
                            of his interviews with the chancellor lasted seventeen hours
                            uninterruptedly. After this he returned to Paris for powers, which were
                            refused him. Jules Favre and Gambetta professed to have been in favor of
                            a truce; Trochu, whose opinion prevailed, was most decidedly against it.
                            The Germans are of opinion that Paris, under any circumstances, must
                            fall. The French are of opinion that unless Trochu can make vigorous and
                            successful sallies it must fall. Another month will hardly go by without
                            manifestly approaching a solution of the question so far as Paris is
                            concerned; but as yet I see nothing that promises a speedy establishment
                            of peace.</p>
                        <p>The negotiations for receiving the southern states into the North German
                            Union, which will then become the German Union, continue, it seems
                            probable that at the approaching session of the Reichstag Baden,
                            Würtemberg, and perhaps Hesse, will be at once received. Bavaria may
                            hold out a little longer, but public opinion decided not to sacrifice
                            the efficiency of the consolidated union to the scruples of a wayward
                            recusant, and Bavaria may for a time, but not for a very long time,
                            occupy the position of North Carolina after the organization of our
                            Government in 1789.</p>

                            exception of No. 237, which appears to have been lost on the way.</p>

                            receipt of your letter of the 19th instant, communicating to this
                            Government the text of a dispatch from Count Bismarck, to the effect
                            that private property on the high seas will be exempt from seizure by
                            the ships of his Majesty the King of Prussia, without regard to
                            reciprocity.</p>
                        <p>In compliance with the request further contained in your note, that
                            communication has been officially made public from this Department.</p>
                        <p>It is now nearly a century since the United States, through Thomas
                            Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, and John Adams, their plenipotentiaries,
                            and Prussia, under the guidance of the great Frederick, entered into a
                            treaty of amity and commerce, to be in force for ten years from its
                            date, whereby it was agreed that if war should unhappily arise between
                            the two contracting parties, “all merchant and trading vessels employed
                            in exchanging the products of different places, and thereby rendering
                            the necessaries, conveniences, and comforts of human life more easy to
                            be obtained, and more general, should be allowed to pass free and
                            unmolested; and that neither of the contracting powers should grant or
                            issue any commission to any private armed vessels, empowering them to
                            take or destroy such trading vessels, or interrupt such commerce.”</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States receives with great pleasure the
                            renewed adherence of a great and enlightened German government to the
                            principle temporarily established by the treaty of 1785, and since then
                            advocated by this Government whenever opportunity has offered. In 1854,
                            President Pierce, in his annual message to Congress, said: “Should the
                            leading powers of Europe concur in proposing, as a rule of international
                            law, to exempt private property upon the ocean from seizure by public
                            armed cruisers, as well as by privateers, the United States will readily
                            meet them on that broad ground.” In 1856, this Government was invited to
                            give its adhesion to the declaration of Paris. Mr. Marcy, the then
                            Secretary of State, replied: “The President proposes to add to the first
                            proposition in the declaration of the Congress at Paris the following
                            words: ‘And that the private property of the subjects or citizens of a
                            belligerent on the high seas shall be exempted from seizure by public
                            armed vessels of the other belligerent, unless it be contraband. Thus
                            amended, the Government of the United States will adopt it, together
                            with the other three principles contained in that <pb n="218"
                                xml:id="pg_218" facs="0252"/>declaration.’” And again, in 1861, Mr.
                            Seward renewed the offer to give the adhesion of the United States to
                            the declaration of the congress of Paris, and expressed a preference
                            that the same amendment should be retained.</p>
                        <p>Count Bismarck’s dispatch, communicated in your letter of the 19th
                            instant, shows that North Germany is willing to recognize this principle
                            (even without reciprocity) in the war which has now unhappily broken out
                            between that country and France. This gives reason to hope that the
                            Government and the people of the United States may soon be gratified by
                            seeing it universally recognized as another restraining and harmonizing
                            influence imposed by modern civilization upon the art of war.</p>
                        <p>Accept, sir, the renewed assurance of my very high consideration,</p>

                            <p>Count Benedetti at Ems, on the 19th instant, asked an audience from
                                the King, which was granted to him at once. At this interview he
                                demanded that the King should give orders to the Prince of
                                Hohenzollern to withdraw his acceptance of the Spanish crown. The
                                King replied that as he had been addressed on this whole affair only
                                as head of the family, and never as King of Prussia, and hence had
                                given no order for the acceptance of the crown candidacy, he just as
                                little could command the withdrawal of the same. On the 11th the
                                French ambassador requested and was granted a second audience, in
                                which he endeavored to exert a pressure upon the King, to the end
                                that he urge the prince to renounce the crown. The King replied that
                                the prince was perfectly at liberty as regarded his determination;
                                moreover, he himself did not know where the prince, who intended to
                                make a tour to the Alps, was at the present time. On the promenade
                                at the springs, in the morning of the 13th, the King handed to the
                                ambassador an extra sheet of the Cologne Gazette, which had just
                                reached him, with a private telegram from Sigmaringen, relative to
                                the renunciation of the prince, remarking at the same time, that he
                                himself had not received as yet a letter from Sigmaringen, but might
                                expect one this day. Count Benedetti observed that he had received
                                the news of the renunciation already yesterday evening from Paris;
                                and as the King by this considered the matter as settled, the
                                ambassador now demanded, quite unexpectedly, from the King, that he
                                should give definite assurance that he would never again give his
                                assent, in case the said crown candidacy should be revived. The King
                                definitely declined such a demand and adhered to this avowal, when
                                Count Benedetti returned repeatedly and more urgently to his
                                proposition. Nevertheless, Count Benedetti, after a few hours,
                                demanded a third audience. Upon inquiry what subject was to be
                                discussed, he replied that he wanted to renew the subject of that
                                morning. The King for this reason declined a new audience, as he had
                                no answer than the previous one to make, and besides, from this time
                                all transactions were to be made through the departments. The King
                                complied with the wish of Count Benedetti to take leave of him, and
                                on the morning of the 14th granted him at the depot on his way to
                                Coblenz. It is shown, then, that the ambassador had three interviews
                                with the King, which bore the character of private conversations, as
                                Count Benedetti never acted as negotiator or commissioner.</p>

                            <p>His Majesty the King, in consequence of a conversation had with Count
                                Benedetti on the morning of the 13th of July, on the promenade of
                                the springs, graciously sent me about 2 o’clock in the afternoon to
                                the count with the following commission:</p>
                            <p>That his Majesty an hour ago had received in writing from the Prince
                                of Hohenzollern, at Sigmaringen, the full confirmation of what the
                                count had this morning communicated to him, as heard directly from
                                Paris, relative to the renunciation of Prince Leopold to the Spanish
                                crown candidacy. That hence his Majesty considered this affair
                                settled.</p>
                            <p>Having delivered myself of my commission to Count Benedetti, he said
                                that since his conversation with the King he had received a new
                                dispatch of Monsieur de Gramont, in which he was charged to request
                                an audience from his Majesty and again to lay before his Majesty the
                                request of the French government, viz.:</p>
                            <p>1. To approve the renunciation of the Prince of Hohenzollern.</p>
                            <p>2. To give assurance that this candidacy should not be resumed in the
                                future.</p>
                            <p>Whereupon his Majesty replied to the count, through me, that he
                                approved of the renunciation of Prince Leopold in the same sense and
                                to the same extent in which his Majesty had done this before, in
                                regard to the acceptance of this candidacy. That his Majesty had
                                received the written renunciation from Prince Anton of Hohenzollern,
                                who had been authorized thereto by Prince Leopold. In regard to the
                                second point, the assurance for the future, his Majesty could but
                                refer to his own reply given to the count this morning; Count
                                Benedetti received this reply of his Majesty thankfully, and said he
                                would report the same to his government.</p>
                            <p>As regarded the second point, however, he should maintain his request
                                for another interview with his Majesty, because he was expressly
                                ordered to do so by the last dispatch of Monsieur de Gramont, and if
                                it was only in order to hear the same words again from his Majesty,
                                the more so as this last dispatch contained new arguments which he
                                had to lay before his Majesty. Whereupon his Majesty replied,
                                through me, to Count Benedetti for the third time, at about half
                                past five o’clock, after dinner, that his Majesty must decline
                                definitively relative to this last point (obligatory assurance for
                                the future) to enter into further discussions. What he had said this
                                morning was his last word in this matter, and he could do nothing
                                but refer to it.</p>
                            <p>When assured that Count Bismarck’s arrival at Ems could not be relied
                                on, even for the next day, with certainty, Count Benedetti declared
                                himself satisfied on his part with this declaration of his Majesty
                                the King.</p>

                                [Of July 19, 1870.]</head>
                            <p>The French imperial government has caused its chargé d’affaires to
                                present the annexed document containing its declaration of war. This
                                is the first and only official communication which we have received
                                from the French imperial government in this whole affair which has
                                occupied the attention of the world for the last fourteen days.</p>
                            <p>As motives of the war in which the imperial government involves us,
                                it adduces the following:</p>
                            <p>The refusal of his Majesty the King to give assurance that the
                                elevation of a Prussian prince upon the Spanish throne should not be
                                realized with his assent, and the alleged notification to the
                                cabinets of the refusal to receive the French ambassador, and to
                                transact further business with him.</p>
                            <p>We have briefly to reply as follows:</p>
                            <p>His Majesty the King, fully respecting the independence of the
                                Spanish nation, and the freedom of the princes of the house of
                                Hohenzollern to form their own resolutions, has never entertained
                                the idea to elevate the hereditary prince upon the Spanish throne.
                                The demands imposed upon his Majesty to give assurances for the
                                future were uncalled for and arrogant. It is an arbitrary invention
                                to ascribe to him a mental reservation or a hostile intention
                                against France.</p>
                            <p>The alleged notification to the cabinets has never taken place,
                                neither has a refusal to transact business with the ambassador of
                                the Emperor of the French. On the contrary, the ambassador has never
                                endeavored to transact official business with the royal government,
                                but has discussed the questions only personally and privately at Ems
                                with his Majesty the King.</p>
                            <p>It is apparent to the German nation, inside and outside of the North
                                German Union, that the demands of the French government were
                                intended as a humiliation which the nation will not bear, and that
                                the war, never intended by Prussia, is forced upon us by France.</p>
                            <pb n="221" xml:id="pg_221" facs="0255"/>
                            <p>The whole civilized world will perceive that the causes which France
                                adduces do not exist, but are pretexts invented.</p>
                            <p>The North German Union, and its confederate governments of South
                                Germany, protest against the unprovoked surprise of the German
                                Union, and shall ward off the same with all the means which God has
                                granted them.</p>

                            <p>After the news of the renunciation of the hereditary Prince of
                                Hohenzollern had been officially communicated to the French imperial
                                government by the royal Spanish government, the French ambassador at
                                Ems demanded from his Majesty the King authorization to telegraph to
                                Paris that his Majesty the King would bind himself for all future
                                time not to give his assent in case the Hohenzollern should return
                                to their candidacy. His Majesty the King thereupon declined again to
                                receive the French ambassador, and replied to him, through his
                                aide-de-camp, that he had no further communication to make to
                                him.</p>

                            <p>The undersigned, charge d’affaires of France, in carrying out the
                                orders which he has received from his government, has the honor to
                                bring to the notice of his excellency the minister of foreign
                                affairs of his Majesty the King of Prussia the following
                                communication:</p>
                            <p>The government of his Majesty the Emperor of France cannot regard the
                                project to elevate a Prussian prince upon the Spanish throne
                                otherwise than as an enterprise directed against the territorial
                                security of France, and found itself under the necessity to ask from
                                his Majesty the King of Prussia the assurance that such an event
                                would not transpire with his assent. His Majesty the King of Prussia
                                having refused to give this assurance, but, on the contrary, having
                                informed the ambassador of his Majesty the French Emperor that he
                                intended to reserve on this occasion, as on all others, freedom to
                                consult the circumstances, the imperial government cannot but see in
                                this declaration of the King a mental reservation, threatening to
                                France as well as to the general balance of power in Europe. This
                                declaration was aggravated still more by the notification made to
                                the cabinets, of the refusal to receive the ambassador of the
                                Emperor and to enter upon any new explanation with him.</p>
                            <p>Consequently the government of his Imperial Majesty feels itself
                                under the necessity immediately to see to the defense of its, honor
                                and of its interests, and, having resolved for this purpose to take
                                all measures necessary under the situation forced upon it, considers
                                itself from this moment in a state of war with Prussia.</p>
                            <p>The undersigned has the honor to offer to his excellency, &amp;c.,
                                &amp;c., &amp;c., the assurance of his high consideration.</p>

                                of Lords of the 28th ultimo,) in relation to the draught of a treaty
                                published in the Times of the 25th, has led Count Benedetti to give
                                an account of the origin of said draught, in the Journal Officiel de

                            <p>I have not made use of this sooner because I did not wish, even in a
                                state of war, to bring the person of the monarch into a discussion
                                of official acts of his representatives and ministers, and because,
                                during the existence of the system of government which, as is
                                understood, existed in France previously to the 2d of January of the
                                present year, I could not be prepared for the assertion that an act
                                like the submitting of that draught of a treaty to me, and the other
                                propositions mentioned in my dispatch of the 29th, had taken place
                                without the previous knowledge of the Emperor Napoleon. The
                                assurance of the French minister of foreign affairs that the Emperor
                                Napoleon never proposed to Prussia a treaty to take possession of
                                Belgium, and the statements of Count Benedetti that the proposition
                                for the treaty came from me; that he, in order to obtain a clear
                                idea of my combinations, consented to put them on paper in a manner
                                under my dictation, and that the Emperor Napoleon did not receive
                                information of this draught of a treaty until afterward; these
                                assertions force me to make use of a means which is at my command in
                                order still further to confirm my supposition concerning the
                                business relations between the Emperor and his ministers, envoys,
                                and agents, and my statement of the French policy. Among the papers
                                of the Foreign Office is found the note (a copy of which is annexed)
                                from Count Benedetti to me, dated August 5, 1866, (A, 4,867,) and a
                                draught of a treaty sent with the same, (Ad. A, 4,867.) The
                                originals, from the hand of Count Benedetti, I submit to the
                                inspection of the representatives of neutral powers. I shall have
                                the honor to send a photographic fac-simile of the same to your. I
                                would remind you of the fact that, according to the statement of the
                                Moniteur, the Emperor spent the days from July 28 to August 7, 1866,
                                in Vichy. In the official interview which I had with Count Benedetti
                                in consequence of his communication, he backed the demands therein
                                contained by a threat of war in case of refusal. The refusal which I
                                nevertheless expressed was followed by a demand for Luxemburg, and
                                the failure to gain this was followed by the greater proposition,
                                embracing Belgium, which is given in Count Benedetti’s draught of a
                                treaty, published by the Times.</p>

                                limited extent of his territory, but it may well merit confidence by
                                reason of its moral and religious character. May God grant my

                                but profoundly moved, on reading the touching words written by your
                                hand in order to cause the voice of the God of peace to be heard.
                                How could my heart avoid listening to so powerful an appeal? God is
                                my witness that neither I nor my people have desired or provoked
                                war. Obeying the sacred duties which God imposes on sovereigns and
                                nations, we take up the sword in order to defend the honor and the
                                independence of our country; and we shall be ready to lay it down as
                                soon as these blessings can be secured. If your Holiness could offer
                                me, on behalf of him who has so unexpectedly declared war, the
                                assurance of sincerely pacific inclinations and guarantees against
                                the repetition of such disturbance of the peace and tranquillity of
                                Europe, I should certainly not refuse to receive them from the

                            <p>By my telegrams of the 22d and 26th of last month your excellency was
                                requested to protest to the government to which you are accredited
                                against the Violation of international law of which the French
                                troops have been guilty, by attacking the bearers of our flags of
                                truce. The constantly increasing remoteness of the theatre of war
                                from Berlin, the slowness of communication, and the necessity under
                                which the various divisions of troops are of limiting intercourse
                                with headquarters only to the most urgent cases, these circumstances
                                have hitherto rendered it impossible for me to procure with
                                satisfactory completeness official information with regard to the
                                occurrences in question. I shall, however, delay no longer to
                                communicate to your excellency what has thus far been proved
                                concerning these occurrences.</p>
                            <p>On the morning of the 19th of August Lieutenant Colonel von Verdi,
                                and Captain von Winterfeld, both staff officers of his Majesty the
                                King, were sent to Metz as bearers of flags of truce. Letters were
                                to be delivered there from French physicians in high positions, who
                                had remained on the field of battle, and arrangements were to be
                                made to alleviate the sufferings of the wounded French soldiers, by
                                procuring medical aid from that town.</p>
                            <p>As soon as aforesaid staff officers had passed our outposts, they
                                rode, on a walk, a dragoon going before them waving a white flag,
                                and likewise a trumpeter, who blew signals at short intervals.</p>
                            <p>A patrol of the enemy’s hussars very soon approached from the left,
                                and, moving along at some distance from our flag-bearers, kept
                                watching them. When they (the hussars) were about one hundred paces
                                distant they fired. The lieutenant colonel (Ton Verdi) at once
                                ordered a halt and ordered the white flag to be waved and signals to
                                be sounded. The patrol then galloped away in the direction of
                                Metz.</p>
                            <p>The flag-bearers again rode forward, on a walk, and strictly
                                observing the formalities above indicated. A French infantry post on
                                a farm near Longeau, on the road to Metz, had doubtless been
                                informed of their appearance by the aforesaid cavalry patrol. This
                                post, from which the approach of the Prussians could be seen for a
                                long time before their arrival, could not have been in any doubt
                                concerning the peaceable intentions of the slowly-advancing riders.
                                On this side this post was only seen at a distance of eighty
                                paces.</p>
                            <p>Lieutenant Colonel von Verdi at once ordered a halt, and ordered the
                                proper signal to be sounded and the flag to be waved. The French
                                answered these peaceable signs by several shots. When at length a
                                division rushed out and commenced firing, the order was given to
                                retreat. The Prussian trumpeter, Berlin first squadron, eleventh
                                dragoon regiment, was wounded and fell from his horse, but finally
                                escaped in safety from the fire of the enemy. In this manner it was
                                rendered impossible to fulfill the mission, which was intended to
                                benefit the wounded French soldiers.</p>
                            <p>The circumstances of this case are such that the plea of a
                                misunderstanding cannot be raised, and only the presumption remains
                                that the French military men in question <pb n="227" xml:id="pg_227"
                                    facs="0261"/>either intentionally violated the usages which
                                exist among all civilized nations, and which now form a part of
                                international law, or that they were entirely unacquainted with said
                                usages. The first case would indicate a strange want of discipline,
                                the second a singular neglect of duty on the part of the government.
                                In either case, however, there is good reason to protest to all
                                governments which recognize international law against so flagrant a
                                violation of the same.</p>
                            <p>I reserve to myself the preparation of a detailed account of the
                                cases mentioned in my telegram of the 26th ultimo, and most
                                respectfully request your excellency to be pleased to transmit a
                                copy of this dispatch to his excellency the minister of foreign

                            treaties, are categorically contradicted, and in which also the manner
                            is shown in which the Geneva convention has been observed by the French

                            <p>In the session of the Corps Législatif of September 1, the then
                                minister of foreign affairs, the Prince de la Tour d’Auvergne, read
                                two circulars in which the German troops were accused of various
                                violations of the law of nations in general as well as of that
                                portion of it which is regulated by treaty. German troops are
                                therein stated to have committed acts of hostility against French
                                ambulances to have taken Baron de Bussiére prisoner in the midst of
                                an ambulance corps organized by him, to have used explosive bullets,
                                to have compelled peasants living in the vicinity of Strasburg to
                                work in the trenches were they were exposed to the fire of the
                                fortress, to have sought to cover trains conveying provisions and
                                munitions of war, and also wagons containing money, with the
                                distinctive sign provided for in the Geneva convention; finally, it
                                is asserted that a French surgeon was killed by a Prussian soldier,
                                while dressing the latter’s wounds. Although I was perfectly well
                                convinced <hi rend="italic">a pilori</hi> of the incorrectness of
                                all these statements, I was not willing, in consideration of the
                                name whose sanction they bore, to confine myself to assurances that
                                such occurrences were impossible, but caused inquiry to be made
                                whether anything had happened which could have been distorted by
                                unreliable or malicious reporters to monstrous deeds of the kind
                                mentioned. These inquiries were, it is true, attended with all the
                                more difficulty <pb n="228" xml:id="pg_228" facs="0262"/>in view of
                                the fact that the statements of the French minister are made in an
                                unusually vague manner, for official declarations of so serious a
                                nature, both in regard to particulars and to the mention of the
                                authority on which they are made. Satisfactory statements of names,
                                time, and manner are everywhere wanting. Notoriety is in most eases
                                appealed to as proof, which is equivalent to a reference of the
                                French journals, whose veracity I certainly do not need to
                                characterize. In both cases, where reference is made to witnesses or
                                testimony, with regard to explosive bullets or the compulsory
                                employment of Alsatian peasants in the trenches, neither the purport
                                of the testimony nor the names of the witnesses or informants are
                                given. The inquiries which I have caused to be made have only shown
                                a foundation for one of the accusations made against the German
                                troops, and in this accusation the facts are shown to have been
                                greatly distorted. It is true that the Baron de Bussiére was
                                arrested, and that he had something to do with the care of the
                                wounded; the arrest, however, did not take place in the midst of an
                                ambulance corps; it was caused by the suspicion that said baron was
                                in secret communication with the garrison of Strasburg, and it took
                                place with all the respect due to his position and his honorable
                                reputation, as did likewise his removal to his place of detention,
                                which soon after followed. With regard to the duration of the
                                detention, military considerations alone could decide. All the other
                                statements of the two circulars I must characterize as entirely
                                fictitious, and it remains to be seen whether the French government
                                will endeavor to fulfill the obligation which rests upon it of
                                proving the assertions in question, in a manner, which after the
                                numerous evidences which we have had of the credibility of French
                                official assurances, can have any claim to respect. Out of regard to
                                the other powers who were parties to the Geneva convention, and the
                                Petersburg declaration of November 24, (December 11,) 1868, I add
                                the positive assurance that that convention has been observed in the
                                most careful manner by the German troops, and that explosive balls
                                for portable arms, or of less than 400 grams weight, are not to be
                                found in the entire German army.</p>
                            <p>On the other hand, abundantly authenticated facts of the most
                                astonishing character exist to show how the French government has
                                fulfilled, or rather not fulfilled the Geneva agreement, for the
                                conclusion of which it exerted itself, as the Prince de la Tour
                                d’Auvergne correctly says, with extraordinary zeal: The German
                                surgeons who had to attend to wounded French soldiers after the
                                battle of Wissembourg, in the hospitals under the charge of Surgeons
                                General Bägor and Wilms, became convinced that said soldiers, with
                                few exceptions, were entirely unaware of the meaning of the white
                                band with the red cross. The French military surgeons in high
                                position, who soon after visited the same hospitals for the purpose
                                of looking after their countrymen, were forced to make the
                                protective badge as best they could from the first material that
                                they could find, and positively assured Prince Putbus, delegate of
                                the Knights of St. John, that the French ministry of war had neither
                                furnished the Geneva band to the surgeons nor directed them to wear
                                it. Captured French officers have since unanimously asserted that
                                the Geneva convention and the precepts of the same, with regard to
                                the treatment of ambulances, surgeons, and wounded men, are entirely
                                unknown in the French army. And how desirable would peculiarly
                                careful instructions be for this very army, since the French
                                government has found it compatible with the humanity which the
                                circular of the 30th of August mentions, as the reason of its zeal
                                for the observance of the Geneva convention, to bring the Turcos
                                unto the field against us, men enlisted from the offscourings of the
                                population of the cities of North Africa.</p>
                            <p>I intend to show by official documents what have been the
                                consequences of the failure to issue such instructions.</p>
                            <p>In the two circulars of August 30, nothing can therefore be seen,
                                save an attempt momentarily to blunt, by counter-accusations taken
                                from the newspapers, the edge of our protest of August 26, made on
                                account of flagrant violation of the privileges of the flag of
                                truce, and of the further protest which there was good reason to
                                expect.</p>
                            <p>I most respectfully request your excellency to be pleased to furnish
                                the minister of foreign affairs with a copy or translation of this
                                dispatch.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The report made by Mr. Jules Favre to
                                his colleagues of his conversation with me on the 21st instant,
                                induces me to send your excellency a communication in reference to
                                the negotiations which took place between us, which will enable you
                                to form a correct idea of the same. It cannot be denied that Mr. J.
                                Favre has taken pains to give a generally true statement of the
                                matter. If he has not everywhere succeeded in doing so, this is
                                probably due to the length of our interviews and the circumstances
                                under which they took place. I must, however, point to the fact, in
                                opposition to the general purport of his statement, that the
                                question of the conclusion of peace did not occupy the foreground in
                                our conversation, but that of a truce, which was to precede the
                                conclusion of a peace. With regard to our demands for the subsequent
                                conclusion of a peace I expressly stated to Mr. J. Favre that I
                                would not express myself in relation to the boundary claimed by us
                                until the general principle of the cession of territory should be
                                recognized by France. In connection with this the formation of a new
                                department of the Moselle was mentioned by me, as an organization
                                according with our views, with the arrondissements of Saarburg,
                                Château Salins, Saargemund, Metz, and Thionville. In no wise,
                                however, did I state that no further conditions would be demanded by
                                us, should such seem to be necessary in consequence of the
                                sacrifices imposed upon us by the continuation of the war.</p>
                            <p>Strasburg, which Mr. Favre makes me describe as the key of <hi
                                    rend="italic">the</hi> house, thus leaving it uncertain whether
                                France is thereby meant, was expressly designated by me as the key
                                of <hi rend="italic">our</hi> house, the possession of which we were
                                therefore unwilling to leave in foreign hands.</p>
                            <p>Our first conference in the castle of Haute-Maison was generally kept
                                within the limits of an academical review of the past and present,
                                the real pith of which was confined to the declaration of Mr. J.
                                Favre that any sum of money possible (<hi rend="italic">tout
                                    l’argent que nous avons</hi>) would be paid, but that no cession
                                of territory could be made, After I had declared the latter to be
                                indispensable, he said that no negotiations for peace were possible,
                                his view being that cessions of territory would be degrading, nay,
                                even disgraceful to France. I did not succeed in convincing him that
                                conditions whose fulfillment France had obtained from Italy, and had
                                demanded of Germany, without having been at war with either of the
                                two countries—conditions which France, without the slightest doubt,
                                would have imposed upon us if we had been conquered, and which had
                                been the result of almost every war, even of modernt imes—could be
                                in no wise disgraceful to a country conquered after a brave
                                resistance, and that the honor of France was not of a character
                                different from that of other countries. Nor could I bring Mr. Favre
                                to see that the restoration of Strasburg, so far as the point of
                                honor was concerned, could be of any more consequence than that of
                                Landau or Saarlouis, or that the violent conquests of Louis XIV were
                                no more closely bound up with the honor of France than those of the
                                first republic or of the first empire.</p>
                            <p>It was not until we met in Ferrières that our conversations took a
                                more practical turn, when they were on the subject of a truce, and
                                the fact of this having been their exclusive subject, refutes the
                                assertion that I declared that I desired a truce under no
                                circumstances. The manner in which Mr. Favre does me the honor, in
                                respect to this and other questions, to introduce me as saying, “<hi
                                    rend="italic">Il faudrait un armistice, et je n’en veux à aucun
                                    prix</hi>,” together with other things of the same import,
                                forces me to make this correction, viz: That in such conversations I
                                never have expressed, and never do express myself, to the effect
                                that <hi rend="italic">I,</hi> personally, desire, refuse, or grant
                                anything, but always speak only of the views and requirements of the
                                governments whose business I have to transact. As a preliminary to
                                the conclusion of a truce, the necessity was <pb n="230"
                                    xml:id="pg_230" facs="0264"/>admitted in this conversation, on
                                both sides, of granting the French nation time to choose
                                representatives who should alone be able to establish the legitimacy
                                of the present government so far that the conclusion of a peace with
                                it, in accordance with the law of nations, might become possible. I
                                pointed to the fact that a truce is always attended with military
                                disadvantages for a victoriously advancing army, but in this case
                                would afford an excellent opportunity for the defense of France and
                                for the reorganization of its army, and that we, therefore, could
                                not grant a truce without a military equivalent. I designated, as
                                such, the surrender of the fortresses which hampered our
                                communication with Germany, because, in view of the prolongation of
                                the period for which we should have to subsist our troops, in
                                consequence of an intervening truce, a facilitation of this,
                                subsistence must be made a preliminary condition. The fortresses
                                alluded to were Strasburg, Toul, and a few smaller places. In
                                relation to Strasburg, I remarked that its capture must soon take
                                place, since the crowning of the glacis was complete, and we,
                                therefore, thought the surrender of the garrison required by the
                                military situation, while those of the other fortresses would be at
                                liberty to march out unmolested. Another difficult question was with
                                regard to Paris. Since we had completely shut in this city, we could
                                only permit its communications to be reopened if the reprovisioning
                                of the place, which would thus be rendered possible, would not
                                weaken our own military position, and lengthen the time required for
                                the reduction of the place by hunger. After a consultation with the
                                military authorities, I finally presented the following alternative,
                                by the most high command of his Majesty the King, with regard to the
                                city of Paris:</p>
                            <p>Either the position of Paris is to be given up to us by the surrender
                                of a controlling part of the fortifications; at this price, we are
                                ready to allow communication with Paris to be carried on without
                                hinderance, and to allow any provisioning of the city.</p>
                            <p>Or the position of Paris is not to be given up to us. In this case we
                                cannot consent to the raising of the blockade, but must let the <hi
                                    rend="italic">maintenance of the military status quo</hi> be the
                                basis of a truce, since otherwise the consequence of the latter
                                would only be that, after the expiration of the truce, Paris, newly
                                provisioned and equipped, would be all the better prepared to oppose
                                us.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Favre rejected the first alternative, containing the surrender of
                                a part of the fortifications, as positively as the condition that
                                the garrison of Strasburg should be prisoners of war. He promised,
                                however, to ask the opinion of his colleagues with regard to the
                                second alternative, which was to maintain the military <hi
                                    rend="italic">status quo</hi> before Paris. The programme which
                                Mr. Favre took to Paris as the result of our conversations, and
                                which was there rejected, contained, therefore, nothing at all with
                                regard to future terms of peace, but did contain an assent to a
                                truce of from fourteen days to three weeks, in order to allow the
                                election of a national assembly, on the following conditions:</p>
                            <p>1st. At and before Paris the maintenance of the military <hi
                                    rend="italic">status quo.</hi></p>
                            <p>2d. At and before Metz, continuation of hostilities within a circle
                                around Metz, to be more particularly defined.</p>
                            <p>3d. Surrender of Strasburg, together with the garrison as prisoners
                                of war; of Toul and Bitsch, their garrisons to be allowed to depart
                                unmolested. I think that our opinion that we made a very favorable
                                offer will be shared by all neutral cabinets. The French government,
                                by its unwillingness to take advantage of the opportunity offered it
                                for the choice of a national assembly, even within the portions of
                                France occupied by us, proclaims its determination to keep up the
                                difficulties in which it now is, with regard to the conclusion of a
                                peace, in accordance with the law of nations, and not to listen to
                                the voice of the French people. That general and free elections
                                would have resulted in favor of peace is an impression which forces
                                itself upon us here, and Which has, in all probability, been felt by
                                the authorities in Paris.</p>
                            <p>I very respectfully request your excellency to be pleased to bring
                                the present dispatch to the notice of the government to which you

                            plenipotentiary of the North German Union, inclosing a copy of a

                            giving a statement of the negotiations which took place between himself
                            and Mr. Jules Favre.</p>

                            Bismarck, of the 4th instant, received yesterday, I have the honor to
                            submit to you the inclosed copy, with translation, of a memorial in
                            regard to the fatal consequences which unavoidably must follow if the
                            inhabitants of Paris, or rather those who exercise the power in that
                            city, should continue in their resistance <pb n="232" xml:id="pg_232"
                                facs="0266"/>to the moment when the want of provisions will compel
                            them to surrender.</p>
                        <p>Count Bismarck expresses the deep regret of the belligerent German
                            governments that these consequences cannot be avoided by them, feeling
                            obliged to declare that they are not responsible for the unavoidable
                            misery to come, and that they must leave such responsibility to those
                            who, by continual instigation and false reports, excite the population
                            of Paris to a useless resistance, when a moment of cool reflection could
                            save them.</p>

                            <p>The conditions of an armistice offered to M. Jules Favre, intended as
                                the basis for the reëstablishment of order in France, have been
                                rejected by him and his colleagues. They thereby decree the
                                continuation of a struggle which, according to the course of late
                                events, appears without any chance of success for the French people.
                                Since then the prospects of France in this war, so full of
                                sacrifices, have still further declined. Toul and Strasburg have
                                fallen; Paris is closely surrounded, and German troops are advancing
                                along the Loire. The large forces before engaged near the above
                                fortresses are now at the free disposal of the German
                                commanders.</p>
                            <p>The country has to bear the consequences of a war, “à outrance,”
                                decreed by the French authorities in Paris. Its sacrifices will be
                                unnecessarily increased, and its social condition suffer a more and
                                more dangerous decomposition.</p>
                            <p>The command of the German armies does not find itself in a situation
                                to counteract this, but it perceives clearly the consequences of the
                                resistance chosen by the powers in France, and feels compelled to
                                call general attention to one point, namely, the special condition
                                of Paris.</p>
                            <p>The heaviest attacks heretofore made from this capital, (on the 19th
                                and 30th of last month,) in which the elite of the armies collected
                                in that city have not been able to throw back the first line of the
                                besieging force, lead to the conviction that the capital will fall
                                sooner or later. If the time of surrender is postponed by the
                                “provisional government for the national defense” until the
                                threatening want of provisions necessitates a capitulation, the most
                                terrible results must follow.</p>
                            <p>The unwise destruction of railways, bridges, and canals at a certain
                                distance around Paris by the French has not been able to stop for
                                one moment the advance of the German armies. All communications by
                                land or water needed for military operations have been reestablished
                                in a very short time. These repairs naturally regard military
                                interests exclusively, while the other destructions, even after a
                                capitulation, will prevent for a long time the communication of the
                                capital with the provinces.</p>
                            <p>It will be an absolute impossibility for the German commanders, when
                                that case occurs, to provide one single day’s rations for a
                                population of nearly two millions. The environs of Paris, to the
                                distance of several days’ journey, since all stores there are
                                necessarily required for the use of the German troops, will then
                                offer no resources, and will not permit the inhabitants of Paris to
                                evacuate by the roads into the country. The inevitable result would
                                be the starvation of hundreds of thousands. The persons in power in
                                France cannot fail to discern these consequences as clearly as the
                                German commanders, and since to the latter nothing is left but to
                                carry on the war proffered, the rulers of France are responsible for
                                forcing such extremes.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Great exertions are being made here to
                            induce the government to abandon its neutrality and to declare itself on
                            one side or the other. It seems to be the general opinion that if the
                            country were prepared for war it would declare it, and try to draw from
                            it certain political advantages, such as a revision of the treaty of
                            Paris, and territorial extensions on the Black or Baltic Seas. The
                            feeling in favor of France is perhaps stronger since the recent
                            successes of Prussia, and the leading journals have every day articles
                            showing how unfortunate for Europe and for free government would be the
                            increase and consolidation of a great military power like North Germany.
                            Only one paper, the Novoe Vremya, (New Time,) the organ of the old
                            conservative party, with a very limited circulation, demands that Russia
                            take up arms, and that to assist the French. The Legal Messenger regards
                            it as certain that Russia will eventually fight, but on the Prussian
                            side. This seems to be the fear of everybody, judging from the numerous
                            articles which condemn such a course. The officers of the army are said
                            to be nearly unanimous in favor of France and of a war with Prussia, and
                            I know of several occasions when toasts have been drunk to the ruin of
                            the Germans and of “Fritz.”</p>
                        <p>It is difficult to see how Russia would gain any advantage by taking part
                            in a war of this kind, even if Austria were engaged. Meanwhile the
                            government is using every effort to prepare for eventualities. It is
                            impossible not to notice that the vicinities of all the barracks show a
                            great stir. Hospital wagons and camp equipage are being repaired and <pb
                                n="234" xml:id="pg_234" facs="0268"/>put in order. The cartridge
                            factories are running constantly day and night, turning out about
                            500,000 metallic shells daily. These are now being filled and sent to
                            the frontier in large quantities. An additional order for 100 Gatling
                            guns has been sent to America in the last few days, making 210 in
                            all.</p>
                        <p>Fears are being expressed lest Russia should lose even the advantages of
                            neutrality, and lest England should succeed in getting the upper hand in
                            diplomacy and negotiation.</p>
                        <p>The Moscow Gazette, while confident that Russia will occupy a position
                            worthy of herself after this crisis is over, says that neutrality must
                            not be inaction, but a preparation for events, and covertly accuses
                            England of trying to overreach and get the better of Russia in the
                            recent negotiations about Belgium.</p>
                        <p>The late successes of the German army have directed attention to the
                            vulnerable points of Russia in case of the complete victory of Prussia.
                            There are two, Poland and the Baltic provinces.</p>
                        <p>Polish intrigues are more active than ever, but the Polish question, if
                            raised at all, will be raised by Austria, which is thought here to be
                            falling completely into Polish hands, and not by Prussia, who has a
                            somewhat unquiet Polish population of her own.</p>
                        <p>Circulars have been lately sent from abroad to the Catholic priests in
                            Poland and the northwestern provinces, recommending preparation, and
                            urging them to extend, by all means, their influence among the people.
                            In fact, the northwestern provinces seem to disquiet Russia more than
                            Poland proper. In them the government counted on the orthodox clergy,
                            the peasantry, and the few Russian proprietors; but the liberals hold
                            that the administration of General Potapof has, by deferring too much to
                            the Catholic priesthood, lowered the status and influence of the
                            orthodox clergy, and has, by not rightly carrying out the orders of
                            emancipation, alienated the peasantry, 100,000 of whom were Russian
                            dissenters, animated by the most patriotic feelings for the country, and
                            were a valuable support.</p>
                        <p>At the same time the proprietors are no nearer being conciliated. It is,
                            therefore, considered by many that the situation is dangerous, and
                            should Russia form any alliance this point will be carefully
                            safeguarded.</p>
                        <p>In the Baltic provinces all the political power is possessed by some
                            200,000 German nobles and merchants, who still keep the privileges
                            granted them by Peter the Great, on the conquest of the country, to the
                            exclusion of the 2,000,000 of natives and Russians who do not speak
                            German. Any attempt of the imperial government to introduce the Russian
                            language, instead of the German, as the official language, or to make
                            liberal reforms in the judicial proceedings or in the city government,
                            is vigorously resisted by the Germans, who immediately cry out that they
                            are oppressed and persecuted. Their leaders have more than once pointed
                            to Prussia as their natural defender and protector, and there is a party
                            in Prussia which has espoused their cause, and threatens difficulties
                            with the Russian government. These questions, indeed, in the North
                            German Reichstag, have always been evaded and opposed by the Prussian
                            government; but people here think that, should Prussia be successful and
                            Germany become united, a strong effort will be made to make the Baltic
                            question an international one, to claim the Baltic provinces as part of
                            Germany, and to detach them from Russia. Dislike to, and suspicion of,
                            these Baltic Germans is one cause of the feeling against Prussia.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> There are no new developments herewith
                            regard to the war. Russia still preserves her neutrality unbroken. The
                            visit of Count Cholsk, the Austrian minister, to Vienna caused a good
                            deal of talk in the Austrian papers, but, whatever may have been its
                            reasons, there are no evident results.</p>
                        <p>The armaments have been pushed on fast, and it is said the government is
                            now in condition to put 500,000 men into the held at a moment’s
                            notice.</p>
                        <p>The Golos says that Russia is completely armed and ready for war; the St.
                            Petersburg Gazette thinks not. The journals are calculating the chances
                            of intervention or of war, and showing that its possibility increases
                            every day. The Gazette of the Bourse says that Russia has done more for
                            neutrality than any other nation; it has kept Austria, quiet by its
                            threats, and has succeeded, through the influence of the Emperor and of
                            the crown prince, in preventing Denmark from taking the side of France.
                            The stay of the crown prince and his wife at Copenhagen has been greatly
                            prolonged, but they are expected back now in about a fortnight. The
                            Golos has had several articles on the position of Russia as a neutral
                            power, and shows that she is the only one which cannot readily acquiesce
                            in the aggrandizement and conquests of Prussia. If the treaty of Paris
                            is to be considered binding on Russia, while other powers have broken it
                            and seek better conditions of development, Russia is then defenseless in
                            the south, and at the mercy of Germany and England. The last article
                            ends thus: “Russia ought to keep her neutrality so long as her interests
                            are untouched. But they may be touched if, in a coming congress, or on
                            the conclusion of peace, the treaty of Paris remains unchanged. Russia
                            has not hindered the forcible unification of Germany, and, in its turn,
                            does not think of a forcible unification of the Slavonians. But it has
                            the right to demand that its position on the Black Sea and on the banks
                            of the Danube be lightened. We may hope that these <hi rend="italic"
                                >lawful demands</hi> will be respected in the general European
                            congress which will probably follow the present war.”</p>
                        <p>It is generally thought that now is the time for recovering the rights
                            which were lost by the issue of the Crimean war.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> The Federal Assembly of Switzerland
                            concluded its regular summer session on Saturday, the 24th instant. Much
                            of the time of the session was occupied in considering and adopting
                            measures for the effective <pb n="236" xml:id="pg_236" facs="0270"
                            />maintenance of the neutrality in the war which has broken out so
                            unexpectedly between France and the North German Confederation.</p>
                        <p rend="center">* * * * * *</p>
                        <p>There is a noticeable clause in the message of the Federal Council
                            affirming the right of Switzerland under the treaties of 1815 to take
                            military occupation, in case of war, of North Savoy, of the district
                            known as the Chablais, notwithstanding the fact that it has since become
                            a part of French territory. Such right of occupation was conceded as
                            essential to the maintenance of the neutrality of Switzerland at the
                            date of those treaties. Intimations have appeared in the European press
                            that Switzerland has been encouraged by some great power to put forward
                            this pretension at the present time with a view to embarrassing France,
                            since nothing was heard of it during the late Italian war. There is,
                            however, every reason to believe that Switzerland, in tends to act in
                            good faith in maintaining her neutrality, and that as far as possible
                            she will avoid giving any reasonable pretext for complaint to either of
                            the belligerent powers. At the same time there is little doubt but, at
                            the present time, the sympathies of a large part of her people are
                            strongly with the North German Confederation.</p>
                        <p>Prior to the adjournment the legislative body conferred the amplest
                            powers upon the Federal Council in calling out troops, borrowing money,
                            and doing whatever in its discretion may be necessary for the defense of
                            the country. The general-in-chief of the army, General Hans Herzog, was
                            elected by ballot by the Federal Assembly, and an army of 37,500 has
                            already been put in the field for the protection of the frontiers.</p>
                        <p>No definite action was taken upon the report of the Federal Council
                            respecting a revision of the federal constitution; but the whole subject
                            was referred to a committee which will sit during the autumn months, and
                            will submit a report to the Federal Assembly at its session in December
                            next.</p>
                        <p>I learn that recently the government of Great Britain has given an order
                            for the manufacture of 40,000 Martini rifles in Switzerland, finding
                            that they can be made more cheaply here than in England. The order,
                            however, cannot be filled at present, since the manufactories are now
                            engaged in completing a supply for Switzerland.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> Immediately after the announcement of the
                            new provisional government in France, the republican members of the
                            committee asked that the Cortes be assembled at an early day. Although
                            they were supported by the partisans of the Duke of Montpensier, the
                            friends of the administration in the committee, led by Mr. Sagasta, the
                            secretary of state, opposed the proposition as inopportune, and it was
                            defeated.</p>
                        <p>I was not unprepared for this action, General Prim having intimated to me
                            the day before the committee met, that, in his opinion, the irregular
                            and exceptional manner in which the new government in France had <pb
                                n="237" xml:id="pg_237" facs="0271"/>been inaugurated seriously
                            impaired its influence, and that the unfortunate circumstances under
                            which it assumed power were unfavorable to its duration. It was evident
                            that the president of the council did not regard the republican movement
                            in Paris as having attained proportions which would seriously disturb
                            the situation in Spain. Meetings have been held in several of the
                            principal towns, expressing sympathy with the popular reaction in
                            France. The radical press of Madrid and the provinces is loud in its
                            appeals to the government to seize this opportunity to complete the
                            programme of the Spanish revolution by abolishing the monarchy. The
                            republican deputies, some sixty or more in number, propose to issue an
                            address to the nation, in which they will decline any further
                            responsibility for the attitude of the people in view of the refusal of
                            the government to convene the Cortes.</p>
                        <p>Yesterday the journals published the correspondence between the Spanish
                            ambassador in Paris and the French minister of foreign affairs, in which
                            Mr. Olozaga states that he has been directed to enter into official
                            relations with the provisional government. The reply of M. Jules Favre
                            treats this communication as an acknowledgment of the republic on the
                            part of Spain, and appeals to her Latin sympathies to join France in
                            asserting the principle of self-government. This action of the Spanish
                            cabinet was as gratifying to the republicans as it was unpalatable to
                            the monarchical party, until it transpired that by some inadvertence the
                            Spanish ambassador must have exceeded his instructions, as the
                            ministerial organs affirm that he was expressly directed to hold no
                            other than unofficial relations with the present de facto government in
                            France, and it is now said that Mr. Olozaga has been summoned to Madrid
                            for explanations.</p>
                        <p rend="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>A profound impression has been made in all political circles by the
                            reported action of the president in tendering his good offices to the
                            belligerents in opening negotiations for peace. And it is not too much
                            to say that the expression of our interest in the welfare of France, now
                            that she has unfurled the republican flag, has rebuked the suggestions
                            that the republic would find itself more isolated than the empire, and
                            has, at least, checked the disposition that was at once evinced in some
                            quarters to turn the reverses France must yet suffer to the detriment of
                            popular institutions.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> The Turkish government, however favorably
                            it may have been disposed toward its ancient ally, France, in the
                            beginning of the present war between Prussia and France, has been
                            constrained by the character of the contest and the attitude of other
                            powers to observe the strictest neutrality. It has been obliged,
                            however, to largely increase its armaments, in order to be prepared for
                            future contingencies. The impaired military power and prestige of France
                            is a source of serious apprehension to the Porte. Upon that power it has
                            always relied when <pb n="238" xml:id="pg_238" facs="0272"/>the
                            integrity, of the empire was assailed, and it has ever found it ready to
                            respond to appeal for aid. Outside of France, England is the only other
                            power which may be regarded as a permanent ally of Turkey. Austria aims
                            at her spoliation on the Adriatic and Danube. Italy is regarded as the
                            instrument of greater powers, and as likely to take any course which her
                            ambition and interests may dictate. Prussia is regarded as the secret
                            ally of Russia in oriental matters, and as disposed to directly or
                            indirectly further the views of the latter in the East. Russia, whatever
                            may be her professions of good will, is rightfully looked upon as a
                            neutral enemy to Turkey, and as constantly intriguing for the
                            dismemberment of the empire. If Prussia shall succeed in yet further
                            enfeebling France, the position of the Porte will become very critical,
                            and the more so as Russia has preserved her military resources intact.
                            The system of railways in Russia, interlocking, as it does, all points
                            of the empire, and converging on the Austrian and Turkish frontiers,
                            enables Russia to throw her whole army on any given point at any moment,
                            and to attack Turkey with an overwhelming might, while keeping open her
                            lines of communication.</p>
                        <p>Russia, with the consummate diplomatic sagacity and craft that
                            distinguishes her, will try to take advantage of the crisis and provoke
                            a revision of the treaties of 1856, by which the Black Sea was
                            neutralized, and the Bosphorus and Dardanelles were closed to the
                            passage of her vessels of war. It will be strange if she does not
                            succeed, aiming, as she will, to obtain honorable conditions of peace
                            for France, and exercising, as she will, a dominating influence in
                            settling the terms of peace. The Black Sea opened to the fleets of
                            Russia, Sebastopol again a naval dock-yard and harbor, and the Bosphorus
                            and Dardanelles free for the passage of Russian men-of-war,
                            Constantinople would be in constant danger, and could be attacked and
                            taken before it could be relieved by outside aid.</p>
                        <p>It will thus be seen that the oriental question is likely soon to be
                            reopened, and under very unfavorable auspices to the security of
                            Turkey.</p>
                        <p>The Viceroy of Egypt, although nominally now in good relations with the
                            Porte, is really intriguing again for independence. He is in secret
                            relations with Russia, and will take advantage of circumstances to
                            realize his ambitious aspirations. It is not altogether improbable that
                            he might become sovereign of an Arabic kingdom, including Syria, the
                            pashalic of Tripoli, Arabia, Egypt, and possibly Abyssinia also.</p>
                        <p>Roumania is in a state of agitation, fomented by foreign influences, and
                            a revolution there, ending in the expulsion of Prince Charles, is not
                            improbable. Should such a revolution occur, it may lead to a tripartite
                            occupation of the country by Russia, Austria, and Turkey, and its
                            eventual absorption by Austria and Russia. A revolution in Roumania is
                            desired by certain parties, in order to increase the necessity of
                            another European congress. Above all these contingencies looms the
                            specter of a great republican confederation, composed of republics in
                            France, Spain, Italy and Switzerland, and probably Greece. Should a
                            republic be declared in France, it will sooner or later be followed by
                            republics in Spain, Italy, and Greece, and the beginning of the end of
                            monarchy in Europe will be apparent. The institution of such governments
                            would naturally lead to a confederation between them, and one-half of
                            Europe would thus become republican. The policy of such a confederation
                            would be a peaceful one; it would lead to the suppression of standing
                            armies, to the cessation of war, perhaps of ambition, and to the
                            elevation and improvement of the moral and intellectual condition of the
                            masses, who have heretofore too often been considered only as the blind
                            instruments of the mad ambition of kings. Such a confederation would be
                            a natural ally of the United <pb n="239" xml:id="pg_239" facs="0273"
                            />States, increasing our moral and political power and rendering us yet
                            more secure against the intrigues, jealousies, and hostility of those
                            governments which desire our downfall and the dissolution of the
                            American Union. Although we cannot promote the creation of such
                            political combinations, we can have no reason to regret the rise of
                            governmental forms which will deliver Europe from the scourge of
                            constantly renewing wars, and which will put an end to the abuses and
                            evils against which outraged humanity has for centuries protested in
                            vain. Past experience will teach the necessity of establishing future
                            European republics on a firm basis that will guarantee their induring
                            existence, and we shall not again see the short-lived and disastrous
                            experiments at republican government which we have hitherto witnessed in
                            Europe.</p>
                        <p>Although we cannot safely predict the political future of Europe for any
                            long period ahead from the standpoint of view I occupy here, I am
                            however persuaded that we are on the eve of great changes, and tending
                            in the drift above suggested, and having an inevitable tendency to
                            vastly increase the authority of the United States over governments of a
                            kindred form, and with like political sympathies.</p>

                            with a view to promote the adoption, by the legislatures of the several
                            powers, of a common unit and standard of an international gold
                            coinage.”</p>
                        <p>I presume that it will not be necessary to present to the enlightened
                            governments with which this correspondence is invited any considerations
                            in favor of the adoption of such a common unit and standard. That it
                            will simplify the daily business transactions of the world, and that it
                            will bring into closer communion the nations that adopt it, is manifest.
                            The Government of the United States, therefore, in opening this
                            correspondence, at the request of the Senate, limits itself to the
                            presentation of the objections that have been hitherto raised against
                            such unification, in the hope that some plan may be devised which will
                            obviate them. In doing this we must necessarily regard the subject,
                            primarily, as it effects our own commerce and trade.</p>
                        <p>The principal part of the trade and commerce of the United States is
                            carried on with four groups of countries:</p>
                        <p>First. Those in which the accounts are rendered and settled in sterling
                            currency.</p>
                        <p>Second. Those in which they are rendered and settled in francs.</p>
                        <p>Third. Those in which they are rendered and settled in the North German
                            unit of account.</p>
                        <p>Fourth. Those in which they are rendered and settled in dollars.</p>
                        <p>In commenting upon the commerce with these several countries, I shall
                            adopt for convenience the returns for the year 1867, and I shall make
                            the statements in round numbers.</p>
                        <p>The first of these groups comprises the United Kingdom of Great Britain
                            and Ireland, the various British colonies and dependencies, India,
                            China, and Japan. I add the last two countries to the list, because I
                            understand that most of the settlements are made in sterling bills,
                            although the accounts are kept in Chinese taels or Mexican dollars. Our
                            aggregate annual domestic exports to these countries are about
                            $275,000,000, and our aggregate annual imports from the same countries
                            are about $220,000,000.</p>
                        <p>With the countries in which the franc is the unit of account, viz.,
                            France, Italy, Switerland, and Belgium, the dealings of the United
                            States are less extensive. The domestic exports to these countries are
                            about $57,000,000, and the imports from them are less than $50,000,000.
                                <pb n="241" xml:id="pg_241" facs="0275"/>It is to be remembered,
                            however, in this connection, that Austria, Greece, and Sweden have
                            adopted, or propose to adopt, a unit of gold coinage which can be
                            expressed in a given number of francs. I do not understand, however,
                            that they propose to adopt the French system of money.</p>
                        <p>The exports to the third group of countries amount to $27,000,000, and
                            the imports from them to $26,500,000.</p>
                        <p>When it is remembered that the entire imports of the United States are
                            about $418,000,000, and the entire exports are about $440,000,000, it
                            will be seen that the commerce with the countries comprised in these
                            three groups amounts to more than three-fourths of the whole foreign
                            trade of the country, and that the commerce with the first group only is
                            more than one-half the aggregate foreign commerce of the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>The fourth group includes the United States and their Territories, with
                            all their domestic commerce, and also such neighboring dominions of
                            other powers as have practically adopted the dollar standard. In
                            magnitude this trade far surpasses all the others combined. Its results
                            are expressed in the permanent capital of the country. A change in the
                            value of the unit of account affects not only all this commerce, but
                            also all the contracts for the payment of money in the United States,
                            including the national debt, and the value of all the permanent capital
                            of the country. Any material change in the unit would render necessary a
                            series of computations, which would occasion an amount of inconvenience
                            to the population of the United States for which the benefits they would
                            receive from the change would scarcely compensate.</p>
                        <p>The same may be said of the effect of a material change in the value of
                            its unit of account upon the domestic trade and property of each of the
                            other groups of countries.</p>
                        <p>If, therefore, the idea of “a common unit and standard of an
                            international coinage” is to be carried to the extent of an absolute
                            identity in the coins, it will be necessary to seek for a basis of
                            unification which complies with the following requisites, so far as it
                            may affect the coinage of the United States, and, probably, the same may
                            be said, <hi rend="italic">mutatis mutandis,</hi> as to Great Britain
                            and France:</p>
                        <p>First. It must be one that does not materially vary from the existing
                            coinage.</p>
                        <p>Second. It must be one that will be acquiesced in by the government of
                            the United Kingdom, and by the countries which express their values in
                            francs.</p>
                        <p>It would also be extremely desirable, though not absolutely essential, so
                            far as the interests of the United States are concerned, (whose commerce
                            is mainly with the powers whose values are expressed in sterling or
                            francs,) that it should be acceptable to the other leading powers.</p>
                        <p>It is also indispensable that gold should be made the sole standard.
                            France still adheres to the double standard; but, in the opinion of the
                            Government of the United States, it will not be practicable to unify the
                            coinage of the world on the basis of a double standard. The resolution
                            of the Senate aims at a correspondence for the unification of gold
                            coinage only.</p>
                        <p>Several attempts have been already made to secure the desired
                            uniformity.</p>
                        <p>The coinage of Belgium, Switzerland, and Italy was assimilated by
                            convention in 1865 to that of France, and the issues of each country
                            regulated thereby; and it has been assumed that the uniformity, so
                            easily secured in these territories, may be extended with equal ease.
                            But it <pb n="242" xml:id="pg_242" facs="0276"/>is to be observed that
                            the formation of the kingdom of Italy out of a number of independent
                            sovereignties, with a heterogeneous medley of coinages, afforded an
                            occasion and an opportunity for remodeling the coinage of that country
                            which does not exist with the United States or with the United Kingdom.
                            No reasoning, therefore, can be drawn from the example of Italy.</p>
                        <p>In the International Monetary Conference held at Paris in 1867, on the
                            invitation of the French government, this subject was elaborately
                            considered. The government of Great Britain was represented by Mr.
                            Graham, the director of the royal mint, and by Mr. Rivers Wilson,
                            attached to the treasury. The Government of the United States was
                            represented by Mr. Samuel B. Ruggles, one of its most eminent
                            statisticians.</p>
                        <p>That conference determined unanimously (voting by states) “against the
                            creation of an entirely new system, independent of existing systems,”
                            and in favor of the mutual coordination of existing systems, taking into
                            account the scientific advantages of certain types, and the numbers of
                            the population that have already adopted them.’’</p>
                        <p>It was also determined, with like unanimity, that the monetary system
                            established by the convention of 1865 should be the one to be
                            principally considered by the conference.</p>
                        <p>It was decided to recommend gold for the standard, with silver as a
                            transitory companion, and to adopt as the common denominator, for the
                            basis of the desired assimilation, the weight of five francs in gold of
                            nine-tenths fineness. On the last question the vote of England was
                            recorded in the negative, and the vote of the United States in the
                            affirmative.</p>
                        <p>It was unanimously determined to adopt the twenty-five-franc piece, with
                            which it was supposed that the American half-eagle and the British
                            sovereign could be made identical in form, size, weight, and fineness,
                            so that, in the language of Mr. Buggies, they “would readily circulate
                            side by side with the French twenty-five franc piece on conditions of
                            perfect equality.” The values of the dollar and the cent, of the
                            shilling and the penny, were, under this scheme, to be all changed and
                            made to conform to the new measures.</p>
                        <p>I inclose a copy of the report of the proceedings of the conference,
                            prepared by a French delegate, M. de Parieu, vice-president of the
                            council of state, member of the institute, and vice-president of the
                            conference.</p>
                        <p>It is understood in Washington that the British government has not yet
                            shown a willingness to give its adhesion to the plan proposed by the
                            conference, notwithstanding the favor with which it was received by the
                            delegates of Great Britain in Paris. We are informed that that
                            government is not disposed to adopt the proposition while a double
                            standard is maintained in France. Nor has the Congress of the United
                            States shown a disposition to authorize the Executive Department of this
                            Government to reduce the values of the coins of the United States to the
                            proposed measures.</p>
                        <p>The plan of the conference would, if adopted, make a greater change
                            necessary in the coinage of the United States than in the coinage of the
                            United Kingdom. The reduction in the value of the gold dollar would be
                            about 3½ per cent., which would put the people of this country to great
                            inconvenience in their business.</p>
                        <p>The Senate, having before it a bill aiming at the adoption of the
                            recommendations of the monetary conference of Paris in the coinage of
                            this country, after full consideration, disposed of the subject by
                            referring <pb n="243" xml:id="pg_243" facs="0277"/>it to this Department
                            in the manner I have already indicated. This was done on the motion of
                            the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Finance, whose letter to
                            Mr. Ruggles in Paris had more, perhaps, than any other cause, given
                            vitality to the scheme proposed by the conference.</p>
                        <p>The House of Representatives has before it two bills. One of these,
                            introduced and advocated by Mr. Kelley, of the Committee on Coinage,
                            Weights, and Measures, proposes to substitute for the present system of
                            coinage what is known here as the dollar system, to which I shall soon
                            allude. The other, introduced by Mr. Hooper, of Massachusetts, aims to
                            carry into effect the recommendations of the Paris conference. But, in a
                            speech in the House after the introduction of this bill, Mr. Hooper
                            said, “Any change of coinage, so great as to be accounted for, involves
                            an inconvenience in the payment of prior contracts, and particularly in
                            the payment of the interest and principal of public and corporate debts,
                            which inconvenience is thought by some to be very much greater than the
                            international convenience arising from conformity of coinage. The whole
                            question appears to demand that an attempt should be made to arrive at
                            some agreement with Great Britain for an international coinage, in which
                            the nations of continental Europe could be reasonably expected to join
                            at no distant period.”</p>
                        <p>Both bills were referred by the House to the committee; and it would
                            appear reasonable to conclude that the House, as well as the Senate, is
                            not disposed to adopt the suggestions of the Paris conference without
                            further communication with the British government.</p>
                        <p>Without expressing on behalf of the Executive Department of this
                            Government a decided opinion upon the merits of the franc system, I may
                            say that, if there is to be unification, the Government of the United
                            States would prefer a scale assimilating nearer to its present system.
                            In any event, the extent of the dealings between this country and Great
                            Britain makes it proper that, before the President can consent to
                            recommend Congress to subject the citizens of the United States to the
                            annoyance, inconvenience, and loss which maybe caused by a large
                            depreciation in the national measure of values, he shall have assurance
                            that the assent of her Majesty’s government can be relied upon.</p>
                        <p>Another scheme for unification which has been presented to the
                            consideration of this Government has been already referred to as the
                            dollar scheme. This scheme proposes a reduction in the value of the
                            dollar of three-tenths of 1 per cent., in order to make the coin of
                            metrical weight, so that three dollars coined of nine-tenths fineness
                            shall weigh five grams, while two dollars shall contain three grams of
                            fine gold. It also contemplates that the British penny shall be
                            equivalent to two metric cents, and that the sovereign and a new French
                            coin of twenty-five francs shall each be brought to the weight,
                            fineness, size, and value of the half-eagle as reduced.</p>
                        <p>This plan is one very favorable to the United States. The change is
                            within the mint tolerance, and need not be accounted for. It would also
                            adapt itself without change to the new German system of coinage, two
                            eagles being equal to three vereinskrone.</p>
                        <p>Should the governments of Great Britain and France be disposed to join
                            the Government of the United States in recommending the adoption of this
                            system, the President is prepared to advise Congress to adapt the
                            coinage of the United States to it.</p>
                        <p>But we cannot shut our eyes to the fact that it may not meet with favor
                            in Great Britain, when it calls for an increase in the value of the <pb
                                n="244" xml:id="pg_244" facs="0278"/>gold coins of about 2½ per
                            cent.; nor in France, where it requires an increase of 3¼ per cent.</p>
                        <p>Should it be found that neither of these schemes can be made acceptable
                            to all the powers, and that no other plan can be proposed which is
                            likely to be adopted, perhaps a way may be found for securing “a common
                            unit and standard” by an <hi rend="italic">assimilation</hi> without an
                            absolute <hi rend="italic">unification</hi> in the coinage.</p>
                        <p>The schemes which I have been considering contemplate absolute identity
                            of coinage in some common coin. It must be conceded that this is
                            theoretically to be desired. But as it may be impracticable for the
                            moment, this Government suggests a basis which, though theoretically
                            less perfect than an absolute unification of coinage, may practically
                            secure some of its benefits, and lead to more important advantages.</p>
                        <p>It is to be observed that an identity in the measures of values in the
                            different countries will not completely attain the beneficent results
                            which are sought, unless there be also an identity in weights and
                            measures.</p>
                        <p>The comparatively few persons of each country who travel into the
                            dominions of the other powers, and spend there the money which sometimes
                            had better be spent at home, might and probably would find their means
                            slightly increased, and their annoyances decidedly decreased; but in
                            commercial transactions an identity in the measures of values would be
                            of comparatively little use, if unaccompanied by an identity in the
                            measures of the quantities to which those values are applied. There
                            would still be a necessity for the intervention of an expert to shift
                            the expressions of the measures of quantity from the terms used in the
                            one country to those in use in the other. The resolution of the Senate
                            does not contemplate the extension of this correspondence to these
                            points, nor, in my judgment, would it be desirable to do so.</p>
                        <p>It would probably not be difficult to induce the people of different
                            countries to adopt a common standard of weights and measures, so far as
                            perishable property is concerned. At first the adoption of unaccustomed
                            systems might cause inconvenience and discontent; but if they should
                            prove to be better than the old ones, and if they should have the
                            further advantage of being common to several countries which possess a
                            common standard of values, and which have extended commercial relations,
                            it is probable that the inconveniences would be patiently submitted to,
                            in view of the greater benefits to be derived from the change.</p>
                        <p>But it seems to the Government of the United States that a forced change
                            in the measures of distance, as applied to imperishable property and to
                            permanent investments of capital, may be attended with more serious
                            inconvenience. Thus, while it may be practicable to establish a new
                            standard of length measure for articles of international commerce, such
                            as textile fabrics which are consumed and do not remain, it may be more
                            difficult to make the same change in the standard for permanent values.
                            A few examples will demonstrate the difficulties that would probably
                            attend a change in such measures in this country, and it is supposed
                            that similar if not equal inconveniences would happen elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>It is the custom in the United States to lay out all the towns and cities
                            in regular quadrangles, and to divide each quadrangle into an even
                            number of lots, with an even number of feet. This has been found a
                            convenient mode of dealing in town and city lots and in town and city
                            houses. To make an arbitrary change which should abolish these measures
                            and substitute different ones in their places, involving the use of
                            fractional numbers, would occasion great inconvenience, and might check
                                <pb n="245" xml:id="pg_245" facs="0279"/>the dealings in this
                            species of property, and thus cause a loss to those who happen to be
                            holders at the time of change.</p>
                        <p>Again, the whole system of titles in those States which have been created
                            out of the public domain rests upon Government surveys, whose, results
                            are expressed in the English mile and its subdivisions of rods, feet,
                            and inches. To substitute a different expression for these measurements
                            would be a work of serious magnitude.</p>
                        <p>Again, the manufactories of the country are filled with machinery, whose
                            delicately adjusted parts, measured by feet, inches, and component parts
                            of the inch, work together in one grand whole, which is in its turn
                            combined in the same system of measures. To produce this machinery,
                            thousands of shops are filled with costly plans, adjusted upon the same
                            scale, whose delicate operations often require a nicer determination of
                            measurement than can be obtained without mechanical aid. To transmute
                            these measurements, so delicate and so accurate, from their present
                            system into a new one, would appear to be an almost endless labor, if
                            indeed it be a possibility.</p>
                        <p>Examples might be multipled, and will probably occur to the enlightened
                            government of ——. They serve to show that, while in theory much to be
                            desired, it is possible that the different powers will not succeed so
                            easily in assimilating their several standards of length for permanent
                            values as in securing uniformity in their systems of weights and of
                            lineal measures, as applied to articles of commerce.</p>
                        <p>Accepting this possible result with reluctance, and drawing from it the
                            conclusion that unification of coinage, or even identity in the value of
                            a unit, may not be so easily attained, and will, if attained, have a
                            proportionately less importance, the Government of the United States
                            invites the —— government to consider whether, without seriously
                            disturbing the coinage of the leading commercial nations, and without
                            changing the nomenclature and relative values in the domestic coins to
                            which the several peoples have become accustomed, it may not be possible
                            to arrive at an assimilation of coinage which will secure many of the
                            advantages that can be obtained without a uniform system of weights and
                            measures, and which may lead hereafter to complete unification.</p>
                        <p>It must be borne in mind in this discussion that, so long as exchanges of
                            commodities exist, the system of payments therefor in bills of exchange
                            (which ordinarily represent values of commodities of the one country
                            transferred to the other) must also continue to exist. It is not
                            probable, that even an absolute identity of coinage throughout the world
                            would do away with this medium of payments. The hope that such would be
                            the case would probably prove illusory.</p>
                        <p>The object we seek to attain is a common measure, which can be expressed
                            in the existing coinages of the leading commercial nations without
                            materially affecting the actual values of the several coins.</p>
                        <p>Different rules pravail at the different mints in many respects. In some
                            there is a mint charge; in others, none. In some the coin is of
                            nine-tenths fineness; in others, of eleven-twelfths. Were we now seeking
                            uniformity in the weight, appearance, and value of the coins, it would
                            be necessary to adopt common rules in these respects. But it is supposed
                            that the several powers may be averse to surrender their respective
                            systems unless complete uniformity can be secured.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States suggests, for the consideration of
                            the several powers, whether all that is herein contemplated may not be
                            attained without an abandonment of the different mint systems. It
                            suggests (for consideration only, and not as the best theoretical
                            solution <pb n="246" xml:id="pg_246" facs="0280"/>of the question) that
                            the international value of the coins of the nations that may become
                            parties to any monetary convention, or who may in any other way arrange
                            this question between themselves, shall be de termined by the quantity
                            of pure gold which it contains, which measure shall be expressed in a
                            common standard of weight upon its face; and that, unless absolute
                            unification can be obtained, all other questions of coinage be left to
                            local law and experience. The French decigram is suggested as the most
                            convenient common measure by which to determine this quantity, and that
                            it is desirable, if possible, to avoid running this expression into a
                            fraction.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States suggests (also for consideration
                            only) the following as a practicable table:</p>

                            If adopted, they afford in the decigramme an international unit which

                            <p>The minutes of the seventh sitting having been adopted, on invitation
                                from his Imperial Highness, M. de Parieu read the following report,
                                which he had been instructed to prepare at the last sitting:</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Monseigneur and Gentlemen:</hi> In the month of
                                December last, when the French government communicated the
                                international convention of the 23d December, 1865, to the states
                                here represented, and called their attention to the grand idea of
                                monetary uniformity, those communications were at first received
                                with a certain hesitation in some particulars. We have been,
                                perhaps, too long accustomed to consign many generous ideas,
                                sustained only by common sense, to the region of dreams, leaving
                                them to be buried by prejudice and the blind consideration of the
                                immutability of existing facts. We all know that every enterprise of
                                general interest requires a spirit of unity in its aims and
                                principal means of accomplishment.</p>
                            <p>There were many points in the monetary question so difficult that
                                they caused divisions in the doctrines and the views of the
                                past.</p>
                            <p>The idea of monetary uniformity long languished in the aspirations of
                                poets and economists. The members of the convention of the 23d of
                                December, 1865, encouraged by the success of their labors, warmly
                                welcomed the practical idea of their extension; and on witnessing
                                the success of the monetary union concluded between France,
                                Belgium,. Switzerland, and Italy, notwithstanding the false
                                situation caused by the forced circulation of paper in one of the
                                states, it was hard for the government that had presided over the
                                conference of 1865 to refrain from asking the support of the world
                                for a more extended monetary uniformity.</p>
                            <p>The minister of foreign affairs has told you how much the imperial
                                government was pleased at the eagerness of all the sovereign states
                                of Europe, and of the government at Washington, in sending delegates
                                to the conference proposed to them. In giving to the assembly a
                                president whose great name, exalted position, manifest impartiality,
                                and decided sympathy for monetary uniformity, have given our
                                discussions a brilliancy and importance that we could not expect
                                from our own resources, it has complimented you more highly than
                                could be done by words, and has thanked you all, men distinguished
                                for diplomatic merits, economical science, or technical experience
                                in the monetary art, for the earnest welcome you have given to the
                                ideas you were called together to examine.</p>
                            <p>What was the precise object of your conference—the nature of the
                                questions it was to expound ?</p>
                            <p>This, gentlemen, was the first object of your reflections, and upon
                                it the success of your meeting depended. The government of the
                                Emperor might prepare the studies, but it could not fix the
                                terms.</p>
                            <p>Monetary science is vast; many of its problems are debated by
                                philosophers. Not one could be avoided; appeals were to be made to
                                reality, the only solvent of such <pb n="248" xml:id="pg_248"
                                    facs="0282"/>problems, and the one of particular importance in
                                the subject now before ns for consideration.</p>
                            <p>At the trade conference of 1864, in Frankfort, it was truly said, <hi
                                    rend="italic">“</hi>Monetary questions are more practical than
                                all others.”</p>
                            <p>The chief question for examination was the monetary standard.</p>
                            <p>On this subject you are aware that the world is divided between three
                                different systems—the gold standard, the silver standard, and the
                                double standard. It was indispensable to know which of these forms
                                would furnish the most desirable and permanent basis for a monetary
                                unity.</p>
                            <p>Governed by these considerations, you have agreed upon a series of
                                questions as the basis of your labors, on the report of a committee
                                of seven members, in the formation of which all the systems had been
                                equitably represented.</p>
                            <p>This “questionnaire,” to adopt a neologism of our administrative
                                language, you unanimously adopted in the following terms:</p>
                            <p>“1st. What is the best way to realize monetary unity—by the creation
                                of an entirely new system independent of existing systems, and in
                                that case what should be the basis of that system; or, by the
                                combination of present systems, taking into consideration the
                                scientific advantages of certain types, and the number of nations
                                that have already adopted them? In the latter case, what monetary
                                system ought to be chiefly considered, with the reserve of any
                                improvement that might be made in it?</p>
                            <p>“2d. Can identities or partial assimilations of monetary types be now
                                constituted on a large scale by adopting the silver standard
                                exclusively?</p>
                            <p>“3d. On the other hand, can that result be reached by adopting a gold
                                standard exclusively?</p>
                            <p>“4th. Could a similar result be attained by adopting the double
                                standard, and fixing in all the nations the relative value of gold
                                and silver?</p>
                            <p>“5th. In case of a negative response to the preceding questions, is
                                it possible or expedient to establish identity or partial
                                assimilation of monetary types on a large scale with a silver
                                standard, leaving each state the liberty of preserving its gold
                                standard?</p>
                            <p>“6th. Is it possible and useful to establish identity or partial
                                assimilation of monetary types on a gold basis, leaving each state
                                the liberty of preserving its silver standard?</p>
                            <p>“7th. In case of affirming one of the two preceding questions, would
                                the internationality of the coin adopted as a common standard be a
                                sufficient assurance of its continued circulation in each state; or
                                would it be necessary to stipulate a certain limit in the relation
                                between the value of gold and silver, or to provide for the case in
                                which international coins would run the risk of being expelled from
                                circulation in any of the contracting states?</p>
                            <p>“8th. For the success of monetary unity is it necessary to constitute
                                an identical unity of metallic composition everywhere with
                                similarity of weight and denomination, and what basis is to be
                                adopted; or is it enough to constitute common types of a common
                                denominator as high as multiples of five francs for gold?</p>
                            <p>“9th. In case gold is adopted as an international metal, would it be
                                useful for the types of that coin adopted by the monetary convention
                                of the 23d of December, 1865. to be completed by new types of
                                fifteen and twenty-five francs for the sake of unity and in the
                                spirit of reciprocity? In this case, what should be their
                                dimensions?</p>
                            <p>“10th. In case of affirmative to questions three or six, would it be
                                useful to regulate silver or copper coins by common obligations as
                                to their composition or standard, their limit in payment, or the
                                amount of their issue?</p>
                            <p>“11th. Would it be proper to fix certain means of control to insure
                                the exact coinage of the common types of the international
                                money?</p>
                            <p>“12th. Besides the immediate practical possibilities already
                                discussed, would further discussions of general principles be
                                desirable to spread over Europe the assimilations already effected
                                or hereafter to be realized in respect to money?”</p>
                            <p>Although no idea of exclusion has entered into this “questionnaire,”
                                it is remarkable that its discussion during five sittings has
                                suggested no serious addition; on the contrary, the tenth and
                                eleventh questions you have put off, although the principle of
                                measures of control has been judged indispensable to the success of
                                the monetary conventions, and the twelfth question was left
                                undecided.</p>
                            <p>The decisions of the conference, as a whole, have been regulated by
                                the dominant desire that any future monetary legislation shall
                                result, as far as practicable, in diplomatic conventions between
                                different states, to secure them against their own inconstancy. It
                                is the evident interest of the states to secure the political
                                advantages of the assimilation of their monetary types by the
                                reciprocal circulation of their coins.</p>
                            <p>You did not think the reciprocal circulation in public banks, as
                                resolved upon in 1865, completely answered the aspirations for a
                                monetary uniformity; and, contrary to some reserves found in your
                                minutes, you thought legal currency ought to be considered the last
                                word in the tendencies to unity.</p>
                            <p>The first nine questions of your sittings are comprised in three
                                formulas too abstract to be discussed, and I will reduce them to
                                their simplest form of expression.</p>
                            <pb n="249" xml:id="pg_249" facs="0283"/>
                            <p>The whole world agreeing upon the benefits to be derived from
                                monetary unity, but the difficulties and delays of effecting it
                                being very apparent, the question is, How can it be effected? By the
                                creation of a new monetary system established <hi rend="italic">a
                                    priori,</hi> or by strict adhesion to existing systems, or
                                simply by bending them, so to speak, and perfecting them
                                hereafter.</p>
                            <p>Such was the triple problem proposed for your solution.</p>
                            <p>All of your states, except Belgium, have agreed not to propose a new
                                system, lest such an undertaking might indefinitely delay the
                                desired monetary assimilation.</p>
                            <p>A new system would have probably been founded upon the adoption of a
                                decimal gold piece of a certain weight as a unity. You do not say
                                that such a regularity could be attained without difficulty, however
                                beautiful it might be in theory, and without disturbing inveterate
                                habits found in the attachment to the silver franc, almost a copy of
                                the old French <hi rend="italic">livre tournois.</hi></p>
                            <p>Instead of seeking a system new in all its parts, you have preferred
                                to adopt that of the monetary convention signed at Paris on the 23d
                                of December, 1865, and which being now adopted by Rome and Athens,
                                seems by a fortunate coincidence to reunite the greater portion of
                                the countries in which, at the close of ancient history,
                                civilization by various modes had marked out the perimeter of its
                                first empire.</p>
                            <p>The close union of this system, in its silver coins, with the
                                metrical weights, whether the coins be considered as a distinct
                                standard or as small change, and the 72,000,000 of people that use
                                it and are attached to it, have made you regard it as a center of
                                assimilation around which the efforts of other nations might cluster
                                with probabilities of success. But you did not look upon the system
                                as fixed and perfect.</p>
                            <p>You rightly thought it capable of contraction or extension; that,
                                though the unit was called a <hi rend="italic">franc</hi> here, a
                                    <hi rend="italic">lira</hi> there, and a <hi rend="italic"
                                    >drachma</hi> elsewhere, still a greater latitude was possible,
                                particularly in regard to the unit value.</p>
                            <p>Most of the civilized nations have a monetary unity above a franc in
                                value. The piastre, the thaler, the ruble, and the dollar, four
                                pieces similar in origin and name, are nearly the quadruple or
                                quintuple of the unit adopted in the convention of 1865.</p>
                            <p>If the German and Dutch florins and the Spanish crowns differ less
                                from the franc, on the other hand the wealthy British civilization
                                places its monetary unit much higher in value.</p>
                            <p>Though the small Roman state has converted its <hi rend="italic"
                                    >scudo,</hi> similar to the piastre and dollar, into francs, we
                                can hardly hope that larger and more populous states will
                                immediately adopt all the monetary unities we have reported in the
                                convention of the 23d of December, 1865. You have therefore, thought
                                proper to suggest a single unit as a common denominator, borrowed
                                from the system of the convention, around which the other unities
                                should circulate.</p>
                            <p>If silver had been adopted for the unitary basis, all other systems
                                might have been assimilated to the franc as a common denominator.
                                But could the silver franc have been the pivot of equations,
                                commensurabilities and coincidences desired in the monetary systems
                                we would like to make universal for the benefit of exchange, trade,
                                travel, financial, statistical, and scientific operations? To a
                                certain extent, this was the chief question for your
                                deliberations.</p>
                            <p>Here the laws that brought the precious metals into contact with the
                                wealth of communities, and which have twice given a monetary system
                                to the universe, came into consideration. The rule of these laws was
                                broken by the great historic catastrophe that separated ancient from
                                modern civilization by an intermediate period of poverty and
                                barbarism, but how strikingly reproduced after a lapse of nearly
                                eighteen centuries!</p>
                            <p>In the time of Augustus, when gold had gained the ascendency in money
                                circulation, the Roman poet exclaimed:</p>
                            <p rend="center">Æra dabant olim; melius nunc omen in auro est,</p>
                            <p rend="center">Victaque concedit prisca moneta novae.</p>
                            <p>From the Middle Ages to our day, the revolution that Ovid mentions
                                incompletely, for he omits silver, has lain quiet, till it breaks
                                out now with renewed strength and peculiar mineralogical,
                                industrial, and commercial circumstances. No new invasion of
                                barbarism can reverse its course in Europe, where silver first took
                                the place of iron and copper, and where silver is now displaced by
                                gold.</p>
                            <p>In most of the civilized nations of Europe and America, the latter
                                metal has become the principal instrument of circulation, because
                                its portability and density particularly recommend it as the
                                material for monetary unity. When the convention of the 23d
                                September, 1865, closed, three of the associate states wished gold
                                to be the choice of the convention. Even in the last century, a
                                learned man of Germany, where so many grand ideas originate,
                                declared that gold was destined to become the bond of the monetary
                                systems of the universe.</p>
                            <p>By a most singular coincidence, when only two out of twenty states
                                had gold for a standard, your conference decided upon it for the
                                standard, with silver as a transitory <pb n="250" xml:id="pg_250"
                                    facs="0284"/>companion; and this was done because the double
                                standard was necessary in certain states that were used to it, or
                                where silver was the exclusive standard.</p>
                            <p>This valuable unanimity on a question so important, tending to
                                perfect the monetary system of the convention of 1865, will
                                certainly influence public opinion, and certain men in the interior
                                of states who may have retained any doubt on the question.</p>
                            <p>In thus adopting gold as a basis for the desired union, it was only
                                in a common denominator above the franc that it was possible to
                                realize the useful equations and frequent coincidences in the
                                systems to be brought together; for, in gold coins, the very minute
                                differences could not be distinguished with precision by the process
                                of coinage, and already the mere distance of five francs may be
                                sometimes difficult to express sufficiently in the external form of
                                the monetary disks.</p>
                            <p>The weight of five francs in gold of nine-tenths fineness, the
                                standard which was unanimously approved, and also one of the
                                conditions of the convention of 1865, then appeared to be the proper
                                denominator for the basis of the desired assimilation between the
                                monetary systems of the twenty states represented.</p>
                            <p>You are aware that the coins of the union of 1865 are already grouped
                                around this denominator.</p>
                            <p>For example, it was shown how near the type of twenty-five francs
                                came to the pound sterling, the half-eagle of five dollars, and a
                                piece adopted by the Vienna conference to represent the value of ten
                                florins. This type of twenty-five francs, especially recommended in
                                the conference by the representatives of Austria and of the United
                                States, has been unanimously accepted by the states that voted in
                                the discussion of question nine, but on optional conditions.</p>
                            <p>Your opinions were more divided, in fact equally, in regard to the
                                utility of recommending at present a gold piece of fifteen francs,
                                the approximate equation of seven florins of the Netherlands and
                                South Germany, and of four thalers of North Germany. But, without
                                recommending this type, as you did that of twenty-five francs, you
                                nevertheless agreed that, if circumstances rendered it proper, it
                                would be open to no serious objection in itself, unless it might be
                                in the delicacy of the process for coining it distinctly.</p>
                            <p>The eventual extension of the types of gold coins would necessitate,
                                    <hi rend="italic">a fortiori,</hi> for the states that desired
                                it, correlative latitude in the forms of their silver coins, the
                                internationality of which is of less importance.</p>
                            <p>Such, gentlemen, are the simple but instructive and plain bases that
                                you have thought proper to accept as a sort of siege to the citadel
                                of monetary diversity, the fall of which you would like to behold,
                                or, at least, to gradually destroy its walls, for the benefit of the
                                daily increasing commerce and exchanges of every description among
                                the different members of the human family.</p>
                            <p>The desire of not detaining you longer, gentlemen, after a session of
                                three weeks, is my apology for the imperfection of this hastily
                                written digest, which is made in the hope that some decision may be
                                reached by the middle of February, 1868, or at least some
                                instructive steps taken by the governments that have sent you to
                                this conference.</p>
                            <p>If the germs of our collective, enlightened, and benevolent
                                aspirations, freed from the unpleasant compensations that sometimes
                                attend the most seductive reforms, in which we are all animated by
                                the true spirit of civilization and modern progress, shall come to
                                fructify around you, I hope, gentlemen, you will pleasurably recall
                                the honorable memories of the part you have taken in these delicate
                                scientific discussions, with the satisfaction of their joint
                                pursuit, under a presidency so memorable, and with a facility and
                                harmony as perfect as that of delegates from a single nation in its
                                ordinary deliberations.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> Your No. 199, on the reform of the coinage
                            of the world, was received on the 28th of June, and was immediately
                            communicated to the governments of Prussia and of North Germany. I have
                            received in reply the communication which I inclose. The Diet of North
                            Germany, at its last session, directed inquiries to be made to establish
                            a uniformity of coinage and currency for North Germany. The customs
                            parliament went further and requested that the inquiry might extend to
                            all the States included in the customs union. Good results may be hoped
                            for from these inquiries, because the policy of North Germany requires
                            uniformity in the coinage for all the States; and if the States of South
                            Germany join in the inquiry, it must lead either to no action or to a
                            most thorough reform. The tendency here is strong toward the adoption of
                            the five and twenty-franc gold piece, with decimal divisions; but
                            nothing is decided.</p>
                        <p>Your dispatches to No. 202 have been received.</p>

                            <p>The efforts to reform the coinage in Germany are designed: 1. To
                                introduce a uniform national system of coinage with decimal
                                divisions. 2. To introduce circulable gold coins, and that either
                                    (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) by the adoption of a simple gold
                                coinage, in such a manner that silver money shall be coined <hi
                                    rend="italic">above</hi> its value; or (<hi rend="italic"
                                >b</hi>) by the introduction of a so-called double coinage, with an
                                unchanging ratio of value between gold and silver, such as exists in
                                France; or (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) by adopting the double coinage
                                only as a transition to a pure gold coinage, with a ratio of value
                                either of 15½ to 1, or of 15.55 to 1, or of 15¾ to 1, between gold
                                and silver. 3. To bring the coinage unit of Germany into a simple
                                ratio or relation to the coinage unit of other countries, and that
                                either (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) by a simple adoption of the French
                                franc system; or (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) by the introduction of a
                                gold coin of the <pb n="252" xml:id="pg_252" facs="0286"/>value of
                                25 francs as a basis, with decimal divisions, so that a unit of
                                reckoning may be reached, viz., (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>,) the gold
                                thaler, at 5 francs; or (<hi rend="italic">ß</hi>) the gold florin,
                                at two-thirds of a thaler; or (<hi rend="italic">?</hi>) the mark,
                                at one-third of a thaler; (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>,) by the
                                introduction of the gold crown, as being a coin which is akin to the
                                metrical system of weights, and therefore suited to be the basis of
                                an international system; also, by a decimal division of the same, so
                                that the gold thaler = one-tenth of a crown = about 28
                                silver-grosehen, may form the unit of reckoning, and one
                                one-hundreth of a gold thaler may form as a kreutzer, the smallest
                                unit belonging to the decimal system.</p>
                            <p>The following questions now arise:</p>
                            <p>I. In arranging the system of coinage, shall the silver coinage alone
                                be retained?</p>
                            <p>An affirmative answer to this question would greatly facilitate the
                                establishment of a uniform coinage in Germany, but would necessitate
                                a, renunciation (1) of the introduction of a legal gold currency;
                                (2,) of the establishment of a simple relation between the German
                                system of coinage and that of those nations which have a gold
                                coinage or the so-called double coinage.</p>
                            <p>It must, therefore, be determined (1) whether the retention of the
                                simple silver coinage would be attended with such great advantages
                                that the introduction of a legal gold currency would be advisable;
                                (2,) whether the establishment of a simple relation of the German
                                standard to that of the countries having a gold or double coinage
                                would be attended with such advantages that, in the arrangement of
                                the system of coinage, the establishment of such a relation would be
                                indispensable.</p>
                            <p>But these advantages and disadvantages must be considered from the
                                standpoint of internal and international trade.</p>
                            <p>II. Should a simple gold coinage be at once introduced?</p>
                            <p>In relation to this question two things must be considered: 1. The
                                advantages of a gold coinage over a simple silver coinage, (already
                                considered under I,) and over, the so-called double coinage. 2. The
                                difficulties and expense of the change.</p>
                            <p>With regard to 1, the following questions arise: (<hi rend="italic"
                                    >a</hi>.) Which offers greater guarantees, a gold coinage or a
                                double coinage, that the price of the circulating media will not be
                                liable to sudden and great fluctuations? (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>.)
                                Which will give rise to greater confusion, a simple gold currency or
                                the double currency, when the relation of the respective market
                                values of the two precious metals becomes changed? (<hi
                                    rend="italic">c</hi>.) Which offers greater convenience, a
                                simple gold coinage or a double coinage, for internal and
                                international payments?</p>
                            <p>With regard to 2, the following questions arise: (<hi rend="italic"
                                    >a.</hi>) What would probably be the price of gold if the gold
                                necessary for this change had to be purchased? (<hi rend="italic"
                                    >b</hi>.) At what price would the silver money now in
                                circulation have to be purchased, payment being made in the new gold
                                currency, in order to avoid the disastrous consequences of a sudden
                                diminution in the value of the. circulating medium? (<hi
                                    rend="italic">c</hi>.) What relation of value between gold and
                                silver would it be proper to place as the basis for a change of
                                existing obligations payable in silver to obligations payable in
                                gold? Or (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) would it be better to make no
                                such legal change, and to leave the conversion simply to private
                                agreement? (<hi rend="italic">e</hi>.) What precautions ought the
                                state to take, in the event of a legal conversion of existing
                                obligations, in order to obviate the danger of a general repudiation
                                of existing obligations? (<hi rend="italic">f</hi>.) To what extent
                                could the exchanged silver currency be used in making new silver
                                coins, and how high a coinage tax might be laid thereupon? (Here it
                                should be considered for how high amounts payment in gold should be
                                made obligatory.) (<hi rend="italic">g</hi>.) At what price would
                                the silver that could not be used probably have to be sold? (<hi
                                    rend="italic">h</hi>.) How great would the expense of the change
                                be to the state?</p>
                            <p>III. Is a change to a double coinage advisable?</p>
                            <p>With regard to this question, there is no need to consider whether a
                                double coinage is to be regarded as the ultimate object of a reform
                                in the coinage, since, even if it should now be regarded as the
                                ultimate object, a change to a simple gold coinage would still
                                remain feasible.</p>
                            <p>As reasons for a double coinage, the following are adduced: 1. The
                                possibility of going on gradually with the preparation of the
                                necessary gold coins, and of thereby diminishing the expense of the
                                reform. 2. The possibility of using the silver coins hitherto in use
                                in the new. system. 3. The possibility of an accurate conversion of
                                existing obligations into obligations according to the new system,
                                since such conversion would not be so far removed from the silver
                                values, in which the obligations are payable. 4. The possibility of
                                such an assimilation to the Frenceh system that, by a retention of
                                the two systems of double coinage contemporaneously, a revolution in
                                the market price of the precious metals would be avoided.</p>
                            <p>With regard to these points, it has been proposed to adopt the
                                unchanging ratio now existing in France between gold and silver,
                                taking the florin as a standard.</p>
                            <p>According to this, 1 florin = 2/3 of the thalers hitherto in use = 2½
                                francs, the unit of reckoning. One 25-franc piece = 10 florins = 6
                                2/3 of the thalers now in use, the chief gold com. The florin being
                                divided into 100 kreutzers, the 1/6-thaler piece = 25 kreutzers, <pb
                                    n="253" xml:id="pg_253" facs="0287"/>the 1/12-thaler piece = 12½
                                kreutzers, the 1/30 -thaler piece = 5 kreutzers. The 25-franc piece
                                would have to contain 7.25 grammes of line gold.</p>
                            <p>According to the French relation of value of 1:15½, 10 florins, which
                                = 6 2/3 thalers, would have to contain 15½ ×7.25 grammes = 112.375
                                grammes of fine silver. But 6 2/3 thalers contain only 111.111
                                grammes of flue silver, and therefore 1.264 grammes less.</p>
                            <p>If, therefore, in the conversion of obligations, 1 thaler of the
                                present coinage shall be converted into 1½ florin of the new, the
                                debtors would become indebted 1¼ per cent, more in silver, while the
                                creditors would gain 1¼ per cent, in silver. It must therefore be
                                asked: Is it allowable to ignore this difference, and that (<hi
                                    rend="italic">a</hi>) in all claims for debt, (including state
                                taxes, salaries, &amp;c.,) or (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) in claims
                                for debt to a certain amount, and to what amount?</p>
                            <p>If this question is answered in the negative, it is to be asked: Is a
                                system to be recommended whose unit of reckoning in the conversion
                                of existing obligations stands to the analogous unit of the present
                                system (1 Austrian florin) as 101¼ to 100?</p>
                            <p>Precisely the same questions would arise if, instead of the florin,
                                we should undertake to make the franc, or a multiple thereof, (5
                                francs,) the unit of reckoning. With regard to these propositions,
                                the advantages of the franc or florin system would have to be
                                considered (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) with respect to the value of
                                the <hi rend="italic">Rechnungsmünze</hi> or money of account, [<hi
                                    rend="italic">i.</hi>
                                <hi rend="italic">e</hi>., imaginary coin, such as the pound
                                sterling of England;] (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) with respect to the
                                advantages or disadvantages of conformity of the small gold, silver,
                                and copper coins, as well as of the various denominations of
                                banknotes and paper money with those of the nations using the franc
                                system.</p>
                            <p>A second system has for its basis the gold crown, which would be
                                divisible into 100 thalers, at 100 kreutzers each.</p>
                            <p>According to the relation of gold to silver = 15.5: 1, this new
                                thaler would contain 10x15.5/10=15.5 grammes of silver, and
                                therefore, since the thaler now in use contains 500/30=16.666
                                grammes of fine silver, it (<hi rend="italic">i.</hi>
                                <hi rend="italic">e</hi>., the new thaler) would be equal to
                                15.5/16.666=0.93 thaler = 27.9 silver-groschen.</p>
                            <p>As this ratio is an inconvenient one, it is proposed to let the ratio
                                between gold and silver be as 15.55 is to 1, according to which the
                                new thaler would equal 0.933 of the thaler now in use, or 28
                                silver-groschen; the kreutzer would = 3.36 pence = 98/100 South
                                German kreutzers.</p>
                            <p>It is a question whether, in making a change, the ratio of 14 to 15
                                is a favorable one, and whether this system is calculated, through
                                the cooperation of other nations, to become an international one,
                                and whether, through this establishment of the reciprocal value of
                                the precious metals, sufficient remittances of gold would be made to
                                our market, or whether it would be more advisable to let the ratio
                                between the two be as 15.75 is to 1.</p>
                            <p>Finally, it is proposed to take but one step, viz., to give the gold
                                crown a fixed value of 9 thalers 10 silver-groschen, and to leave
                                further developments to the future.</p>
                            <p>It may be questioned whether a satisfactory gold coinage may be thus
                                reached, and a sufficient gold currency created, and whether, for
                                the sake of this convenience, it would be well to renounce the other
                                advantages to be obtained by a reform in the coinage.</p>

                            Spanish-American countries, are herewith transmitted. With a view to
                            enable the President more fully to comply with the request for

                            to the improvement of those relations, you will, without unnecessary
                            delay, communicate to this Department any facts, and will make any
                            suggestions which you may deem useful.</p>

                            <p>The Secretary of State, to whom was referred the resolution of the
                                Senate requesting the President “to institute an inquiry, by such
                                means as in his judgment shall be deemed proper, into the present
                                condition of the commercial relations between the United States and
                                the Spanish-American states on this continent, and between those
                                countries and other nations, and to communicate to the Senate full
                                and complete statements regarding the same, together with such
                                recommendations as he may think necessary to promote the development
                                and increase of our commerce with those regions, and to secure to
                                the United States that proportionate share of the trade of this
                                continent to which their close relations of geographical contiguity
                                and political friendship with all the states of America justly
                                entitle them,” has the honor to report:</p>
                            <p>The resolution justly regards the commercial and the political
                                relations of the United States with the American states of Spanish
                                origin as necessarily dependent upon each other. If the commerce of
                                those countries has been diverted from its natural connection with
                                the United States, the fact may probably be partly traced to
                                political causes, which have been swept away by the great civil
                                convulsion in this country.</p>
                            <p>For the just comprehension of the position of this Government in the
                                American political system, and for the causes which have failed to
                                give it hitherto the influence to which it is properly entitled, by
                                reason of its democratic system, and of the moderation and sense of
                                justice which have distinguished its foreign policy through
                                successive administrations from the birth of the nation until now,
                                it is necessary to make a brief notice of such measures as affect
                                our present relations to the other parts of this continent.</p>
                            <p>The United States were the first of the European colonies in America
                                to arrive at maturity as a people, and assume the position of an
                                independent republic. Since then important changes have taken place
                                in various nations and in every part of the world. Our own growth in
                                power has been not the least remarkable of all the great events of
                                modern history.</p>
                            <pb n="255" xml:id="pg_255" facs="0289"/>
                            <p>When, at the conclusion of the revolutionary war, having conquered by
                                arms our right to exist as a sovereign state, that right was at
                                length recognized by treaties, we occupied only a narrow belt of
                                land along the Atlantic coast, hemmed in at the north, the west, and
                                the south by the possessions of European governments, or by
                                uncultivated wastes beyond the Alleghanies, inhabited only by the
                                aborigines. But, in the very infancy of the United States,
                                far-sighted statesmen saw and predicted that, weak in population and
                                apparently restricted in available territory as the new republic
                                then was, it had within it the germs of colossal grandeur, and
                                would, at no remote day, occupy the continent of America with its
                                institutions, its authority, and its peaceful influence.</p>
                            <p>That expectation has been thus far signally verified. The United
                                States entered at once into the occupation of their rightful
                                possessions westward to the banks of the Mississippi. Next, by the
                                spontaneous proffer of France, they acquired Louisiana and its
                                territorial extension, or right of extension, north to the line of
                                the treaty demarkation between France and Great Britain, and west to
                                the Pacific Ocean. Next, by amicable arrangement with Spain, they
                                acquired the Floridas, and complete southern maritime frontiers upon
                                the Gulf of Mexico. Then came the union with the independent State
                                of Texas, followed by the acquisitions of California and New Mexico,
                                and then of Arizona. Finally, Russia has ceded to us Alaska, and the
                                continent of North America has become independent of Europe, except
                                so much of it as continues to maintain political relations with
                                Great Britain.</p>
                            <p>Meanwhile, partly by natural increase, and partly by voluntary
                                immigration from Europe, our population has risen from three
                                millions to nearly forty millions; the number of States and
                                Territories united under the Constitution has been augmented from
                                thirteen to forty-seven; the development of internal wealth and
                                power has kept pace with political expansion; we have occupied in
                                part and peopled the vast interior of the continent; we have bound
                                the Pacific to the Atlantic by a chain of intervening States and
                                organized Territories; we have delivered the republic from the
                                anomaly and the ignominy of domestic servitude; we have
                                constitutionally fixed the equality of all races and of all men
                                before the law; and we have established, at the cost of a great
                                civil war—a cost, however, not beyond the value of such a result—the
                                indissoluble national unity of the United States.</p>
                            <p>In all these marked stages of national progress, from the Declaration
                                of Independence to the recent amendments of the Constitution, it is
                                impossible not to perceive a providential series and succession of
                                events, intimately attached, one to the other, and possessed of
                                definite character as a whole, whatever incidental departures from
                                such uniformity may have marked or seemed to mark our foreign policy
                                under the influence of temporary causes, or of the conflicting
                                opinions of statesmen.</p>
                            <p>In the time of Washington, of the first Adams, of Jefferson, and of
                                Madison, the condition of Europe, engaged in the gigantic wars of
                                the French revolution and of the empire, produced its series of
                                public questions, and gave tone and color to our foreign policy. In
                                the time of Monroe, of the second Adams, and of Jackson, and
                                subsequently thereto, the independence of the Spanish and Portuguese
                                colonies of America produced its series of questions and its
                                apparent modification of our public policy. Domestic questions of
                                territorial organization, of social emancipation, and of national
                                unity have also largely occupied the minds and the attention of the
                                later administrations.</p>
                            <p>The treaties of alliance and guarantee with France which contributed
                                so much to our independence, were one source of solicitude to the
                                early administrations, which were endeavoring to protect our
                                commerce from the depredations and wrongs to which the maritime
                                policy of England and the. reaction of that policy on France
                                subjected it. For twenty years we struggled in vain to accomplish
                                this, and at last drifted into war.</p>
                            <p>The avoidance of entangling alliances, the characteristic feature of
                                the foreign policy of Washington, sprang from this condition of
                                things. But the entangling alliances which then existed were
                                engagements made with France as a part of the general contract under
                                which aid was furnished to us for the achievement of our
                                independence. France was willing to waive the letter of the
                                obligation as to her West India possessions, but demanded, in its
                                stead, privileges in our ports which the administration was
                                unwilling to concede. To make its refusal acceptable to a public
                                which sympathized with France, the cabinet of General Washington
                                exaggerated the principle into a theory tending to national
                                isolation.</p>
                            <p>The public measures designed to maintain unimpaired the domestic
                                sovereignty and the international neutrality of the United States
                                were independent of this policy, though apparently incidental to it.
                                The municipal laws enacted by Congress then and since have been but
                                declarations of the law of nations. They are essential to the
                                preservation of our national dignity and honor; they have for their
                                object to repress and punish all enterprises of private war, one of
                                the last relics of mediaeval barbarism; and they have descended to
                                us from the fathers of the republic, supported and enforced by every
                                succeeding President of the United States.</p>
                            <p>The foreign policy of these early days was not a narrow one. During
                                this period we secured the evacuation by Great Britain of the
                                country wrongfully occupied by her <pb n="256" xml:id="pg_256"
                                    facs="0290"/>on the lakes; we acquired Louisiana; we measured
                                forces on the sea with France, and on the land and sea with England;
                                we set the example of resisting and chastising the piracies of the
                                Barbary States; we initiated in negotiations with Prussia the long
                                line of treaties for the liberalization of war and the promotion of
                                international intercourse; and we steadily demanded, and at length
                                obtained, indemnification from various governments for the losses we
                                had suffered by foreign spoliations in the wars of Europe.</p>
                            <p>To this point in our foreign policy we had arrived when the
                                revolutionary movements in Spanish and Portuguese America compelled
                                a modification of our relations with Europe, in consequence of the
                                rise of new and independent States in America.</p>
                            <p>The revolution which commenced in 1810, and extended through all the
                                Spanish American continental colonies, after vain efforts of
                                repression on the part of Spain, protracted through twenty years,
                                terminated in the establishment of the independent States of Mexico,
                                Guatemala, San Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Venezuela,
                                Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Chili, Bolivia, the Argentine Republic,
                                Uruguay, and Paraguay, to which the empire of Brazil came in time to
                                be added. These events necessarily enlarged the sphere of action of
                                the United States, and essentially modified our relations with
                                Europe, and our attitude to the rest of this continent.</p>
                            <p>The new States were, like ourselves, revolted colonies. They
                                continued the precedent we had set, of separating from Europe. Their
                                assumption of independence was stimulated by our example. They
                                professedly imitated us, and copied our national Constitution,
                                sometimes even to their inconvenience.</p>
                            <p>The Spanish-American colonies had not the same preparation for
                                independence that we had. Each of the British colonies possessed
                                complete local autonomy. Its formal transition from dependence to
                                independence consisted chiefly in expelling the British governor of
                                the colony, and electing a governor of the State, from which to the
                                organized Union was but a step. All these conditions of success were
                                wanting in Spanish America, and hence many of the difficulties in
                                their career as independent States; and, further, while the
                                revolution in British America was the exclusive result of the march
                                of opinion in the British colonies, the simultaneous action of the
                                separate Spanish colonies, though showing a desire for independence,
                                was principally produced by the accident of the invasion of Spain by
                                France.</p>
                            <p>The formation of these new sovereignties in America was important to
                                us, not only because of the cessation of colonial monopolies to that
                                extent, but because of the geographical relations to us, held by so
                                many new nations, all, like ourselves, created from European stock,
                                and interested in excluding European politics, dynastic questions,
                                and balances of power from further influence in the New World.</p>
                            <p>Thus the United States were forced into new lines of action, which,
                                though apparently in some respects conflicting, were really in
                                harmony with the line marked out by Washington. The avoidance of
                                entangling political alliances, and the maintenance of our own
                                independent neutrality became doubly important from the fact that
                                they became applicable to the new republics as well as to the mother
                                country. The duty of non-interference had been admitted by every
                                President. The question came up in the time of the first Adams, on
                                the occasion of the enlistment projects of Miranda. It appeared
                                again under Jefferson (anterior to the revolt of the Spanish
                                colonies) in the schemes of Aaron Burr. It was an ever-present
                                question in the administrations of Madison, Monroe, and the younger
                                Adams, in reference to the questions of foreign enlistment or
                                equipment in the United States, and when these new republics entered
                                the family of nations, many of them very feeble, and all too much
                                subject to internal revolution and civil war, a strict adherence to
                                our previous policy and a strict enforcement of our laws became
                                essential to the preservation of friendly relations with them; for,
                                since that time, it has been one of the principal cares of those
                                intrusted with the administration of the Government, to prevent
                                piratical expeditions against these sister republics from leaving
                                our ports. And thus the changed condition of the New World made no
                                change in the traditional and peaceful policy of the United States
                                in this respect.</p>
                            <p>In one respect, however, the advent of these new States in America
                                did compel an apparent change of foreign policy on our part. It
                                devolved upon us the determination of the great international
                                question, at what time, and under what circumstances, to recognize a
                                new power as entitled to a place among the family of nations. There
                                was but little of precedent to guide us, except our own case.
                                Something, indeed, could be inferred from the historical origin of
                                the Netherlands and Switzerland. But our own case, carefully and
                                conscientiously considered, was sufficient to guide us to right
                                conclusions. We maintained our position of international friendship
                                and of treaty obligations toward Spain, but we did not consider that
                                we were bound to wait for its recognition of the new republics
                                before admitting them into treaty relations with us as sovereign
                                States. We held that it was for us to judge whether or not they had
                                attained to the condition of actual independence, and the consequent
                                right of recognition by us. We considered this question of fact
                                deliberately and coolly. We sent commissioners to Spanish America to
                                ascertain and report for our information concerning their actual
                                circumstances, and in the fullness of time we acknowledged their
                                independence <pb n="257" xml:id="pg_257" facs="0291"/>we exchanged
                                diplomatic ministers, and made treaties of amity with them, the
                                earliest of which, negotiated by Mr. John Quincy Adams, served as
                                the model for the subsequent treaties with the Spanish-American
                                republics. We also, simultaneously therewith, exerted our good
                                offices with Spain, to induce her to submit to the inevitable
                                result, and herself to accept and acknowledge the independence of
                                her late colonies. We endeavored to induce Russia to join us in
                                these representations. In all this our action was positive, in the
                                direction of promoting the complete political separation of America
                                from Europe.</p>
                            <p>A vast field was thus opened to the statesmen of the United States
                                for the peaceful introduction, the spread, and the permanent
                                establishment of the American ideas of republican government, of
                                modification of the laws of war, of liberalization of commerce, of
                                religious freedom and toleration, and of the emancipation of the New
                                World from the dynastic and balance of power controversies of
                                Europe.</p>
                            <p>Mr. John Quincy Adams, beyond any other statesmen of the time in this
                                country, had the knowledge and experience, both European and
                                American, the comprehension of thought and purpose, and the moral
                                convictions which peculiarly fitted him to introduce our country
                                into this new field, and to lay the foundation of an American
                                policy. The declaration known as the Monroe doctrine, and the
                                objects and purposes of the congress of Panama, both supposed to
                                have been largely inspired by Mr. Adams, have influenced public
                                events from that day to this, as a principle of government for this
                                continent and its adjacent islands.</p>
                            <p>It was at the period of the congress of Aix-la-Chapelle and of
                                Laybach, when the “holy alliance” was combined to arrest all
                                political changes in Europe in the sense of liberty, when they were
                                intervening in Southern Europe for the reëstablishment of
                                absolutism, and when they were meditating interference to check the
                                progress of free government in America, that Mr. Monroe, in his
                                annual message in December 1823, declared that the United States
                                would consider any attempt to extend the European system to any
                                portion of this hemisphere as dangerous to our peace and safety.
                                “With the existing colonies or dependencies of any European power,”
                                he said, “we have not interfered and shall not interfere. But with
                                the governments who have declared their independence, and maintained
                                it, and whose independence we have on great consideration and on
                                just principles acknowledged, we could not view any interposition
                                for the purpose of oppressing them, or controlling, in any other
                                manner, their destiny, by any European power, in any other light
                                than as the manifestation of an unfriendly feeling toward the United
                                States.”</p>
                            <p>This declaration resolved the solution of the immediate question of
                                the independence of the Spanish-American colonies, and is supposed
                                to have exercised some influence upon the course of the British
                                cabinet in regard to the absolutist schemes in Europe as well as in
                                America.</p>
                            <p>It has also exercised a permanent influence on this continent. It was
                                at once invoked in consequence of the supposed peril of Cuba on the
                                side of Europe; it was applied to a similar danger threatened
                                Yucatan; it was embodied in the treaty of the United States and
                                Great Britain as to Central America; it produced the successful
                                opposition of the United States to the attempt of Great Britain to
                                exercise dominion in Nicaragua under the cover of the Mosquito
                                Indians; and it operated in like manner to prevent the establishment
                                of a European dynasty in Mexico.</p>
                            <p>The United States stand solemnly committed by repeated declarations
                                and repeated acts to this doctrine, and its application to the
                                affairs of this continent. In his message to the two Houses of
                                Congress at the commencement of the present session, the President,
                                following the teachings of all our history, said that the existing
                                “dependencies are no longer regarded as subject to transfer from one
                                European power to another. When the present relation of colonies
                                ceases, they are to become independent powers, exercising the right
                                of choice and of self-control in the determination of their future
                                condition and relations with other powers.”</p>
                            <p>This policy is not a policy of aggression; but it opposes the
                                creation of European dominion on American soil, or its transfer to
                                other European powers, and it looks hopefully to the time when, by
                                the voluntary departure of European governments from this continent
                                and the adjacent islands, America shall be wholly American.</p>
                            <p>It does not contemplate forcible intervention in any legitimate
                                contest; but it protests against permitting such a contest to result
                                in the increase of European power or influence; and it ever impels
                                this Government, as in the late contest between the South American
                                republics and Spain, to interpose its good offices to secure an
                                honorable peace.</p>
                            <p>The congress of Panama was planned by Bolivar to secure the union of
                                Spanish America against Spain. It had originally military as well as
                                political purposes. In the military objects the United States could
                                take no part; and indeed the necessity for such objects ceased when
                                the full effects of Mr. Monroe’s declarations were felt. But the
                                pacific objects of the congress, the establishment of close and
                                cordial relations of amity, the creation of commercial intercourse,
                                of interchange of political thought, and of habits of good
                                understanding between the new republics and the United States and
                                    <pb n="258" xml:id="pg_258" facs="0292"/>their respective
                                citizens, might perhaps have been attained had the administration of
                                that day received the united support of the country. Unhappily they
                                were lost; the new states were removed from the sympathetic and
                                protecting influence of our example, and their commerce, which we
                                might then have secured, passed into other hands, unfriendly to the
                                United States.</p>
                            <p>In looking back upon the Panama congress from this length of time, it
                                is easy to understand why the earnest and patriotic men who
                                endeavored to crystallize an American system for this continent
                                failed.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Clay and Mr. Adams were far-sighted statesmen, but unfortunately
                                they struck against the rock of African slavery. One of the
                                questions proposed for discussion in the conference was, “The
                                consideration of the means to be adopted for the entire abolition of
                                the African slave trade,” to which proposition the committee of the
                                United States Senate of that day replied, “The United States have
                                not certainly the right, and ought never to feel the inclination, to
                                dictate to others who may differ with them upon this subject, nor do
                                the committee see the expediency of insulting other states with whom
                                we are maintaining relations of perfect amity, by ascending the
                                moral chair, and proclaiming from thence mere abstract principles,
                                of the rectitude of which each nation enjoys the perfect right of
                                deciding for itself.” The same committee also alluded to the
                                possibility that the condition of the islands of Cuba and Porto
                                Rico, still the possessions of Spain, and still slaveholding, might
                                be made the subject of discussion and of contemplated action by the
                                Panama congress. “If ever the United States [they said] permit
                                themselves to be associated with these nations in any general
                                congress assembled for the discussion of common plans in any way
                                affecting European interests, they will, by such act, not only
                                deprive themselves of the ability they now possess of rendering
                                useful assistance to the other American states, but also produce
                                other effects prejudicial to their own interests.”</p>
                            <p>Thus the necessity at that day of preserving the great interest of
                                the Southern States in African slavery, and of preventing a change
                                in the character of labor in the islands of Cuba and Porto Rico,
                                lost to the United States the opportunity of giving a permanent
                                direction to the political and commercial connections of the newly
                                enfranchised Spanish-American states, and their trade passed into
                                hands unfriendly to the United States, and has remained there ever
                                since.</p>
                            <p>Events, subsequent to that date, have tended to place us in a
                                position to retrieve our mistakes; among which events may be
                                particularly named the suppression of the rebellion, the
                                manifestation of our undeveloped and unexpected military power, the
                                retirement of the French from Mexico, and the abolition of slavery
                                in the United States.</p>
                            <p>There is good reason to believe that the latter fact has bad an
                                important influence in our favor in Spanish America. It has caused
                                us to be regarded there with more sympathetic as well as more
                                respectful consideration; it has relieved those republics from the
                                fear of filibusterism, which had been formerly incited against
                                Central America and Mexico in the interest of slave extension; and
                                it has produced an impression of the stability of our institutions
                                and of our public strength sufficient to dissipate the fears of our
                                friends or the hopes of those who wish us ill.</p>
                            <p>Thus there exists in the Spanish-American republics confidence toward
                                the United States. On our side they find a feeling of cordial amity
                                and friendship, and a desire to cultivate and develop our common
                                interests on this continent. With some of these states our relations
                                are more intimate than with others, either by reason of closer
                                similarity of constitutional forms, of greater commercial
                                intercourse, of proximity in fact, or of the construction or
                                contemplated construction of lines of transit for our trade and
                                commerce between the Atlantic and the Pacific. With several of them
                                we have peculiar treaty relations. The treaty of 1846 between the
                                United States and New Granada contains stipulations of guarantee for
                                the neutrality of that part of the Isthmus within the present
                                territory of Colombia, and for the protection of the rights of
                                sovereignty and property therein belonging to Colombia. Similar
                                stipulations appear in the treaty of 1867 with Nicaragua, and of
                                July 1864 with Honduras. Those treaties (like the treaty of alliance
                                made with France in 1778 by Dr. Franklin, Silas Deane, and Arthur
                                Lee) constitute <hi rend="italic">pro tanto</hi> a true protective
                                alliance between the United States and each of those republics.
                                Provisions of like effect appear in the treaty of April 19, 1850,
                                between Great Britain and the United States.</p>
                            <p>Brazil, with her imperial semblance and constitutional reality, has
                                always held relations of amity with us, which have been fortified by
                                the opening of her great rivers to commerce. It needs only that, in
                                emulation of Russia and the United States, she should emancipate her
                                slaves to place her in more complete sympathy with the rest of
                                America.</p>
                            <p>It will not be presumptions after the foregoing sketch to say, with
                                entire consideration for the sovereignty and national pride of the
                                Spanish-American republics, that the United States, by the priority
                                of their independence, by the stability of their institutions, by
                                the regard of their people for the forms of law, by their resources
                                as a government, by their naval power, by their commercial
                                enterprise, by the attractions <pb n="259" xml:id="pg_259"
                                    facs="0293"/>which they offer to European immigration, by the
                                prodigious internal development of their resources and wealth, and
                                by the intellectual life of their population, occupy of necessity a
                                prominent position on this continent, which they neither can nor
                                should abdicate, which entitles them to a leading voice, and which
                                imposes upon them duties of right and of honor regarding American
                                questions, whether those questions affect emancipated colonies, or
                                colonies still subject to European dominion.</p>
                            <p>The public questions which existed as to all European colonies, prior
                                to and during the revolutions in the continental colonies of Spain
                                and Portugal, still exist with reference to the European colonies
                                which remain, and they now return upon us in full force as we watch
                                events in Cuba and Porto Rico.</p>
                            <p>Whatever may be the result of the pending contest in Cuba, it appears
                                to be the belief of some of the leading statesmen of Spain, that the
                                relations which now exist between the island and the mother country
                                cannot be long continued. It is understood that the resources for
                                carrying on the struggle have been supplied mainly from Cuba, by the
                                aid of that portion of the population which does not desire to see
                                its political destinies intrusted to the persons who direct the
                                movements of the insurgents; but it does not follow that its
                                political relations with Spain are to remain unchanged, or that even
                                the party which is now dominant in the island will wish to forever
                                continue colonists.</p>
                            <p>These facts give reason to think that, when the contest shall close,
                                Cuba, with her resources strained, but unexhausted, (whatever may be
                                her political relations,) will resume and continue her old
                                commercial relations with the United States; and it is not
                                impossible that, at some day not far distant when measured by the
                                course of history, she will be called upon to elect her position in
                                the family of nations.</p>
                            <p>Although the resolution of the Senate does not in terms apply to the
                                Islands of the Antilles, it is impossible to answer it without
                                speaking of them. They outlie the southern coast of the United
                                States, and guard the approaches to the ports of Mexico, Venezuela,
                                and the Isthmus, by which we reach from the east the western coasts
                                of Mexico and of the Spanish states. The people of the Spanish
                                islands speak the language and share the traditions, customs, ideas,
                                and religion of the Spanish-American states of the continent, and
                                will probably, like them, become, at some time, independent of the
                                mother country. It would, therefore, be unwise, while shaping a
                                commercial policy for the continent, to disregard the islands which
                                lie so much nearer to our seaports.</p>
                            <p>With the Spanish islands of Cuba and Porto Rico we maintain, in spite
                                of their adverse legislation, a large commerce by reason of our
                                necessities and of their proximity. In the year ending June 30,
                                1869, we imported from them merchandise valued at $65,609,274.
                                During the same time we sent them goods to the value only of
                                $15,313,919.</p>
                            <p>The prohibitory duties forced upon them by the policy of Spain shut
                                out much that we might supply. Their tropical productions, for
                                instance, are too valuable to allow their lands to be given up to
                                the growth of breadstuffs; yet, instead of taking these articles
                                from the superabundant fields of their nearest neighbors, they are
                                forced to go to the distant plains of Spain. It will be for the
                                interest of the United States to shape its general policy so that
                                this relation of imports and exports shall be altered in Cuba when
                                peace is restored and its political condition is satisfactorily
                                established.</p>
                            <p>With none of the other Spanish-American states in North and South
                                America are our commercial relations what they should be. Our total
                                imports in the year ending June 30,1869, from these countries were
                                less than $25,000,000, (or not one-half the amount from Cuba alone,)
                                and our exports for the same time to them were only $17,850,313; and
                                yet these countries have an aggregate population nearly or quite as
                                great as that of the United States; they have republican forms of
                                government, and they profess to be, and probably really are, in
                                political sympathy with us.</p>
                            <p>This Department is not able to give with entire accuracy the imports
                                and exports of Great Britain with the same countries during the
                                corresponding period. It is believed, however, the following figures
                                will be found to be not far from correct:</p>
                            <p>Imports to Great Britain, $42,820,942; exports from Great Britain,
                                $40,682,102.</p>
                            <p>It thus appears that notwithstanding the greater distance which the
                                commerce has to travel in coming to and from Great Britain,
                                notwithstanding the political sympathy which ought naturally to
                                exist between republics, notwithstanding the American idea which has
                                been so prominently and so constantly put forward by the Government
                                of the United States, notwithstanding the acknowledged skill of
                                American manufactures, notwithstanding the ready markets which the
                                great cities of the United States afford for the consumption of
                                tropical productions, the inhabitants of the Spanish-American
                                continent consume of the products of Great Britain more than twice
                                the quantity they take of the products of the United States, and
                                that they sell to us only three-fifths of the amount they sell to
                                Great Britain.</p>
                            <p>The Secretary of State appends to this report the tables on which
                                these statements are founded. That their commerce with the United
                                States is not large, may be partially explained by the fact that
                                these states have been subject to many successive revolutions since
                                the failure of the congress of Panama. These revolutions not only
                                exhaust their resources and burden them with debt, but they check
                                emigration, prevent <pb n="260" xml:id="pg_260" facs="0294"/>the
                                flow of foreign capital into the country, and stop the enterprise
                                which needs a stable government for its development.</p>
                            <p>These suggestions are, however, applicable to the British commerce as
                                well as to our own, and they do not explain why we, with the natural
                                advantages in our favor, fall so far behind. The Isthmus of Panama
                                is the common point where the commerce of the western coasts of
                                Mexico and South America meets. When it arrives there, why should it
                                seek Liverpool and London rather than New York?</p>
                            <p>The political causes which have operated to divert this commerce from
                                us the Secretary of State has endeavored to explain. A favorable
                                time has now come for removing them—for laying the foundation of an
                                American policy which shall bind in closer union the American
                                republics. Let them understand that the United States do not covet
                                their territories; that our only desire is to see them peaceful,
                                with free and stable governments, increasing in wealth and
                                population, and developing in the lines in which their own
                                traditions, customs, habits, laws, and modes of thought will
                                naturally take them. Let them feel that, as in 1826 so now, this
                                government is ready to aid them to the full extent of its
                                constitutional power in any steps which they may take for their
                                better protection against anarchy. Let them be convinced that the
                                United States are prepared, in good faith and without ulterior
                                purposes, to join them in the development of a peaceful American
                                commercial policy, that may in time include this continent and the
                                West Indian Islands. Let this be comprehended, and there will be no
                                political reason why we may not “secure to the United States that
                                proportionate share of the trade of this continent to which their
                                close relations of geographical contiguity and political friendship
                                with all the states of America justly entitle them.”</p>
                            <p>It may not be enough to remove the political obstacles only. The
                                financial policy which the war made necessary may have operated
                                injuriously upon our commerce with these states. The resolution of
                                the Senate calls, on these points, for detailed information which is
                                not within the control of the Secretary of State, and for
                                recommendations for the future which he is not prepared to give
                                without that information. To fully answer the Senate’s call, it
                                would probably be necessary to employ some competent agent, familiar
                                with the Spanish-American states, to collate and arrange the
                                information asked for; for this there is no appropriation by
                                Congress.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> In reply to your circular dated
                            Washington, August 19, 1870, I would most respectfully ask leave to make
                            the following remarks:</p>
                        <p>Long before and ever since the independence of the Spanish-American
                            states, till by the acquisition of California by the United States, most
                            of the capital invested in the commerce of this country was of European
                            origin. This source of capital would naturally cause the streams of
                            commerce to flow in the direction of its supply. This trade was
                            unusually rich to its early founders and their successors. Our commerce
                            in those days was struggling for an existence, and sought the old and
                            well-beaten tracks with the Old World, content with sure but small
                            profits with all engaged in such trade. In the earlier days of the
                            existence of the Spanish-American republics, this country was almost a
                                <hi rend="italic">terra incognita</hi> to our merchant marine, and
                            the old established European houses were permitted but with little
                            competition to hold the control of this commerce in their own hands.
                            Although the people of this country have always expressed an ardent
                            admiration for our political institutions, and have imitated us in
                            constructing their fundamental laws, yet it cannot be denied that the
                            feeling of hatred and rivalry existing long-ago between the Latin and
                            Saxon races still holds sway in the minds of the masses of the present
                            populations of the Spanish-American states, the descendants of the old
                            Latin stock of the south of Europe. In our recent contest this old
                            leaven would crop out on all convenient occasions, and it is now easily
                            discernible in the great contest raging in Europe. This animus, no
                            doubt, has had a great deal to do in checking the growth of such
                            feelings on the part of those people as would promote a more cordial and
                            closer sympathy between us. I have no doubt of the truth of this
                            singular feature of the Spanish character as exhibited on this
                            continent. Even now, within my limited knowledge of the capitalists of
                            this country, at least a majority of all engaged in business in this
                            country are Europeans, or are intimately connected with European houses.
                            Of course, the products of this capital would seek their fountain-head
                            for consumption in manufactures, or in the needs and wants of consumers
                            at home. The exports from Colombia and the <pb n="262" xml:id="pg_262"
                                facs="0296"/>Central American states are as yet in their infancy.
                            The capacity of production at present is very limited, owing to the
                            great want of labor.</p>
                        <p>Emigration has never yet brought to these shores the brawny arm of the
                            stalwart laborer to take his place as an artisan or as the tiller of the
                            soil. The few that have come are lured by the brilliant and fascinating
                                <hi rend="italic">ignis fatuus</hi> of the gold and silver mines. In
                            this search after the hidden treasure hope soon becomes exhausted, and
                            they retire discouraged and disgusted with everything pertaining to this
                            country. Uncertain as the dependence upon native labor is, it is as yet
                            the only source of supply to those engaged in either agricultural or
                            manufacturing pursuits.</p>
                        <p>Nature has done so much for the inhabitants of the tropics as to preclude
                            all necessity for much effort on their part to enjoy a comfortable
                            existence. How long this state of things will exist can only be told in
                            the future. Agriculturists of this country are now looking to the
                            densely populated regions of China, and before long the experiment of an
                            importation of coolies will be tested.</p>
                        <p>The aggregate amount of the products of the countries bordering on the
                            Pacific Ocean, and which are now diverted from the United States, is
                            very great, and they must soon be vastly augmented if this Chinese
                            problem is successfully solved.</p>
                        <p>Intelligent minds agree, with wonderful unanimity, that the construction
                            of an interoceanic canal by and under the influence and control of the
                            United States will, more than all other causes combined, tend to bring
                            directly to our own harbors and docks the rich products which are now
                            taken from us in foreign bottoms. The bulk of the trade of most of the
                            products of the states south of Panama is now transported in foreign
                            bottoms through the Straits of Magellan to the markets of Europe. The
                            high tariff of tolls over the Panama Railroad, with the great resources
                            of the Pacific Steam Navigation Company, (a British company of unlimited
                            means,) has conduced to this state of things. A project is now
                            entertained, I believe, by this same company to extend their lines up
                            the coast as far as Guatemala, so as to reach the cotton, the coffee,
                            indigo, sugar, and other rich productions of that region. In connection
                            with this subject, I will mention a conversation I recently had with a
                            very intelligent person doing business in this isthmus; he said he had
                            it from undoubted authority that a secret arrangement had been made and
                            entered into between the Panama Railroad Company and the British Royal
                            Mail Packet Company, by which the railroad company agreed to withdraw
                            their line of brigs between New York and A spin wall, and to place a
                            fourth boat on their Central American line. By this line from Guatemala
                            to Southampton and London, they hope to be able to ship all products
                            from Central America directly to England, thus despoiling us of what we
                            are now receiving. The great fall in Panama Railroad stock is said to
                            have been caused by this new arrangement. Fourteen per cent, of their
                            usual annual dividend, with the sales of their lines of brigs, with
                            their new steamer Winchester, was said to be the amount invested as
                            their share in this new company.</p>
                        <p>When the sails of our merchant marine can pass from our ports
                            unobstructed on this isthmus, then may we expect our commerce with the
                            South American states, and also with those of Central America, to be
                            vastly increased; and then we will have the advantage of all other
                            nations in contending for the rich trade which wall then float upon the
                            broad surface of the Pacific Ocean, even to its most western
                            borders.</p>
                        <p>The citizens of the United States residing and doing business on this
                            coast have witnessed with much approbation the patriotic and national
                                <pb n="263" xml:id="pg_263" facs="0297"/>proposition of our worthy
                            and popular Chief Magistrate to the Congress of the nation, in regard to
                            the survey and early completion, if practicable, of a canal that will
                            bring them immediately into the marts of the world. The proposed subsidy
                            of a line of American steamers running from Panama to Valpraiso and back
                            is also a measure full of incentives to a revival of our tade, and the
                            withdrawing of it from foreign bottoms. I his, in conjunction with a
                            revised and lessened railroad tariff, is a consummation devoutly wished
                            for, and much and great disappointment was felt by all American citizens
                            when its failure to meet the approval of Congress was announced to us.
                            For the statistical details of our imports and exports through this
                            isthmus, I respectfully refer you to the annual report accompanying my
                            report for the quarter ending September 30, 1870.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> In answer to a circular I received from
                            the Department of State, dated 19th August last, requesting me to
                            communicate any information and to make any suggestions that may tend to
                            increase the commerce between the United States and the Spanish-American
                            countries, I beg to submit the following remarks: The exports of Peru
                            are cotton, wool, bark, orchilla, hides, goat-skins, sugar, silver, and
                            guano. The most important, and by far the most wealth producing of these
                            articles is guano, yielding an enormous revenue to the government, with
                            very little expense. This is shipped chiefly to Europe for manuring the
                            worn-out and exhausted lands of the old countries, while the new lands
                            of the United States do not require that stimulant. Hides and goat-skins
                            are nearly all sent to New York, where they are skillfully and rapidly
                            converted into manufactured articles. Sugar is shipped to San Francisco,
                            the vessels bringing back a return freight of lumber and flour. Cotton
                            and wool are sent principally to England and France. The reason is very
                            obvious; the United States produce more cotton than is required for
                            their own manufactures, and they consequently export the balance to
                            Europe, while England produces no cotton, but she imports and
                            manufactures large quantities of it. Orchilla is also shipped to
                            England, where it is in great demand on account of her cotton
                            manufactories. Bark is sent exclusively to England, there being no
                            demand for it in the United States. The cargo traffic from here to
                            England, via the Isthmus, consists mainly of cotton, orchilla, and bark;
                            and the reasons I have already adduced above may partly explain why it
                            should seek Liverpool and London rather than New York.</p>
                        <p>England produces very little raw material, but she imports it in great
                            quantities to be sent abroad again in manufactured goods. The United
                            States is not only a manufacturing country, but also produces raw
                            material in great abundance, so much so that she has a surplus to export
                            to Europe.</p>
                        <p>The reasons why a greater quantity of European than American goods is
                            imported into this country are various. First, an English line of
                            steamers was early established on the coast, which had the effect of
                            drawing to these countries numbers of English, French, and German <pb
                                n="264" xml:id="pg_264" facs="0298"/>merchants who directed the
                            commerce to Europe, rather than to the United States, and who imported
                            into these countries European wares to supply the wants of the
                            inhabitants, thus cultivating by degrees a taste and a necessity for
                            European manufactures. Second, the low prices of European goods, as
                            compared with American, is another recommendation in their favor. The
                            perfection of machinery and cheapness of labor enable European
                            manufacturers to successfully compete with the United States, where
                            labor is so much higher than in Europe. Third, European merchants are
                            more thrifty, and are content with smaller profits than American
                            merchants, which also enables them to sell their goods at lower rates.
                            If the Isthmus Canal be constructed, the great influx of Americans in
                            this country will tend to alter this state of things. The establishment
                            of American commercial houses would naturally open up and widen the
                            commercial relations between these countries and the United States.</p>
                        <p>In defect of the ship-canal I would suggest that an American line of
                            steamers be established from San Francisco to Valparaiso, which would
                            increase the investment of American capital on this coast, and in
                            proportion as American firms would augment in number, and the resources
                            of the country be developed, so would the commerce of the United States
                            begin to preponderate, and at last to supersede that of Europe.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> In compliance with your circular of August
                            19, I beg to state the following:</p>
                        <p>The commercial relations of the United States and this country are very
                            insignificant, and I shall try to explain the reasons thereof to the
                            best of my knowledge.</p>
                        <p>Under the Spanish rule of Mexico commerce was monopolized entirely by
                            Spain, with total exclusion of all other nations, and those monopolies
                            went even so far as to prohibit the raising or manufacturing of a great
                            many articles in this country, in order to oblige Mexico to import such
                            things from Spain.</p>
                        <p>After a whiles-when Mexico made itself independent, still by far the
                            largest part of its commerce, as well as its mines and agriculture,
                            remained in the possession of Spaniards, and, so far as agriculture is
                            concerned, remains so still, although mining interests have passed into
                            the hands of the English, and a good share of the commerce is done by
                            German houses as well as French houses. American commerce is hardly
                            represented at all. This fact I think is the result of different
                            coincidences, namely: First. That at the time Mexico declared its
                            independence the United States had so much to attend to at home, and
                            capital there found fully enough good investment, that people did not
                            look abroad for commercial relations; while Europe, where capital was
                            superfluous, eagerly caught the opportunity offered to establish new
                            business relations, and succeeded in this so well that, up to the
                            present <pb n="265" xml:id="pg_265" facs="0299"/>day, by far the
                            greatest part of all importations are made by European houses.
                            Therefore, it would require the establishment of large American houses
                            in this country, who, by giving extraordinary inducements, might change
                            the present current of business, and bring it home into its natural
                            course, although it would also require that our manufacturers should
                            condesend to manufacture the particular styles of goods generally used
                            in the country. Whether all those exertions would be compensated, I
                            rather doubt, at least as long as the present state of misery and lack
                            of confidence prevail; and thus far there are not even the most remote
                            signs of a change for the better.</p>
                        <p>The second reason is, that the state of affairs, politically as well as
                            financially, of this country is too well known and understood in the
                            United States as to induce our commerce to invest capital on a large
                            scale here; and business men there would a great deal rather trust their
                            goods to China than to this country; and I know of a good many instances
                            where merchants in this country, whose credit is good to any amount in
                            Europe, were refused it in the States.</p>
                        <p>There does not appear to be any wish nor willingness on the part of our
                            commerce in the United States to improve relations with this country at
                            all, and, the way things are here at present, this is but prudent.</p>
                        <p>If our government does wish to induce American commerce to come to this
                            country, then the principal and first thing to be done would be to take
                            the necessary steps to give the necessary security and protection to
                            such property, and the certainty to get full and immediate redress in a
                            case where this property is unlawfully taken from them.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> In accordance with Consular Regulations
                            No. 720, I have the honor to report that this consulate comprises nearly
                            the entire State of Chihuahua, and part of the States of Durango,
                            Coahuila, and Sonora, consequently being the largest consular district
                            in the Mexican republic. Being an inland post and such a remote place,
                            void of regular communications, this district is generally very little
                            known to the outer world; but the time is arriving when this northern
                            part of Mexico will become important.</p>
                        <p>The State of Chihuahua, center of my consular district, since the end of
                            the civil strife, made many steps in the line of progress not inferior
                            to the other States of the republic. The Indian war, carried bravely by
                            the inhabitants, has allowed the cultivation of lands formerly
                            abandoned, diminishing the perils that formerly prevented the opening of
                            communications. Owing to the pacific character of its inhabitants, order
                            prevails always in this State, and no obstacles are opposed to the
                            present administration, under which the State has decidedly gained in
                            population, wealth, instruction, and also in commodities of private
                            life.</p>
                        <p>The completion of the projected railroad, extending from the United
                            States to the Rio Grande, will raise this part of the country to a level
                                <pb n="266" xml:id="pg_266" facs="0300"/>with its sister States, and
                            perhaps excel them in matter of importance. Considering the immense
                            resources which it can furnish in its different branches of industry,
                            mining, commerce, and agriculture, when this city will be the center of
                            deposit of all the products raised in the northern and middle States of
                            this republic.</p>
                        <p>The resources of mining are inexhaustible; gold, silver, copper, tin,
                            lead, are found in abundance, and rich ores are discovered continually,
                            but not the millionth part of it is explored, owing to scarcity of
                            capital, lack of energy, and the careless character of its inhabitants,
                            which is noticed in all their business transactions; and to this
                            circumstance is attributed that most foreigners make their fortune in
                            this country, taking advantage of the nonchalance of the Mexicans.</p>
                        <p>The commerce of this State has been dull for many years, owing to the
                            prostrated condition of the country, and has lately received a severe
                            shock by enforcing the collection on merchandise imported to the full
                            extent of the tariff; formerly only one-third of the duties was exacted.
                            Few goods, which had arrived at the time the full duties were enforced,
                            have since passed the river at Presidio del Norte, the importers having
                            agreed with the customs to pay the former duties of the tariff, and to
                            subject themselves to the decision of the president of the republic, to
                            whom the matter has been referred. Under this arrangement two
                            wagon-trains, mostly loaded with debenture goods, have arrived, being
                            circumstantially obligated to accept of this proposition. Others have
                            not passed with their goods, having no confidence in this
                            arrangement.</p>
                        <p>It is almost impossible to arrive at any exact conclusion as to the
                            amount of importation of goods, owing to the arbitrary collection of
                            customs, who shape their entries accordingly. It is supposed to amount
                            to about one million and a half of dollars. Likewise, only a defective
                            information can be obtained as to the real exportation of silver dollars
                            and bullion. The mint in this city shows a coinage of about half a
                            million of dollars annually, but it is estimated that twice that amount
                            is smuggled out of the country.</p>
                        <p>The exports are confined to silver dollars and bullion; other products
                            cannot be exported for lack of cheap transportation, the distance to the
                            first railroad line or the nearest water communication being about
                            twelve hundred miles.</p>
                        <p>The external commerce is carried on by wagon-trains, drawn by mules and
                            oxen, which have to traverse the great deserts between here and the Gulf
                            of Mexico, or to the nearest point of the Northern Pacific Railroad. The
                            interior commerce is also carried on by wagons, where the roads permit,
                            and by pack mules and jacks in the mountainous part of the country. The
                            average freight by wagon-trains on import from Lavaca, Texas, or
                            Sheridan, Colorado, is generally eight cents gold per pound, and on
                            export or return freight from four to six cents on produce, and two per
                            cent, on specie and bullion.</p>
                        <p>The climate of this northern part of Mexico, lying 4,850 feet above the
                            level of the sea, is mild, and not subject to either extreme heat nor
                            severe cold. The summer heat does not exceed 80° Fahrenheit in the
                            shade, and does not reach zero in winter. But little rain falls, and
                            only during the months of July, August, and September, the rest of the
                            year being dry. This city has become the refuge for consumptive persons,
                            even from the United States.</p>
                        <p>The cultivation of the arable land with the aid of irrigation, and the
                            quantity of productive land, is more than sufficient to support a
                            population ten times as large as the present one, which numbers about
                            souls. The American population of this State is shorter than <pb n="267"
                                xml:id="pg_267" facs="0301"/>that of any other nationality except
                            the English, although many Germans established here are citizens of the
                            United States. The capital is invested in commercial business and
                            mining, and only two factories of woolen and cotton goods are in
                            American hands, the produce of which are only sufficient for the
                            consumption in this State. The yield of corn is 200 per cent.; that of
                            wheat 80 per cent., and the crops never fail entirely, on account of the
                            irrigation. As to fruits, peaches, grapes, apricots, and quinces, grow
                            abundantly, and are of the finest quality; also apples and pears, but
                            have not the fine flavor and plentiful juice as those grown in the
                            North. The crop of cereals has been so very abundant this year that the
                            price of corn is reduced to 50 cents the fanega, (2 ¾ bushels,) and
                            first rate wheat to $2.</p>
                        <p>This State is well adapted for cattle and sheep raising. The grazing
                            lands embrace more than one-half of the State, and the finest gramma
                            grass is found in the plains and the accessible mountain ranges
                            throughout the year, springing up like magic after the first showers of
                            rain have refreshed the land. Farming and grazing are profitable in the
                            vicinity of mining places, and in the neighborhood of cities, and in
                            that region bordering on our lines for exportation to our frontier forts
                            and the consumption of our soldiers.</p>
                        <p>Having shown by this short statement that the productions of mining are
                            inexhaustible; that the products of agricultural industry and
                            cattle-raising are innumerable; and considering this city to become a
                            center point of deposit, the commerce could be expanded to a fabulous
                            extent, and be of the greatest future importance, naturally the question
                            arises how this immense wealth could be turned to benefit the commerce
                            of the United States. The medium to effect this desired object is
                            railroad communication and establishment of telegraph lines, and to make
                            an advantageous commercial treaty with this republic.</p>
                        <p>As is already known to the Department, referring to my dispatch No. 68,
                            of the 16th instant, an exceedingly favorable concession has been
                            granted by the Mexican government to an American company for the
                            construction of a railroad and telegraph line from a point on the Rio
                            Grande to Guaymas, on the Gulf of California, This projected railroad
                            proposes to connect on the Rio Grande with a line now being constructed
                            from Marshall, Texas, or another being built from Preston, Texas, to the
                            Rio Grande. This road, if built over the road lately surveyed, would
                            pass through the northern part of this State and the State of Sonora,
                            and apart from considerably shortening the distance from New York to the
                            Pacific, as per northern route, it would naturally increase very
                            materially the commercial relations between the United States and this
                            part of Mexico, particularly in regard to exportation; facilitating the
                            exportation to the United States of dollars and bullion, of ores of
                            different metals that now go to Europe, mostly smuggled from the Pacific
                            to vessels ever laying off that coast for that express purpose. It would
                            throw into the United States the immense trade not only of the
                            productions of all the northern States of this republic, but also the
                            productions of the States of Zacatecas, Aguas Calientes, Durango,
                            Coahuila, and San Luis Potosi, after railroad connections are formed
                            with those States; which in return would import from the United States
                            large quantities of foreign merchandise for consumption, since very
                            little manufacturing is done in all these States.</p>

                                rend="italic">et sequitur,</hi> of consular instructions, I herewith
                            transmit a report on the trade of the consular district under my
                            charge.</p>
                        <p>There being no official publication of commercial statistics, no official
                            record, even no periodical publication of imports or exports, prices
                            current, or trade circulars, I have been compelled to rely upon the
                            statements of prominent merchants of La Paz for the facts herein
                            submitted to the Department, and must necessarily generalize where I
                            would be explicit. Wherever the word <hi rend="italic">peso</hi> occurs
                            in this report it refers to the “feeble” dollar of 80 cents; the word
                                <hi rend="italic">boliviano</hi> to the hard dollar of 100
                            cents.</p>
                        <p>La Paz is not a producing center, and derives its commercial importance
                            wholly from being the point whence are distributed the goods imported
                            via Arica for the eastern and northern districts of Bolivia. The
                            principal productions of Bolivia are the so-called Peruvian bark,
                            cotton, sugar, rice, tobacco, chocolate, India-rubber, coca leaf,
                            vanilla, cinnamon, copaiba, sarsaparilla, jalap, ipecacuanha, and
                            numerous medicinal products unknown beyond her own borders. Gold,
                            silver, platina, copper, tin, lead, and cobalt are mined very
                            successfully.</p>
                        <p>Peruvian bark, coca leaf, and the metals are the staple articles of
                            production.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Peruvian Bark</hi>.—This extremely valuable product of
                            the variety known as calisaya, the richest in the salts of quinine, is
                            almost the exclusive product of Bolivian forests, growing on the slopes
                            of the Andes. That produced upon the plains, although identical in
                            appearance, is notably deficient in the percentage of quinine, and,
                            consequently, in commercial value. It is, I regret to say, gathered in
                            the most reckless and wasteful manner by the professional bark-cutters,
                            who, careless of future crops, look only to present gain. The trees are
                            felled and the table or trunk bark stripped from the accessible
                            portions, leaving perhaps one-third of the bark—that which rests upon
                            the ground and that of the branches—to perish by decay. It seems
                            incredible that a material readily salable in La Paz at from 50 to 70
                            cents per pound should be permitted to go to waste from gross
                            carelessness; yet every effort made for the protection of the tree, or
                            prevention of waste, has proven ineffectual. The inevitable consequence
                            is the yearly diminution of the crop and gradual rise in price.</p>
                        <p>The present year about 10,000 quintals of 100 pounds each have arrived in
                            La Paz—a diminution of nearly 8 per cent, over the yield of last year;
                            while the price has risen from 52 pesos (of 80 cents gold value) to 68
                            pesos.</p>
                        <p>The bark is sorted in La Paz, generally by actual chemical analysis, and
                            packed for exportation in ceroons of raw hide of 150 pounds each, two of
                            which form a mule load. These are sent to Arica, Peru, the nearest
                            seaport, and thence shipped, generally via Cape Horn, to the American
                            and European markets. The expense of reaching these markets, including
                            land carriage, freight, and waste, averages 28 pesos per quintal.</p>
                        <p>The export duties are upon tabla or trunk bark 5 pesos per quintal; upon
                            canuto or hauch bark, 2.80 pesos. The date of the extermination <pb
                                n="269" xml:id="pg_269" facs="0303"/>of this extremely valuable
                            plant is not far distant, a calamity whose importance it were difficult
                            to estimate.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Coca</hi>.—This curious plant, which must not be
                            confounded with the nut-producing chocolate, or that of the cocoa palm,
                            is almost unknown beyond the confines of Bolivia and Peru. It is grown
                            on terraces on the mountain slopes of warmer regions, principally in the
                            province of Yungas. The plant is a shrub of rapid growth, producing
                            three crops annually, in March, June, and November. The annual product
                            is about cestos, or baskets, of 25 pounds each, whose market value in La
                            Paz ranges from 8 to 12 pesos per basket. The collection of the
                            government tax of 90 cents per basket is sold annually by sealed tender.
                            This year it produces 240,000 pesos. This leaf, when consumed by those
                            addicted to its use, in which may be included the entire Indian
                            population of both sexes, is made into a little ball, containing in the
                            center a small pill of the ashes of a plant rich in potash salts, and is
                            then chewed until all its peculiar properties are exhausted. It gives
                            great vigor and freedom from fatigue, and the Indian foot mail, or the
                            soldier heavily accoutered, will march cheerfully twenty-five leagues
                            per day, sustained by this wonderful leaf. The want of food seems little
                            felt, but the coca is a necessity. It has attracted the attention of
                            physicians as a nervous stimulant, and preparations of it are prescribed
                            with excellent results. In the southern portion of the United States I
                            believe it could be cultivated with success, and might form a valuable
                            addition to our materia medica.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Copper</hi>.—The copper mines of Corocoro, a town
                            fifteen leagues southwest of La Paz, yield abundantly, although without
                            machinery for drainage or working, the water infiltrating being removed
                            in the most primitive manner, on the backs of Indians. The ore is
                            extremely rich, containing from 70 per cent, up to pure crystals of
                            native copper. It occurs in a gangue of indurated clay, in the form of
                            minute metallic grains, is separated by a simple system of washing, and
                            sent to the coast on llamas, bearing 100 pounds each. The copper product
                            of these mines last year was from 65,000 to 68,000 quintals. Its value
                            is estimated at 8½ pesos per quintal of 70 per cent, fine, or in that
                            proportion for higher grades. It is commercially known as banilla. The
                            trade is controlled by English and French houses, no American capital
                            being invested in it.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Gold and silver</hi>.—The precious metals are produced
                            in abundance in Bolivia. The sands of the mountain streams yield gold in
                            dust, seed-gold and nuggets, while quartz mining is pursued with varying
                            success. By the law of October 12, 1869, referring to coinage, which
                            formed the subject of my dispatch No. 6, of February 16, last, the
                            exportation of uncoined bullion, whether of gold or silver, is
                            prohibited, the mint authorities offering to purchase the entire yield
                            at the following prices: Gold at 612 bolivianos or hard dollars; silver
                            at 38 50/100 bolivianos per killogram of 1000/1000 fine. An export duty
                            of five per cent, is levied upon the new comage. The effect of these
                            provisions has been to unsettle exchanges, diminish transactions,
                            encourage contraband remittances to the coast, and to utterly defeat the
                            obtaining of any approximate idea of the real production of the precious
                            metals.</p>
                        <p>During the year 1868 the national mint of Potosi purchased, of silver,
                            228,152 marks, 3 ounces, 4 drachms, 1 tomin, and 9 grains, at a cost of
                            8.38 bolivianos per mark, or 1,933,133.57 bolivianos. During the same
                            year it issued coin to the amount of 2,610,730 bolivianos.</p>
                        <p>In 1869 it purchased of silver 159,362 marks, 2 ounces, 6 drachms, 3 <pb
                                n="270" xml:id="pg_270" facs="0304"/>tomins, costing 1,358,969 30
                            bolivianos, and coined 1,903,685 66 bolivianos.</p>
                        <p>No gold was purchased or coined, and none exists in circulation, save of
                            foreign coinage, even this being rapidly absorbed for hoarding—a common
                            practice in this country of frequent revolutions and consequent
                            insecurity.</p>
                        <p>The coin issued during the two years mentioned consisted of a species of
                            medal, of which I inclose two samples. An official analysis of the same,
                            made at the mint of Santiago, (Chili,) gives the value of silver
                            contained therein as 28 per cent, in Chilian currency. As the Chilian
                            gold dollar is equal to 91.275 cents, estimated in American gold, it
                            follows that this coin is worth intrinsically 25.557. Yet it is the
                            circulating medium of Bolivia to-day at 40 cents, or half a peso, or
                            about 65. This will account at once for the discrepancy in the amount
                            paid by the mint for bullion in 1868 and 1869, 3,292,102.87 bolivianos
                            Or hard dollars, and the nominal value of the issue for the same period,
                            4,514,415.66 bolivianos. In the official report to Congress of the
                            secretary of the treasury, now before me, the government acknowledges a
                            net revenue, after paying all expenses of coinage, &amp;c., from this
                            source, of 979,211.02 bolivianos.</p>
                        <p>The mint machinery at Potosi, built in Philadelphia at a cost of
                            bolivianos, is now coining, in obedience to the law quoted, hard dollars
                            of full weight and fineness; but so slowly that the few issued readily
                            command a premium of from 10 to 12 per cent., irrespective of the export
                            duty of 5 per cent., which is probably evaded.</p>
                        <p>No country in the world is so flooded with counterfeit coin as Bolivia,
                            often only to be distinguished from the genuine by its superior
                            workmanship.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Coffee</hi>.—The coffee of the Yungas region is
                            unsurpassed in delicacy of flavor, even by the famed Mocha. Its
                            production is, however, extremely limited, probably not exceeding twenty
                            or thirty tons annually, and I doubt whether any, save a few samples as
                            presents, has ever reached the United States. Were transportation easy,
                            it would, doubtless, form a notable article of export, and its
                            cultivation increase tenfold. At present it is almost exclusively
                            cultivated for home consumption, and is obtainable in La Paz at from 20
                            to 25 cents per pound. The same may be said of the other products of
                            Bolivia—sugar, cotton, bread-stuffs, cochineal, vanilla, cinnamon,
                            tobacco, rice, cocoa, Indian-rubber, and a host of valuable medicinal
                            and other vegetable productions, all of which are bountifully afforded
                            by the almost uncultivated soil, yet never find their way, to any
                            extent, to the markets of the world, from dearness of
                            transportation.</p>

                            communication with France and England, from the coast, affect our
                            commercial relations with Bolivia as seriously as with Chili and Peru,
                            where the lion’s share of all commercial and industrial enterprises is
                            in English hands. The heavy freights from the coast render our trade
                            insignificant. In American cotton fabrics, La Paz receives yearly about
                            500 bales. It costs nearly 1 cent per yard to bring such fabrics from
                            Arica, the port of landing, to La Paz, eighty leagues.</p>
                        <p>Kerosene oil is largely used here. It costs $1 50, gold, per gallon, at
                            retail, (five gallons.) American tools are preferred, but there is no
                            direct trade, the few in the market having been purchased in Lima. Our

                            important industrial enterprises owe their establishment in Bolivia to
                            American capital, most of them to one man, Mr. Henry Meiggs, formerly of
                            Catskill, New York, and now engaged in railroad contracts in Peru,
                            amounting to $70 000,000. Mr. Meiggs, in October last, entered into a
                            contract with the Bolivian government, by which he purchased,
                            irrevocably, all the guano of the deposits between 23° and 25° south
                            latitude, belonging to Bolivia, agreeing to pay $6 per ton (of 2,240
                            pounds) for the first million tons, and thereafter to pay to Bolivia for
                            all that he might extract the same price as paid Chili, the joint owner
                            of the deposits, less 50 cents per ton, the extraction to be at his own
                            expense.</p>
                        <p>In return for this concession, he agreed to loan the government tour
                            millions of bolivianos, (five millions of pesos,) one million of which
                            has already been paid, the payment of the other three being conditional
                            upon the decision by the Chilian courts of the case of the former
                            contractor, Arman, of Paris, who failed to comply with his
                            obligations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Meiggs has contracted with Chili for working of her portion of the
                            guano beds. The territory alluded to was disputed ground, both Chili and
                            Bolivia claiming it, but finally agreeing to work the deposits jointly.
                            He has already expended half a million of dollars in buildings,
                            machinery, railroads, &amp;c., without having exported a single ton.</p>
                        <p>The Mejillones guano, as it is called, from the name of the bay where
                            found, is phosphatic, containing but a small percentage of ammonia, and
                            brings about £8 sterling per ton in the European markets. Some few
                            thousand tons having been offered for sale in the Chilian market by the
                            government, brought about $14 gold per ton, exclusive of $2 50 per ton
                            for extraction. The present Bolivian congress, now sitting at Oruro,
                            passed a, law on the 10th instant approving the contract made with Mr.
                            Meiggs, in so far as regarded the loan, but materially modifying the
                            terms of the contract, declaring that instead of paying $6 per ton, as
                            covenanted in October last, he should pay the same price as paid to
                            Chili, less 50 cents per ton. In the event of his refusal to accept
                            these modifications in his contract, the president is authorized to
                            annul it and call for fresh proposals. This modification implies a loss
                            to Mr. Meiggs of over $5,000,000, and may result in very serious
                            complications. The purpose of this dispatch will, however, only permit
                            me to allude to the subject briefly at present.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Banco Boliviano</hi>.—Another important investment of
                            American capital in Bolivia is the Banco Boliviano, established by
                            decree of the government in October, 1868. It has an exclusive privilege
                            within the territory of the republic for fifteen years, is granted the
                            same right of summary process as possessed by the government itself in
                            collections, is exempt from taxation or the use of stamped paper, and
                            made the depository of all legal consignments. It is a bank of discount
                            and deposit. Its capital (nominal) is two millions of hard dollars, of
                            which 300,000 have been paid in. Its sole stockholder is Henry Meiggs,
                            before alluded to. On the 1st of January last it declared a dividend of
                            15 per cent., or $45,000, and on the 1st of July another of 22 per
                            cent., or $66,000, being together 37 per cent., or $111,000 in eighteen
                            months. Since its establishment it has not lost one dollar from bills
                            discounted or money loaned. It is managed with distinguished prudence
                            and ability by Don Lorenzo Claro, an experienced Chilian merchant and
                            financier. The average circulation (in bills of 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100
                            hard dollars) is $180,000.</p>
                        <pb n="272" xml:id="pg_272" facs="0306"/>
                        <p>The benefits conferred upon the commercial community by the establishment
                            of this institution may be inferred from the fact that when founded the
                            customary rate of interest, even upon the best securities, was from 18
                            to 30 per cent, per annum. It now rules at from 8 to 12, and at short
                            dates, with approved securities, as low as 6 per cent, per annum.
                            Hitherto, in the contributions demanded by the government of the
                            business community, (one in July last and one now being imposed,) the
                            bank has been respected. Whether this immunity is due to its being the
                            depository of the people in general, to its being established upon
                            foreign capital, or to its frequent favors to the government, I cannot
                            say.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Crédito Hipotecario</hi>.—Another institution,
                            established partly upon American capital, but admitting Bolivian
                            stockholders, was opened on the 1st day of January, 1870. It is entitled
                            the “Crédito Hipotecario de Bolivia,” or Bolivian Mortgage Bank, and is
                            modeled after the <hi rend="italic">crédit forcier</hi> of France. Its
                            capital consists of 1,000 shares of 1,000 bolivianos each, of which 10
                            per cent, is paid up. Its object is to loan upon real estate, bonds
                            bearing the same interest (now 10 per cent.) as paid to the society by
                            the borrower. The latter pays an invariable semi annual sum to the
                            society, consisting of 5 per cent, interest, ½ per cent, for
                            administrative expenses, and a further sum, applicable to the sinking
                            fund, of ½, 1, 2, or 2½ per cent., according to the series to which his
                            loan has been referred by the board. The sinking fund increases with
                            each payment, and the original debt, diminishing in like proportion, is
                            gradually extinguished, the longest term being in twenty-four years, the
                            shortest eleven. This institution has enabled many, groaning under the
                            unbearable pressure of mortgages, at 24 or 30 per cent, per annum, to
                            avail themselves of its advantages, and to borrow at rates from 12 to 16
                            per cent., with the knowledge that each semi-annual payment diminished
                            the obligation. Some fifty-seven loans have been made since the
                            organization of the society, ranging from 500 to 3,200 bolivianos each,
                            and the coupon bonds issued in exchange are quoted steadily at 90 per
                            cent, and accrued interest.</p>
                        <p>These two institutions, simplifying the relations of debtor and creditor,
                            rendering, from their privileges and from their careful management,
                            litigation almost impossible, lowering enormously the former oppressive
                            rates of interest, have met with fierce but ineffectual opposition from
                            those whose interests they wounded, but have been warmly supported by
                            the community at large. Mr. Meiggs holds 300 shares in the latter
                            institution. Two hundred more are held in Chili, the balance here.</p>
                        <p>A fourth enterprise, involving American capital, is that of Henry Meiggs
                            &amp; Co. for draining three large lakes at the head of the Valley of
                            Clisa, near Cochabamba, for the purpose of irrigating the valley and of
                            rendering fertile an immense extent of territory now unproductive. Three
                            of the partners are Americans, the fourth a Chilian. The capital to be
                            invested will be about $300,000, of which one-tenth has already been
                            expended in preliminary operations. The ownership of the lakes has been,
                            by the government decree, perpetually invested in the company. The lands
                            of the valley will be enhanced in value millions of dollars upon the
                            completion of the requisite canals and locks. The lakes are 75 feet
                            above the upper end of the valley, and, being fed by springs, are deemed
                            inexhaustible.</p>
                        <p>A fifth American enterprise in Bolivia, of importance perhaps greater
                            than all the rest, is that of the National Bolivian Navigation Company,
                            chartered by the United States during the recent session of Congress,
                            possessing several valuable grants from this government, which were
                            ratified <pb n="273" xml:id="pg_273" facs="0307"/>by the Bolivian
                            congress on the 11th instant, and fully empowered by the government of
                            Brazil to carry out its aims and objects, which are briefly to connect
                            immense regions of Bolivia, lying on the eastern water-shed of the
                            Andes, with the rest of the world, by means of steam navigation. I look
                            upon this enterprise as of the deepest importance to our commercial and
                            industrial interests. Bolivia is as yet a <hi rend="italic">terra
                                incognita,</hi> walled in from her sister nations by natural
                            barriers, only to be overcome by the steamer on the east and the
                            locomotive on the west. Navigation once established on the sources of
                            the Amazon and its tributaries, and a vast region of unrivaled fertility
                            and capacity of production will be opened up to the enterprise of our
                            people; a region whose products are all of great intrinsic value. A
                            market will be opened in return for our agricultural implements, tools,
                            and textile fabrics, and a new field of industry for such as deem our
                            own too narrow. The eastern sections of Bolivia, at the headwaters of
                            navigation, are sparsely populated for the want of outlet. A few Indians
                            load their rude balsas, made of logs, with Peruvian bark, sarsaparilla,
                            gold, and gums, and undertake the journey of two months’ weary and
                            dangerous navigation, exposed to all sorts of discomfort, and reaching
                            the mouth of the Amazon, or the stations of the Brazilian steamers,
                            purchase a year’s supply of clothing and necessaries, and slowly regain
                            their homes, well satisfied with the results of the voyage. What
                            commercial results may we not look for when steam and intelligence
                            penetrate these solitudes! It is almost incredible that the products of
                            the eastern slope of the Andes should be packed on mules over the steep
                            and dangerous mountain paths at an altitude of 15,000 feet, thence to
                            descend to the coast to be shipped for Europe or the United States, upon
                            vessels which, six months before, had passed the mouths of rivers whose
                            waters are navigable to the very centers of production. Yet such is the
                            case. The rapids of the Madera, the only important obstacle, will be
                            surmounted either by railroad or canalization. The requisite steamers
                            are now being built in the United States, and within a few months I hope
                            to announce the arrival of the American flag in Bolivian waters.</p>
                        <p>On the western slope of the Andes the Peruvian government has contracted
                            for a railroad from Arequipa (already connected with the Pacific by rail
                            at Yslay) to Pimo, on the borders of Lake Fibicaco. From La Paz to the
                            hither border of the lake is but twelve leagues, nearly level, and quite
                            unobstructed by steamers of importance. A direct railroad from La Paz to
                            Tacna has been also put under contract.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">General observations</hi>.—A large numerical majority
                            of the population of Bolivia is composed of aboriginal Indians, of the
                            Aymara and Quchua races, the former in La Paz and its vicinity, the
                            latter in the rest of the republic. They retain their native dress and
                            language, and are the serfs of the higher races. Centuries of oppression
                            have taught them to hate and tear their conquerors, but physical
                            inferiority and hereditary timidity render them harmless. Their general
                            expression is sad in the extreme; even their music is all in the minor
                            key, and they weep at the slightest pretext. An amount of feudal service
                            is still exacted from them. Those residing on estates must serve a week
                            about as house servants in the city residence of the proprietors, and
                            bring a weekly contingent of tagua or llama-dung, the universal fuel of
                            La Paz, where wood as fuel is unknown.</p>
                        <p>There being literally no roads throughout the country, all traffic
                            between the great centers and the outer world is perforce conducted by
                            mules and llamas.</p>
                        <p>The usual cost of bringing a cargo of 300 pounds from Tacna. the terminus
                                <pb n="274" xml:id="pg_274" facs="0308"/>of the Arica railroad from
                            the coast, or <hi rend="italic">vice versa,</hi> is from 18 to 25
                            pesos.</p>
                        <p>Mules of great strength are required to bring exceptional articles,
                            pianos, sofas, &amp;c., from the coast, at a cost of 100 pesos each, and
                            at very great risk to the load. The writer recently received an iron
                            fireproof safe, of New York manufacture, by this means. When received it
                            was broken into four pieces, and consequently useless.</p>
                        <p>To illustrate the cost of articles brought from abroad, I may mention a
                            small printing press recently sent from New York for a gentleman in
                            Cochabamba. Its original cost was $117 80 in currency; upon arriving at
                            La Paz it had cost $231 66 in gold, about 120 per cent, having been
                            added to the original invoice. It has still an inland journey of 85
                            leagues to undergo. It is not surprising, therefore, to find common
                            white ware plates selling at 50 cents each. Ink costing 30 cents in
                            Paris brings $1 25 here. Kerosene oil, quoted at 30 to 40 cents in New
                            York, costs the consumer over $1 50 in La Paz, and in like proportion
                            for all imported goods.</p>
                        <p>Until railroads, or even good ordinary roads, are built from the coast to
                            the interior, it will be idle to expect the trade of Bolivia with the
                            outer world to show activity or progress. Her cinchona and copper are at
                            present her chief and almost only exports, the former becoming daily
                            scarcer and poorer in quality, the latter exposed to all the
                            vicissitudes of a mining interest.</p>
                        <p>The commercial future of Bolivia is, however, full of happy presage. If
                            she curb the revolutionary spirit so chronic among her people, and only
                            kept under by the iron hand of her present president, who, for the past
                            six years, has averted every attempt at his overthrow; if she resolutely
                            determine to devote her energies and resources to the intellectual and
                            material progress of her people, she has a grander future than Chili or
                            Peru. Her resources are greater than those of either of her sister
                            republics; but they need development and an outlet. Her productions
                            could be increased tenfold, but they require scientific working and
                            reasonable proximity to water carriage.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> Your circular from the Department of
                            State, bearing date August 19, 1870, came to hand by the last steamer.
                            In reply to the order to communicate facts and make suggestions touching
                            the improvement of relations between the United States and Spanish
                            American countries, I have the honor to report as follows:</p>
                        <p>It should be stated, probably, as a prefatory remark, that the amount of
                            produce which this country furnishes, in either raw or manufactured
                            articles, to be shipped from this particular department of said Spanish
                            American dominion, is, in comparison to <hi rend="italic">any</hi>
                            portion of the United States reclaimed from territorial primitiveness,
                            but a meager part. And the main portion of the commodities shipped from
                            this port is gathered from the forests, from animals, and through other
                            sources in which the want of commendable enterprise and industry are
                            sadly, though palpably, plain to be seen. The political economist and
                            historian will, in the <pb n="275" xml:id="pg_275" facs="0309"/>domestic
                            troubles of Mexico, readily recognize the cause of all this. Yet there
                            are other causes, patent to the recognition of commercial observers,
                            which tend largely to subtract from the United States the carrying trade
                            and add it to other nations. One of the articles most extensively
                            exported from this coast is the mahogany and other fine-grained woods
                            used in the manufacture of furniture. Although they are in demand in the
                            United States, with fair and acceptable prices advertised, yet the
                            realizing price the shipper obtains is but a part of his honest
                            expectations; for on landing his cargo in the United States ports he is
                            subjected to two and very different measurements, on one of which he
                            pays freight and the forest laborers who furnish the wood, and the other
                            measurement is that by which his commodity is sold, whereby, in one
                            instance furnished me, the discount in measurement amounted to forty per
                            centum, on that for which the shipping party paid freight and original
                            purchase; whereas in the European ports the custom of the purchaser is
                            to pay for all the wood received, being governed by the same absolute
                            measurement in purchasing as the customs and carriage departments do in
                            establishing tariffs and freights. A knowledge of this unequal
                            measurement being in the possession of shippers, gives the fine woods of
                            the east of Mexico to Europe. Few articles other than this one instance,
                            and probably none other in the short list of those exported from this
                            country, are subject to the same objectional embarrassments as the fine
                            woods. But even this is a great drawback to the interests of American
                            shipping and manufacture; for there is a majority of the sailing vessels
                            which come well ladened, but are compelled to return in ballast; and
                            those which do not are principally European vessels bound for home ports
                            and ladened with those fine woods, which, but for them and our American
                            tradesmen’s refinement in financiering, would have been compelled to
                            have gone too in ballast, or, at least, to have divided the shipments to
                            our own country. The Mexican and Vera Cruz Railroad Company have
                            contributed and will continue to contribute largely to the shipping
                            interests of England to and from this country. Said railroad is owned by
                            English capitalists, and English vessels bring Iron, ties, bridges,
                            machinery, cars, &amp;c., from England, and return with mahogany, making
                            an active and lucrative business with Mexico, while our ships too often
                            come with light freights and return in ballast. Yet American machinery
                            is more popular here than English. As a proof of this, American cars and
                            engines are more sought and prized by this same English railroad company
                            than their own. Further, and with other classes of machinery, I had the
                            great pleasure of visiting, in company with the Hon. Thomas H. Nelson,
                            his most estimable and accomplished lady, and several citizens, the
                            extensive cotton manufactories near Puebla, and it was observed by all
                            the visitors, and the truth affirmed by the employés, that more work was
                            accomplished, and equally well, by less hands and less propelling power,
                            by the American machinery in use, than by the English. Both kinds were
                            worked by adjoining interests, and the contrasts were very perceptible;
                            while the English machinery is much more heavy and expensive, doubtless
                            more durable, but once out of order requires transshipment to England to
                            be repaired, which the American does not. This railroad company receives
                            a subsidy of $800,000 per annum from the Mexican government, promptly
                            paid, to assist in this laudable enterprise of developing their country.
                            I learn this company extends, probably, no more than the amount of this
                            subvention and the net earnings of those portions of the road now
                            completed and in successful operation, in each year. It is twenty-five
                            years since the road was commenced, and of the 300 miles of <pb n="276"
                                xml:id="pg_276" facs="0310"/>the road primarily to be constructed,
                            50 miles of the Vera Cruz and 120 of the Mexico end are completed. The
                            intermediate distance of 130 miles is incomplete. Five miles have been
                            completed in the past year of very unfavorable surface for railroad. I
                            give these particulars because the remark has been made to me by
                            officers now engaged in the construction of this road, that the company
                            now owning it would dispose of it to an American company on advantageous
                            terms. I am creditably informed that the finished portions are jointly
                            clearing to the company over $700 per day, and have been doing so for
                            the past year. This country holds no diplomatic intercourse or relations
                            whatever with England, and hence the insecurity which the company feel
                            surrounds them, induces them to dispose of what, under other and better
                            circumstances, would be considered a capital investment. It is therefore
                            presumed that an American company would be more profitable both to
                            themselves and the Mexican nation than as the contract now stands. These
                            facts advertised in the United States may induce capitalists to
                            investigate and consult their own interests in this enterprise; and
                            should the road be transferred to American capital, and some abuses of
                            our mahogany merchants be corrected, doubtless the commercial and
                            shipping interests, by said acts, will become much improved in the
                            United States. There are other railroad enterprises in and through
                            Mexico which should receive the commendatory indorsement at least of the
                            American Government, and probably of American capital, pointing in the
                            same direction and to the same end as that to which allusion has just
                            been made.</p>
                        <p>No company or parties, however, would be wise in any investments of
                            Mexican enterprise or speculations without <hi rend="italic">thorough
                                and competent</hi> legal investigations, as the under-current of
                            financial deceptions in Mexico is so strong and popular that few
                            foreigners managing the schemes of public improvements are sharp-sighted
                            enough to steer clear of destructive breakers. I believe a war vessel
                            stationed close upon our southwestern coast, with occasional cruisings
                            to the Gulf ports of Mexico, would contribute to our commerce by
                            diverting a very suspicious trade into legitimate channels, and into
                            heavier-tonnaged vessels not now owned by the shipping interests of this
                            country, and by those larger vessels landed in the chief ports of the
                            United States. Whereas now, Zona Libra, or free-belt district of
                            country, whose headquarters are at Matamoras, now receives large
                            consignments of what I think is intended to be consumed in the United
                            States markets, and should go to New Orleans. There was at one shipment
                            from this port $20,637 37 worth of coffee, cocoa, and Campeachy thread
                            sent to Matamoras, nearly five times as much as was shipped to any port
                            from Vera Cruz, of which I am aware, at one time, for the past year.
                            This shipment occurred August 20th last, on board the schooner Zona
                            Libra, which was but a month before purchased from American owners, and
                            then called Annawan. The invoice was 527 sacks coffee, 10 sacks cocoa,
                            and 3 bales Campeachy thread. The shipment was made from this port by J.
                            Galainena &amp; Co., very respectable merchants of Vera Cruz, and
                            consigned or sold in Matamoras. My office was simply to authenticate a
                            signature, which I did without further inquiry. I do not know that
                            illegitimate traffic was exercised by any parties interested in said
                            cargo, nor can I fully aver that a war vessel would be able to correct
                            the transactions, even though it were a certainty that smuggling did
                            prevail, for that transaction referred to was one between two Mexican
                            ports, over which a vessel of war belonging to the United States could
                            exercise no legitimate control.</p>
                        <p>The shipping docket of this port presents one very serious obstacle <pb
                                n="277" xml:id="pg_277" facs="0311"/>to the encouragement of
                            maritime intercourse with Mexico, and that is the number of sailing
                            crafts which leave it in ballast. The enterprise of this country should,
                            with its natural productiveness in a multiplied diversity of ways,
                            furnish ample freight to all out-going vessels: whereas the true
                            condition is the reverse. Here, too, we fail to have control, although
                            American example is a precept much preached about in Mexico. I can see
                            no promising prospect of things being much better, because the laws,
                            admitting them to be good enough, (which I am loth to do,) are so often
                            viciously and treacherously administered, that enterprise is thoroughly
                            intimidated and stultified. The rapacity of revolutionists levying
                            contributions and extortions upon crops, farms, trades, capital, and
                            stocks, confiscates all ambition and honesty of purpose in the
                            acquisition of anything which may be subjected to their mendacity. It
                            has nearly completed an exodus of all the foreign element of Mexican
                            society, who could, even by heavy losses, leave the country.</p>
                        <p>We have, however, four lines of steamships, which, by the aid they
                            receive from either their own governments or the Mexican, are doing a
                            better business, so far as creating trade is concerned, than the sailing
                            vessels. They succeed in obtaining more or less freight each way. But
                            these could not make whole their yearly losses, if left without
                            subsidized assistance. The American line is patronized by a subvention
                            from Mexico, and receives no assistance from the home government
                            whatever. There is no doubt in my mind but that Mexico has practically
                            tested her own interests in thus patronizing foreign-built steamers,
                            inasmuch as she had comparatively none of her own upon which to bestow
                            her munificence. The governments of England and France have manifested
                            wisdom in the support they render their maritime powers. Their
                            industrial pursuits and manufactories go hand in hand with their marine;
                            one branch being protected by such partial legislation that it consumes
                            another. Our country produces most of the raw material which feed our
                            manufactories. Hence their independence of the shipping interests as
                            importing agents of foreign produce for their support. Yet the
                            productions of the tropics, if consumed or manufactured in the United
                            States, must of course be transported thence in ships, and hence to
                            reduce import duties on such as cannot be produced within the limits of
                            our Government, and to encourage vessels in doubtful lines of traffic,
                            will evidently draw to our shores much that now, under other flags and
                            in other bottoms than those of our own nationality, go to other and more
                            distant ports. If we draw the trade from them we will, sooner or later,
                            draw their tradesmen, their capital, and flags back to ships never owned
                            but by American capitalists, who but for a better profit sailed under
                            foreign colors. The family partiality should never be so exercised as to
                            drive any of its well-meaning or even erring members from home.</p>
                        <p>I hold that our Government should show its liberality largely to those
                            branches of enterprises which redound so benignantly to its
                            aggrandizement and prosperity; and thereby believe that the national
                            obligations will the more easily and rapidly be met. Our high protection
                            has already built up colossal capitals of wealth and influence. Some
                            large fortunes, in the estimation of poor laborers who work them, are
                            realized in even a single day by some of our highly protected and highly
                            patronized manufacturing establishments. I am glad to see their success,
                            as it is glory to American genius; but I do not like to see it at the
                            expense of our crippled and enfeebled commerce, now dwindling into an
                            almost fatal marasmus, and which has paid and is paying, both directly
                            and more largely indirectly, so large a proportion of our national
                            indebtedness. Then why not return the compliment? <pb n="278"
                                xml:id="pg_278" facs="0312"/>If commerce contribute so bountifully
                            to the delinquent wants of the Government, why should our noble and just
                            Government be so tardy and coy in response recompense? Doubtless, if
                            Congress will seek the profundity of this casket for a solution of the
                            hidden mystery, touching the source and fountain of commercial success
                            in the United States, it will be found. But evidently these crude views
                            from Vera Cruz is but “carrying very inferior coals to Newcastle,” where
                            larger and liner ones are mined. It is said, however, in adage, that we
                            should go from home to learn domestic secrets. Hence, perchance, I hear
                            that the lobby for high protection in Washington during the last
                            revision of the tariff was of prodigious proportions, a fact (if it is
                            one) within itself sufficient to have made the bill too low rather than
                            too high by all just and considerate legislators. The histories of
                            lobbies are immensely uniform in their expressions; that a weak and
                            languishing cause cannot afford a heavy and expensive lobby. Also, that
                            a just and palpable series of facts intrusted to the integrity of what
                            should be the best men in the nation require no lobby. And further, if a
                            lobby advocate a just cause it is because a neglect has been perpetrated
                            and popular feelings fear a further continuance.</p>
                        <p>These problems, justly solved, will do more for the acquisition of
                            Spanish-American commerce than all else of which I can comprehend.</p>
                        <p>Feeling that you want but an index, as it were, of facts as they impress
                            me in this port, I submit them with renewed assurances of my most
                            faithful consideration and esteem.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt, September 27, of the report from the Department of State in
                            relation to the condition of the commercial relations between the United
                            States and the Spanish American States, accompanied by an official
                            circular giving me instruction, without “unnecessary delay,” to
                            communicate to the Department of State any suggestions which I may deem
                            useful in aiding the President more “fully to comply with the request
                            contained in the Senate resolution” for information on the subject
                            specially considered in said report. Presuming that you desire the
                            response to your request may reach your Department prior to the opening
                            of the approaching session of Congress, in view of the uncertainty of
                            the mails between this country and the United States, I improve the
                            earliest opportunity, somewhat hastily, to prepare my communication in
                            season to go in the next steamer which leaves Rio de Janeiro for New
                            York.</p>
                        <p>I regard the resolution of the Senate, and your able and suggestive
                            report, highly opportune. The exigencies of the commercial and maritime
                            interests of the United States demand that a prompt exercise should be
                            made of all the legitimate agencies of the Government, with the view to
                            bring South America into closer relations with our country. The causes
                            which have deprived the United States of their due proportion of the
                            trade of the Spanish American states are lucidly presented by you and
                            need not be repeated in this connection. What I have to <pb n="279"
                                xml:id="pg_279" facs="0313"/>state in respect to the commercial
                            interests of the countries of the Rio de la Plata can be considered,
                            with sufficient definiteness for all practical purposes, under two
                            heads. What is there here to attract the commercial and maritime efforts
                            of the citizens of the United States? What important step is immediately
                            necessary in order that the United States may secure a larger proportion
                            of the commerce of the Rio de la Plata countries?</p>
                        <p>In respect to the first inquiry, it would be just to say that the natural
                            resources of these countries and the present aggregate of their
                            productions and trade are too imperfectly understood in the United
                            States. True, the unsettled civil and political condition of these
                            countries for many years has greatly lessened the bulk of their
                            productions and commerce, and these unfavorable influences are still
                            operative. But in these regards there has been an obvious improvement,
                            comparing decade with decade. It is fair to presume that a much better
                            future is not distant for the increase of South American population,
                            products, and commerce. The Rio de la Plata countries are beginning to
                            feel the impulse of the railroad and the organized capital and
                            industries which this powerful agency of modern civilization always
                            creates in its path. Already in the Argentine Republic more than a
                            thousand miles are in operation, or will soon be completed. Already
                            Buenos Ayres has a population of 200,000, and is a city of rapidly
                            growing importance as the commercial center of a vast and fertile
                            territory. Uruguay has a soil and climate unsurpassed, Montevideo, so
                            often the theater of political revolution, has made rapid progress
                            within the past few years, and is to-day a city of large wealth and
                            nearly 100,000 people. Its location, so near the mouth of this vast
                            system of rivers, which drains a country capacious and productive enough
                            to feed two hundred millions of people, is one of the best for commerce
                            on the South American continent. Though still in the midst of a
                            political convulsion, Uruguay has caught the railroad impulse from her
                            Argentine neighbors. An important concession has just been made to a
                            wealthy English company for the building of a railroad through nearly
                            the entire length of the republic, striking the Uruguay River at the
                            best point, which, when completed, cannot fail largely to increase the
                            trade, wealth, and population of Montevideo. Unmistakable railroad
                            logic, by its shorter lines, tends to bring the products and exchanges
                            of the entire country of Uruguay, Southern Brazil, Paraguay, and the
                            Argentine States of Entre Rios and Corrientes to Montevideo. The entire
                            amount of the commerce of the Rio de la Plata and its tributaries is far
                            from being inconsiderable at present. In 1869 the aggregate exports and
                            imports were nearly $100,000,000 by the gold standard of the United
                            States. The railroads already in operation and those building, the
                            steamboat lines now engaged in the interior navigation, and others Soon
                            to be organized, necessarily must largely increase the business of
                            Buenos Ayres, and make the commercial points of augmented importance to
                            the maritime and commercial interests of foreign nations. England,
                            Prance, Belgium, and Italy have evinced their watchful foresight by
                            establishing their lines of steamships, placing the Rio de la Plata
                            countries comparatively near Europe. These steamships arrive weekly at
                            Montevideo and Buenos Ayres, laden with the fabrics of European
                            industry, and depart as often, freighted with the products of these
                            countries. These steamers afford the European merchants admirable mail
                            accommodations, and prompt and regular delivery of freight. Thus the
                            nations which operate these lines of steamers have secured the principal
                            part of the trade of this portion of South America. These English,
                            French, Belgian, and Italian <pb n="280" xml:id="pg_280" facs="0314"
                            />companies have now running to Montevideo about <hi rend="italic">forty
                                iron steamers, ranging in size from nine hundred to three thousand
                                tons each.</hi> Thus European merchants and manufacturers reach
                            these countries ten or fifteen days ahead of the manufacturers and
                            merchants of the United States. Trade in these days <hi rend="italic"
                                >will not wait.</hi> Ten days behind-hand is fatal. There has been
                            made as decisive a revolution in trade by steam and iron, as in the
                            methods of war. A few hours and days are everything. Celerity
                            promptness, and regularity are absolute masters of commercial
                            opportunities and enterprises. Who better capable of appreciating these
                            truths than the business men of the United States? But to win what
                            legitimately belongs to ns, Government must help.</p>
                        <p>Not a single American steamer plying to the Rio de la Plata. No mail
                            accommodations worthy of the name. All persons here dealing or
                            attempting to deal with the United States, say the most reliable way
                            they have of sending and receiving their letters is via Europe. The
                            American monthly steamer from New York to Rio stops 1,030 miles short of
                            Montevideo, and 1,160 miles short of Buenos Ayres. The Brazilian post
                            office at Rio de Janeiro is a “dead box.” Why should not the commercial
                            center of Brazil be the southern limit to American trade in the opinion
                            of the Rio officials? Yet why should Rio de Janeiro be made an exchange
                            depot of the Rio de la Plata trade at the expense of the commercial
                            interests of the United States? England, France, Belgium, and Italy have
                            provided against this “obstruction” at Rio. The European steamers make
                            through transit to Montevideo and Buenos Ayres; their pursers all mail
                            agents and carriers of samples of European fabrics and machinery, and
                            the European consuls serve as postmasters. My suggestion, then, is for
                            Congress to immediately grant aid to establish direct steamship and mail
                            connection with Montevideo and Buenos Ayres. Until the present contract
                            with the New York and Rio company shall have expired, it may be
                            expedient to subsidize a line to run from Buenos Ayres to Rio de Janeiro
                            in connection with the New York line. As soon as the United States
                            contract with the New York and Rio de Janeiro company shall have
                            terminated, there should be a continuous line from the United States to
                            Montevideo and Buenos Ayres. Experience and financial figures
                            conclusively prove that with the latest improved steamboat machinery,
                            swift steamers can be run the 6,200 miles from New York to Montevideo at
                            less expense than a line of the same tonnage, driven by the machinery
                            and with the models of 1860, can be run the 5,200 miles from New York to
                            Rio de Janeiro. The extreme unwisdom of the Rio de Janeiro obstruction
                            is therefore obvious.</p>
                        <p>Shall the manufacturers, merchants, mechanics, and ship-owners of the
                            United States be excluded from the markets of the Rio de la Plata? Or
                            shall they at once be put in possession of the latest improved methods
                            of transit?</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of State Department circular dated August 19, also copies of a
                            report of the Department to the President in answer to a resolution of
                            the United States. <pb n="281" xml:id="pg_281" facs="0315"/>Senate in
                            regard to the commercial relations between the United States and Spanish
                            American countries. It is a lamentable fact that, notwithstanding the
                            geographical contiguity and political friendship existing between all of
                            these countries and the United States, their commercial relations are
                            not what they should be; and while we may regret the political cause
                            which, in past years, caused the commerce of these countries to be
                            diverted to other markets than ours, it is a consolation to know that,
                            with the close of our rebellion, that cause has been forever removed.
                            And under the present circumstances it would seem that the true
                            commercial policy of the United States is to do all in her power,
                            consonant with the public interest, to turn this commerce toward our
                            markets. The commercial relations of Salvador with the United States are
                            very small compared to those with Europe. But I am pleased to say that
                            they are on the increase, and the above is true in regard to all of
                            Central America. One way to increase these relations with the west coast
                            of these republics, is to have them put in direct communication with San
                            Francisco, which is the natural market for much of the produce of these
                            states. And this object is specially desired by these states, as shown
                            by their concessions to a company recently started in Guatemala to put
                            on a line of steamers between the Central American ports and San
                            Francisco, viz: Guatemala gives fifteen thousand dollars per year;
                            Salvador, about eighteen thousand; and the other states, eight or ten
                            each. The above-mentioned line has failed, and the same subsidies can be
                            obtained by any company who will put the line in operation. At present
                            it appears to me that the Pacific Mail Steamship Company is the proper
                            one to take the matter in hand, and as it is as much to our interest as
                            that of these states, it seems nothing more than just that we should
                            meet them with a liberal subsidy to an American company to carry out
                            this object. There can be no doubt that the secret of the number and
                            success of the English steamship lines is due in a great measure to the
                            liberal aid they receive from their government, and in the present state
                            of our commercial relations I do not think the United States can pursue
                            a cheaper policy to increase them. With a direct line to San Francisco
                            it would not take long to build up a good trade with coffee, sugar,
                            tobacco, fruits, &amp;c., &amp;c., and in return will be sent flour,
                            potatoes, wines, soap, &amp;c., &amp;c. In 1869 there were imported from
                            San Francisco to Central America in small sailing vessels forty-five
                            thousand barrels of flour. When the commerce of the Pacific coast
                            arrives on the Isthmus why should it seek the European markets rather
                            than New York? We may say, in the first place, that a large majority of
                            the foreign commercial interest of the west coast is at present in the
                            hands of Europeans, who, naturally, all things being equal, send to
                            their own markets. And, again, the European markets are higher than New
                            York; moreover the commissions and guarantees are higher in New York
                            than In Europe. And, again, by steamship the freights are about the same
                            from here to England as New York. It only costs about five dollars more
                            per ton to send indigo to England than New York, nor more than two
                            dollars more per ton to send coffee to England than New York, and I
                            believe sugar is little cheaper to England. Outward-bound freights from
                            Europe and New York to the west coast, via Isthmus are about the same.
                            It would seem that our being much the nearest market, there should be a
                            greater difference in the freights. Sailing-vessels can be chartered in
                            England, with freight out and back, at twelve to fifteen dollars per
                            ton; of course it takes a long time for a trip, yet much business is
                            done in this way. The same voyage from New York would not be undertaken
                            for anything like the above rate. Again, merchandise can be bought much
                            cheaper <pb n="282" xml:id="pg_282" facs="0316"/>in Europe than in the
                            United States, and the cheapest and most inferior articles are brought
                            to this market with which we cannot compete in price. But I am glad to
                            say that the people are gradually getting their eyes open to the
                            superiority of our manufactures, and are beginning to prefer them
                            notwithstanding the difference in price. It appears now that the
                            interoceanic railroad in Honduras will be pushed forward to completion,
                            and that will give us another means of increasing our commercial
                            relations with these countries. But the grandest enterprise of all to
                            increase these relations is the construction of an interoceanic canal,
                            and I believe the route across Nicaragua will, in the end, be found to
                            be the most desirable. The State of Salvador exported during the year
                            1869 $3,768,357 23, and only $361,688 47 of this amount went to the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>For the same year Salvador imported $3,728,995 62, and not $200,000 of
                            this amount came from the United States. At present we have
                            comparatively little commercial relation with the South Pacific, and it
                            is not likely to improve till an opposition line is put on between Chili
                            and Panama, and an equitable arrangement in regard to freights made with
                            the Panama Railroad. The present line of steamers from Panama to
                            England, via Peru, Chili, and the Straits of Magellan, is owned by one
                            company, and one cause of their extending-their line from Chili, via the
                            Straits of Magellan, to Europe, was the high tariff across the Isthmus,
                            and their rate to and from Chili and Peru is ten per cent, cheaper than
                            the Isthmus route, and they have made their tariff so high between Chili
                            and Panama that little freight finds its way to the Isthmus, and thus is
                            entirely diverted from the United States.</p>
                        <p>It would be pleasing to see the United States sufficiently encourage the
                            establishment of an American line on this route with a lower rate of
                            tariff to New York, so that our market could be put more on a level with
                            those of Europe.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> In compliance with your request in
                            circular of August 19, 1870, for me to give my opinion why the
                            commercial relations between the United States and the Spanish-American
                            republics are so limited, and how an extension thereof could be
                            obtained, I answer you as follows: In the first place, Europe is so
                            densely populated that she lacks the means to give occupation whereby
                            her subjects can gain even a frugal subsistence, and therefore throws a
                            greater number of adventurers and speculators in these countries, who
                            settle in them, than ours. As they have been reared in the straightest
                            economy, they are content with small profits in commercial pursuits,
                            which our people are not, and therefore cannot compete with them; hence
                            the majority of foreign merchants in these countries are Europeans. In
                            the next place, everything imported to these countries are manufactured
                            articles. And again, the cheapness of labor in Europe enables her to
                            manufacture cheaper than we can; and as the majority of importers are
                            from there they naturally look to the fatherland for it. Further, an
                            English company, some years ago, <pb n="283" xml:id="pg_283" facs="0317"
                            />established a line of steamers on the west coast of South America, to
                            ply between Panama and Valparaiso, where by a liberal subsidy from its
                            government enabled it to get in a short time so thoroughly established
                            that it became so strong that an American company without the same
                            advantages could not compete with it. The business of this line is so
                            profitable that they have from four vessels, with which they commenced.
                            increased their number to about thirty-six, completed and running, and
                            several in state of construction; beside factories, warehouses, hulks,
                            &amp;c., &amp;c., in all of the principal ports on the coast. About six
                            of their steamers form a semi-monthly line through the Magellan Straits
                            direct to Europe, which also is becoming very lucrative. All of these
                            steamers being English, they, of course, make direct connections with
                            the English steamers of the Atlantic that ply between different ports in
                            Europe and the Isthmus of Panama. All of aforesaid advantages tend to
                            direct the principal part of commerce from this coast to Europe. And
                            again, the principal part of the products of these countries are raw
                            material, which consists of the following: Medical barks, roots, herbs,
                            &amp;c., &amp;c., cautcho, or chilla, indigo, cochineal, cotton, wool,
                            ivory nuts, nitrate of soda, and ores, which go to European
                            manufactories on account of so much facility in transportation and close
                            business connections. Sugar, in considerable quantities, finds a market
                            in California, and goat skins go to New York. Guano goes to Europe to
                            manure their worn-out lands, which we do not need yet, as our grounds
                            are new and abundant. I think there are three remedies to change this
                            state of things, viz: 1st, to protect home manufacture; 2d, protect
                            shipbuilding and navigation, (which, I am sorry to say, is daily on the
                            decrease,) so as to enable us to compete with Europe; and, 3d, it
                            practicable, (to bring the trade from the republics of the Pacific
                            coast,) the construction of a ship canal at the Isthmus of Panama to
                            connect the two oceans, which would enable craft of all sizes and
                            classes to trade direct from our shores to ports in the different
                            west-coast republics, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa</hi>, where all
                            classed vessels could not cross the Atlantic to Europe.</p>
                        <p>We have already one decided advantage over Europe in these countries, <hi
                                rend="italic">i</hi>.<hi rend="italic"> e.,</hi> being founders and

                            precepts the world ever knew, in America; their sympathies are decidedly
                            ours, and they look upon us as the head of the family, and have rather
                            complained that they have, they think, not received that natural
                            protection of late due them, but at the same time are reasonable, and
                            consider the circumstances why it has not been fully tendered them; but
                            they still cling to us and look to us to assist them to future
                            prosperity. I think they have a better feeling in these countries for
                            our people, resident and transient, than they have for foreigners of any
                            other countries.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your dispatch of August, (circular,)
                            though received by the September steamer, owing to its being in pamphlet
                            covering, was not opened <pb n="284" xml:id="pg_284" facs="0318"/>until
                            the beginning of this month. I have read the same with great interest,
                            and in connection with it the information communicated to the United
                            States Senate on the condition of trade with the “South American
                            countries.”</p>
                        <p>Very early after my arrival in Brazil, stimulated by the views and wishes
                            of the President, and in accord with the progressive trade movements of
                            the United States, I commenced a thorough investigation into the
                            existing trade with Brazil. In my dispatches on this subject I have
                            endeavored to show that while we were by far the largest consumers of
                            Brazilian products, our exports had not kept pace with our imports, and
                            that owing principally to the outrages perpetrated on our merchant
                            vessels during the war, we were left almost without the means of
                            transporting these imports and exports, and thus compelled to rely on
                            other nations to replace a merchant marine which had been the pride of
                            our country and the admiration of the world. In addition to a result so
                            disastrous to our agricultural, manufacturing, and commercial interests,
                            we had to confess that other nations, and especially England and France,
                            had made rapid strides in the construction of sea-going vessels, and had
                            ultimately occupied the position we were forced to abandon, and before
                            the close of the war had their bankers, merchants, products, and
                            manufactured goods firmly established not only in Brazil but in all
                            portions of the world. We may thus add to the cost of our war,
                            indirectly, a loss which may be estimated by hundreds of millions, and
                            which it will require the best statesmanship of the age and years of
                            enterprise to overcome. In complying with the request contained in your
                            circular, I will ask, therefore, that my Nos. 30, 79, 84, 93, 98, 104,
                            114, and 119 may form a portion of this reply, and that you will excuse,
                            in this general review, those defects which must necessarily occur when
                            a subject of such vast import has to be considered in the few remaining
                            days left before my departure for the United States.</p>
                        <p>Brazil, in its people and form of government, is entirely unlike the
                            Spanish-American states. Discovered, settled, and always held by the
                            Portuguese and their descendants, with but little addition to its
                            population, except by natural increase, continued emigration from
                            Portugal, and importations from Africa, the Brazilian of to-day is in
                            his character and impulses the most quiet and perhaps the least
                            enterprising of South Americans, while his condition, strange as the
                            proposition may appear, is quite equal to that of the people who formed
                            the adjoining Spanish republics. It must be understood, however, that at
                            this moment Chili, the Argentine Confederation, and Peru are all
                            thoroughly occupied in progressive movements, by which they will rapidly
                            outstrip Brazil in the race for material development, unless the recent
                            awakening in the empire is followed by a similar spirit and consequent
                            advances.</p>
                        <p>It cannot be denied that this substantial condition is the result of
                            government. Whatever other nations or the United States may say of the
                            empire, the fact is constantly before us that Don Pedro II has been a
                            mild, honest, and enlightened ruler, nay, more, successful in inspiring
                            and retaining confidence at home and abroad. If the form of government
                            administered was not progressive, it was at least stable. The people
                            were taught frugality and economy, and thus, while the strongest and
                            most enlightened nations of the earth have been convulsed by wars or
                            civil commotions, Brazil has kept on the even tenor of her way, and
                            after thirty years on the throne the Emperor, even with his prodigality
                            in destroying General Lopez, by which a heavy burden has been imposed
                            upon his subjects, rules to-day as quietly, and, to all appearances as
                            securely, as at any time before. I mention these facts, Mr. <pb n="285"
                                xml:id="pg_285" facs="0319"/>Secretary, that you may understand what
                            can be accomplished by others not so favored by race, soil, climate, or
                            form of government as the people of the United States, and who are
                            remote from that vast belt which holds in its embrace the wealth and
                            enterprise of the world. This becomes the more interesting as we have to
                            contemplate trade relations with Brazil, which at present are anything
                            but satisfactory to us. Permit me to make an approximate estimate of
                            this trade with South America, and thus show this fact more
                            distinctly:</p>

                        </table>
                        <p>Of this trade Brazil alone furnished twenty-five millions of her
                            products, or over sixty-one per cent, of the whole, and received from us
                            six millions produce, or not quite fifteen per cent, of the whole, and
                            not one-fourth of what we bought of her, or, reduced to actual figures,
                            the result was this:</p>
                        <p>Imports from Brazil in 1869, $25,000,000; exports, $6,000,000; balance
                            against us and for which gold was remitted, $19,000,000.</p>
                        <p>While this immense balance stares us in the face, let us see what Brazil
                            is doing with our nineteen millions of gold. Why, simply investing it in
                            iron, cotton, and woolen goods, building her roads, cultivating her
                            fields, and encouraging the manufactories of England, Belgium, and
                            Germany. This is clearly the result, while at the same time, from her
                            additional exports she keeps nearly square with France, Portugal, Italy,
                            Austria, and Spain, for all that is imported from them.</p>
                        <p>I have had many conversations with Baron de Cotegipe and Mr. do Amaral on
                            this subject, and finally addressed the baron a note on the 1st of July
                            last, a copy of which was sent to the Department, and I beg may also
                            form a portion of this reply. Up to this time this note has not received
                            the attention which the baron acknowledged was due so important a
                            matter, which will be explained in a separate dispatch.</p>
                        <p>The condition is one for which we cannot blame Brazil; this would be
                            weakness. We really are not much at fault ourselves, for it is mainly
                            the result of misfortunes and outrages, which we did not have the power
                            to prevent; but it is nevertheless one which the President and the two
                            Houses desire to have changed, and to the manner of doing this we must
                            now address ourselves, not failing in anything on our part, and relying
                            on the good feeling and sagacity of Brazil to perform her part. Our
                            portion of the work is to prepare for selling Brazil everything she
                            requires from abroad as cheap or cheaper than other nations, and
                            especially those articles which we are so well fitted to produce.</p>
                        <p>Before, however, any suggestions are made, as requested by you, permit me
                            to state what has been accomplished by other nations, so that you may
                            understand the magnitude of any undertaking which contemplates the
                            restoration of our ocean prestige, and especially an extended trade with
                            South America. This becomes the more important from the favorable
                            position of Brazil, and the value to us of her coffee and sugar; for
                            this extended trade with South America means largely extended trade with
                            Brazil. These people are in a great measure familiar with those of
                            England, France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, and Spain, through a long
                            commercial intercourse, conducted in person. The splendid steamers which
                            have reduced the time between Rio and Lisbon to fourteen <pb n="286"
                                xml:id="pg_286" facs="0320"/>days, between Rio and Bordeaux to
                            eighteen days, and between Rio and Liverpool to twenty-one days, have
                            for years carried thousands of Brazilians to Europe, and brought back
                            thousands of European traders and travelers to Brazil.</p>
                        <p>England and France have been liberal in their subsidies to these great
                            steamers, and during the five years when we were driven from the ocean
                            they strained every nerve to establish those relations to which I have
                            referred, and which have resulted so well for them and so unfortunately
                            for us. To-day England’s exports to South America are probably greater
                            than her imports, and while our total imports and exports may be fairly
                            estimated for the year 1870 at not exceeding sixty million gold dollars,
                            those of England will probably reach, if not exceed, one hundred and
                            fifty million of gold dollars; and yet the bulk of the exports are
                            articles which we should supply. We must, therefore, become familiar
                            with the fact that the Spanish South American countries and the empire
                            of Brazil have established relations with these countries for their
                            supplies, are familiar with the form and quality of their goods, know
                            their value, and in every way are settled customers, by the power of
                            mutual material interests. In this connection, however, it is well to
                            state at once, as my opinion, founded on close observation, that there
                            is no sympathy in these countries for Brazil, nor on the part of Brazil
                            toward them, growing out of similar institutions, the old dynasties
                            regarding the empire as an upstart, and Brazilians, on their part,
                            regarding them as declining despotisms, and having really more feeling
                            in common with us than with them. The respect for the generous and
                            honest character of our Government is, I believe, common to all, from
                            the throne to the beggar; for governments are a study with the educated
                            people, and while the general feeling is one of confidence in their own,
                            the wonderful prosperity of all classes in the United States is a fact
                            which is absorbing the profound attention of the best Brazilians. I may
                            state, therefore, that our political system and general prosperity are
                            well understood in Brazil, while the people do not appreciate our
                            commercial and manufacturing advantages, as they cannot comprehend the
                            ability of a country which, though buying the bulk of their coffee, has
                            but few steam or sailing vessels in their ports, no banks and but few
                            merchants in their great commercial cities, and which is content to pour
                            a steady stream of gold into their coffers through foreign channels.</p>
                        <p>There is only one point hitherto insisted on by Brazil which, it seems to
                            me, is extremely unwise for them and unjust to us; that is the export
                            duty of thirteen per cent, on coffee. The nine per cent. export duty on
                            sugar is a heavy burden to the planters of cane, but thirteen per cent,
                            on coffee will eventually bankrupt a majority of the coffee raisers.
                            This thirteen per cent., in the past, may be defended by the pressing
                            financial wants of the empire, especially during the Paraguayan war; but
                            at this time, when duties on imports are being reduced, and the policy
                            is announced that further reductions will be made as the revenues
                            increase, no excuse or argument for its continuance can be sustained.
                            One of the difficulties is that a part of the thirteen per cent. is
                            provincial, but it is only made a difficulty because the Government
                            finds the tax can be so economically and easily collected. In
                            considering this tax, with the baron and others, its excessive and
                            disproportioned, if not unwise character was not denied. Perhaps before
                            I sail the Emperor, or the new minister of foreign affairs, Viscount de
                            S. Vicente, may give me some cheering assurances in regard to its
                            reduction. I have not failed to impress upon this government as well as
                            I could the value of the two cents per pound reduction on coffee made by
                            our last Congress, and the <pb n="287" xml:id="pg_287" facs="0321"/>fact
                            that in the past, as well as at the present moment, foreign exchanges
                            and domestic trade in Rio were almost entirely sustained by the coin and
                            credits we furnished, and I am not without hope that our claims for
                            reciprocity will be promptly and fairly considered.</p>
                        <p>I now proceed directly to place before you the conclusions and
                            suggestions which I think legitimately flow from my dispatches:</p>
                        <p>1. Our policy for the development of our foreign trade must be as liberal
                            and comprehensive in proportion as our domestic policy, and founded upon
                            justice to all portions of our country.</p>
                        <p>2. That we must have the best and fleetest mail steamers that this age
                            can produce, and as private enterprise cannot build and run such
                            steamers in competition with those subsidized by other nations, we, too,
                            must grant liberal subsidies, under proper restrictions, for ten
                            years.</p>
                        <p>3. That our national policy for sustaining our machine shops and
                            ship-yards must be as liberal as that of England.</p>
                        <p>4. That tariffs must be adjusted so as to encourage imports to and
                            exports from the United States, thereby affording freights both ways to
                            our new merchant vessels.</p>
                        <p>5. That while no private enterprise can compete with the subsidized
                            vessels of other countries, our own steamers, if subsidized, should be
                            required to protect our trade in the same manner as those, especially of
                            the English and French steamship companies; which means simply low rates
                            of passage and freights to and from the United States.</p>
                        <p>6. That as a policy founded on justice would place all the commercial
                            cities of the United States in direct communication by steam with those
                            portions of the world with which they can most profitably exchange
                            products, no legislation should occur until notice had been given to
                            each to present their claims for such consideration. The justice of this
                            proposition will not be denied, for no nation can expect the sympathetic
                            support of all its people which favors one portion at the expense of
                            another.</p>
                        <p>7. The earliest possible return to a specie basis. I am firmly of the
                            opinion, Mr. Secretary, that the losses of our people, growing out of an
                            inflated and baseless currency, are submitted to at home only because
                            they are not understood. But with a system so entirely opposed to all
                            the principles of an enlightened economy and a sound morality, we have
                            no right to expect that we can divide trade with nations whose financial
                            systems are based on gold and silver. Our legislators have no longer the
                            excuse or plea of necessity, and their first act should be to give us
                            back the economy and morality of a sound currency. This done, with
                            consequent reforms, we are ready to enter the great race for commercial
                            supremacy.</p>
                        <p>We have learned by sad experience in the United States the value of
                            regular and rapid transportation, until the great natural arteries of
                            trade have been dwarfed by the genius and progress which have created
                            fifty thousand miles of railroad, over which passengers and freight are
                            carried with the speed of a racer and the regularity of a clock. The
                            same qualities are absolutely necessary to success abroad.</p>
                        <p>Our institutions, our vast area and prolific soil, our gigantic internal
                            improvement system, all demand that the progress of the past shall mark
                            our future. If we meet this demand with that wisdom and sagacity which
                            have so distinguished us among the nations of the earth, the products of
                            our soil, the treasures of our mines, the industry of our people, will
                            soon be welcomed in every portion of the world, and the fact forever
                            established that the height, of human attainments can only be reached by
                            a free people.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> In reply to your circular letter of August
                            19, I have the honor to inform you that in my opinion the diminution of
                            commerce between the United States and Mexico is not traceable to
                            political causes, past or present, between the two countries, but finds
                            its source in the extravagant tariff on importations, the consumers
                            having become aware that they pay the principal part of the revenue;
                            hence the limited consumption of articles of commerce that formerly were
                            imported from the United States.</p>
                        <p>The entire system of taxation is indirect, and consequently falls on the
                            consumer; therefore the general revenue from importations depends upon
                            his will and pleasure.</p>
                        <p>Formerly the principal importation into this consular district from the
                            United States was flour, but has now decreased to almost nothing,
                            occasioned by the decree of President Juarez, dated October 31, 1867.
                            That this decree refers directly to flour produced in the United States
                            is evident from the fact that the duties on flour are regulated by the
                            cost of the article in the United States, as the decree sets forth, and
                            it has been the wonder of merchants why this decree was promulgated so
                            soon after the fall of the empire, considering the measures of sympathy
                            for the republic adopted by the Government and people of the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>Dry goods, wines, liquors, and ales can be produced in England and other
                            countries and imported into this country at a lower cost than in the
                            United States, and exchange made in the productions of the country, some
                            of which are Brazil wood, indigo, and mahogany, for which better prices
                            are obtained and a larger quantity consumed than in the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>Another cause of the decrease of the commerce with the United States and
                            Mexico is the heavy taxation on agricultural pursuits, which discourages
                            the producer; consequently he only cares to produce sufficient for his
                            actual wants. The tax on rum and sugar was recently abolished, and a tax
                            of six dollars put upon one hundred square yards of sugar cane.</p>
                        <p>The absence of any bonded warehouse and drawback system, and the
                            requirement of payment of duties the moment goods are landed, is another
                            impediment to legitimate commerce, the duties on a general cargo
                            averaging eighty-five per cent, on the original cost, which excludes any
                            surplus, the importer only keeping on hand enough to supply the
                            immediate wants of his customers. This enormous tariff entirely excludes
                            the legitimate commission merchant from the market, he requiring as much
                            capital to do business as the shipper.</p>
                        <p>The present depressed condition of the finances of this government
                            obliges it to raise a revenue from any source within its reach and
                            control, and to the Mexican congress commerce seems to them the only
                            available source from which to derive it, direct taxation being strongly
                            opposed by the majority of that body, notwithstanding the estimation of
                            about seven millions deficiency to defray the current expenses of the
                            coming year, without public credit to meet the demand, either at home or
                            abroad. Permit me to make a few suggestions with a view to increase the
                            American dry-goods trade with this country. It is a well-defined <pb
                                n="289" xml:id="pg_289" facs="0323"/>law with the merchant of any
                            country that he makes his purchases where he can buy lowest and procure
                            goods best adapted and most salable in his locality. My experience
                            informs me that dry goods salable in one part of this country, of a
                            particular fabric, prints in particular, are unsalable in another
                            locality, the tastes of the people being entirely different. If the
                            American manufacturer can furnish as good an article as the British
                            manufacturer can, at as low a price, and at the recommendation of the
                            importers of the different parts of this country to print their cottons
                            in such figures and colors as will suit the people, I am convinced a
                            fair proportion of this branch of commerce would be diverted to the
                            United States.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have the honor to acknowledge recept of
                            your circular of August 19, inclosing “Report from the Department in
                            relation to the condition of the commercial relations between the United
                            States and Spanish American Republics.”</p>
                        <p>In reply to your desire that I should communicate any facts that would
                            promote said commercial relations, I beg to suggest that a reduction on
                            the freights per American steamers between New York and Aspinwall would
                            greatly augment the exportations from New York. The very exorbitant
                            freights, as per inclosure No. 1, induce merchants to import goods from
                            Europe. It is likewise to be noticed that English merchants give longer
                            credit than the American ones, consequently there is in favor of Europe
                            longer credits and cheaper freights.</p>
                        <p>I also beg to call the attention of the Department to the fact that the
                            English line of steamers on this coast, the Pacific Steam navigation
                            Company; do not regularly connect with the American steamers at the
                            Isthmus of Panama; it often being the case that merchandise from New
                            York is kept waiting for weeks on the Isthmus, while the preference is
                            always given to European goods.</p>
                        <p>The establishment of an American line of steamers on this coast in
                            connection with the Pacific Mail Steamship Company would place the
                            principal commercial transactions in hands of the United States, as the
                            arrival of goods in these ports could be fixed at certain and sure
                            dates.</p>
                        <p>There is sufficient business on this coast to support at least two lines
                            of steamers well organized.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> In obedience to the request contained
                                in the circular of the State Department of the 19th of August last,
                                I have the honor to make some remarks upon the commercial relations
                                of the United States and the Spanish-American countries.</p>
                            <p>I can say that in Mexico the importing and exporting trade, and also
                                the dealings in bills of exchange, are in the hands of foreign
                                houses, principally German, English, and French, and I am told that
                                in the rest of Spanish America it is also the case. It must then be
                                assumed that the Spanish Americans have not the power to control and
                                direct their trade neither here nor there, unless it be by a treaty
                                favoring one or some. As to the above-named foreign commercial
                                houses, they are guided in their operations more by the precepts or
                                laws of trade than by preferences for the productions of their
                                respective nations; because it is seen that the Germans bring for
                                sale more English and French merchandise than goods produced by
                                German countries; the French do the same, mixing English goods with
                                their French stocks; the English also take some goods from the
                                continent, and all, merchant-like, strive to bring what may give
                                quick and good results.</p>
                            <p>By tradition I know that in times past nearly all Mexico drew
                                supplies from the ports of the United States and Cuba, and there
                                sent specie, &amp;c., for investments in bills of exchange or
                                purchases of cotton, &amp;c., for remittances to Europe. It appears
                                that then we had a larger trade than now, but in reality it was,
                                perhaps, not so. Foreign goods, bought purposely for the trade by
                                New Orleans or New York houses, or foreign bonded goods, were
                                brought here in larger quantities than those of our production.</p>
                            <p>My assertion that European houses in Spanish America deal in goods
                                that are in demand, whether produced by their own country or not,
                                can be verified by inquiries made of our various consulates. English
                                manufacturers first, French next, and the commercial houses of
                                Hamburg, Bremen, &amp;c., derive the greatest benefit from the trade
                                with Spanish America.</p>
                            <p>A solid support possessed by the European houses in Spanish America
                                is the low <pb n="291" xml:id="pg_291" facs="0325"/>rate of interest
                                they pay to their home constituents, being only from 4 to 6 per
                                cent.; goods not quickly realized can bear this burden: but an
                                American merchant, to his home constituents must pay from 6 to 9 per
                                cent., and this is an obstacle to ordering home goods, because all
                                sales run the risk of some demurrage. Another advantage to Europeans
                                is that wool, gum, dyes, drugs, &amp;c., shipped to Europe give
                                better returns, on account of the low custom-house duties.</p>
                            <p>Regarding the shipments of specie directly to the banks of England
                                and of France, at all times, it should not be looked upon as proofs
                                of the proceeds of exclusive European commerce. Americans might find
                                it beneficial to give the same direction to their bullion. In times
                                of broils the chieftains of Spanish America have the reputation of
                                being depredators, so merchants have commonly their specie insured
                                against land and sea risks. Policies of insurance for such risks are
                                emitted in Europe only, up to this time.</p>
                            <p>When specie is placed in a port for shipment it costs about the same
                                to place it in Europe as in the United States, and for the sake of
                                exchange operations it is disposed of with a higher profit when
                                stored in London or Paris.</p>
                            <p>The commercial inferiority of our own country in Spanish America may
                                be owing also to our present inaptitude to furnish the goods or
                                wares that are suitable to Spanish America; the preference which is
                                given to European fabrics is because these take their fancy better.
                                Europeans in times past as well as now have made it an object to get
                                up and gather samples of what is desired in silk, linen, cotton, and
                                woolen goods, and other wares. This course insures ready return at
                                paying prices, and a continued increase of trade.</p>
                            <p>It has been observed frequently that American dry-goods imported into
                                Mexico give bad results; the dull colors and patterns of the goods
                                are not relished by Hispano-American tastes, which call for what is
                                gaudy even if flimsy, Cotton prints are of vast consumption, and
                                ours, as far as class and solidity go, are superior to the European,
                                but are inferior in designs and bright colors.</p>
                            <p>Our inland or domestic trade is fairly prosperous, so that our
                                manufacturers of dry-goods and other wares have not been compelled
                                as yet to seek buyers abroad like the English, French, and Belgians;
                                but it will be wise perhaps to see how we can enlarge our foreign
                                trade willingly and gradually, before we are absolutely forced to it
                                by not knowing how to dispose of our future over-productions. Mexico
                                is to us differently situated than the rest of Spanish America,
                                especially if some day the ship canal to the Pacific be cut through
                                it, or even through Central America. If with Mexico we could have a
                                treaty for mutual free trade, it would benefit her and ourselves. At
                                present her wool, for instance, cannot go to our country on account
                                of the heavy customs dues, and many other articles are in the same
                                predicament. Our cotton fabrics of the present could compete with
                                the European ones only if they were admitted with a differential
                                duty in their favor.</p>
                            <p>With the many waterfalls and steam-power of the United States, joined
                                to the home production of raw cotton, we have the elements for
                                becoming sooner or later like England, another workshop of the
                                world: we could be particularly prominent and excel in cotton
                                fabrics. Europeans have to go far to obtain the raw material, carry
                                it to their spindles and looms, and go out with it afterward to seek
                                a market, making carrying operations that are unnecessary for
                                us.</p>
                            <p>It seems that it would be money well spent if Congress could make a
                                steady yearly appropriation to employ competent agents to collate
                                information and samples for the benefit of the manufacturers of our
                                country.</p>

                        <p>The cost of India-rubber has increased in proportion to the demand in
                            consuming countries, and is still now double what it was at the
                            beginning of the term named. Exports to England show a nearly equal
                            increase, being 975,520 pounds in 1851, against, in 1869, 5,069,824
                            pounds; and the whole amount exported stands as 2,949,600 pounds in
                            1851, 11,631,584 in 1869.</p>
                        <p>It must be remembered that the surplus stock is constantly overflowing
                            from one to the other country, so that the above statement must not be
                            considered the exact measure of consumption in England or the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>I hand also a table of general exports from this port during 1869,
                            showing shipments to United States, $3,275,363; Great Britain,
                            $2,731,551; other countries, $2,138,616. Making the whole export from
                            this port about $8,000,000.</p>
                        <p>The next in importance to rubber is cacao. This goes almost exclusively
                            to France. The value of our exports to the United States greatly exceeds
                            that of our imports. The balance of funds for purchase is provided by
                            drafts on England, based upon letters of credit granted by banking
                            houses in New York.</p>
                        <p>India-rubber is not a product of cultivation; it is extracted from a
                            forest tree, and no restriction is placed by government on those who
                            resort to the public domain to obtain it. It is said that the forests
                            nearest to purchasing markets are being exhausted, the trees being
                            killed, or yielding less milk from too frequent tapping, but the
                            producing area is so vast, and means of access to remote points are so
                            rapidly increasing, that we do not look for any immediate falling off in
                            the supply; on the contrary, the production will probably steadily
                            increase for years to come. Cacao is cultivated, though carelessly; it
                            is not a sure crop, and has partially failed for the last two seasons.
                            The other articles named are all natural products, only annotto
                            requiring considerable labor to prepare it after gathering the seed. The
                            statement of exports may be relied on as nearly accurate, but such I am
                            sorry to say is not the case with the official table of value of
                            imports, to which I next call your attention. It must, at best, be
                            regarded as a not very close approximation to accuracy. I hand it in
                            because it is official, and its errors may in some degree be corrected
                            by table No. 2 of packages imported, which I obtain from private
                            sources, but which also, in some respects, is erroneous. Leaving to each
                            the considerations it may deserve, I would offer my own estimate,
                            derived from various sources. Thus, whole value of imports, 1869,
                            $6,000,000. Of which, from England, not less than half, and probably
                            $4,000,000. The remaining $2,000,000 from France, Germany, Portugal, and
                            the United States, our portion not exceeding $500,000. The principal
                            article that comes to us from the United States is flour. Of this we
                            import about 2,000 barrels per month, or say, 25,000 to 26,000 barrels
                            yearly; the consumption of our market is rated at 2,000 barrels per
                            month. Trieste sends us, one year with another, about 2,000 to 2,500
                            barrels of superior quality, equal to the formerly high character of the
                            Richmond brands, Eallego, and Haxale, but the cost is too high to
                            compete seriously with ordinary American qualities.</p>
                        <p>Lard, kerosene, soda crackers, axes, and machetes, a few pine boards,
                            some chairs, Florida water, and patent medicines close the short list of
                            American importations. The first four articles only are important in
                            value, and have heretofore withstood European competition. Collins’s <pb
                                n="293" xml:id="pg_293" facs="0327"/>axes, machetes, and other steel
                            manufactures still hold the high place which their superiority over
                            European work of the same class long since gained for them, but their
                            sale is limited by cheap imitations, particularly of machetes, imported
                            from Germany, and sometimes even bearing the American name and
                            trade-mark. Recently, however, an article of German manufacture has been
                            produced, which is said to be fully equal to that made in America and of
                            somewhat less cost. American axes, machetes, and other steel goods have
                            so long maintained a superiority over all others that we have regarded
                            them as a national specialty; but I fear we are about to meet serious
                            competition from continental manufacturers. In heavy cottons, our supply
                            of which was, up to 1861, chiefly derived from the United States, we can
                            no longer compete with England. Unbleached goods, (drills, ducks, plain
                            cottons,) stripes, and blue goods are no longer looked upon by American
                            importers as forming part of their cargoes; a few bales only are
                            received for sale to those who may require a superior article for some
                            particular use, but the amount is unimportant. Even previous to our war
                            flimsy imitations of American goods were appearing in the market at low
                            cost. Our internal troubles enabled England to obtain possession of the
                            market, which she still holds, by cheapness of productions and cheapness
                            of transport.</p>
                        <p>As regards cheapness of production it is unnecessary for me to make any
                            suggestions; the subject has been fully discussed for years; it opens
                            many collateral isssues, and I could not hope to throw any further light
                            upon it. It is sufficient for me to say that England does produce
                            cheaper goods than we produce, and that she has driven us from this and
                            other foreign markets by doing so.</p>
                        <p>The question of cheapness of transport is an important one, with which as
                            regards foreign trade the Department may not be so familiar, and I
                            proceed to state certain facts.</p>
                        <p>Up to about one year ago the direct trade between England and this
                            country was conducted through sailing vessels. At that time two steam
                            lines, unsubsidized, and intended chiefly for freight, were started from
                            England, say Liverpool, to this country, touching at Lisbon, and at
                            Maranhao and Ceara, ports on the Brazil coast. Their measurement is
                            about 1,000 tons; capacity of freight, 1,400 to 1,600 tons, weight and
                            measurement; cost, £30,000 each; and they make the voyage from Liverpool
                            to Para in about twenty-one days. They placed their rate of outward
                            freight at the same price as that of sailing-vessels, 40<hi
                                rend="italic">s</hi>. per ton; and though this rate has since been
                            raised to 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., sailing-vessels cannot compete
                            with them, and, in fact, so far as relates to general cargo, have
                            abandoned the trade.</p>
                        <p>The great variety of cargo, coming not only from England but from the
                            continent, much of which is of small bulk compared with its value,
                            furnishes abundance of freight and makes the percentage of transport
                            charges very small. Not only has the original enterprise increased its
                            tonnage, but a third line is already contemplated.</p>
                        <p>On goods of small value compared with their bulk the rate is even as low
                            as 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per cubic
                            foot. This applies particularly to barrels of ale and porter, &amp;c.
                            Even taking the highest rate charged, say 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.
                            per ton, it amounts to only about 30 cents per foot.</p>
                        <p>We have a steam line running monthly from New York, touching first at
                            Para, thence to Pernambuco, Bahia, and Rio de Janeiro. It is subsidized
                            by both governments, but as American exports consist of bulky goods of
                            comparatively small value, they cannot bear the freight of steam
                            carriage, and these steamers have not affected the business of
                            sailing-ships, by which the imports to this port are yet brought.</p>
                        <pb n="294" xml:id="pg_294" facs="0328"/>
                        <p>The duty charged on many American imports is very heavy, and diminishes
                            amount by lessening consumption. I annex tabular statement of duty on
                            imports and exports.</p>
                        <p>The imperial government has recently declared that its financial
                            condition is sufficiently favorable to allow of a diminution of import
                            duties. Any influences which our Government may be able to exert in this
                            sense will of course be favorable to general trade, and it is thus only,
                            so far as I can see, that the action of our government can benefit
                            commercial relations between the two countries. The duty on many
                            articles of foreign manufacture amounts to a prohibition in the northern
                            provinces; the object of the system being “to encourage national
                            industry,” a most mistaken policy, in this country at least, when in all
                            the provinces agriculture suffers from want of labor, and in the
                            Amazonian provinces the population is not sufficient to gather the
                            natural products of the country.</p>
                        <p>A few unimportant manufactures are, by the system of high duties,
                            protected in Rio de Janeiro, and all the northern provinces suffer in
                            consequence. The civilizing agency of cheap comforts is thus denied,
                            specially to the provinces of the Amazon, containing a population of
                            perhaps 300,000, scattered through a country reaching from the mouth of
                            the river Amazon to the eastern borders of Peru and Bolivia. Of this
                            population perhaps 30,000 are slaves.</p>
                        <p>A considerable business is done with Peru and Bolivia in merchandise
                            partly brought here, and partly imported with special destination by
                            merchants established in those countries.</p>
                        <p>Difficulty of access makes the trade of Bolivia small as yet, but that
                            with Peru is already important, and is increasing in value. No duties
                            are charged in the eastern riverine ports of either country. By an early
                            opportunity I will forward some statistics in regard to this trade.</p>
                        <p>I have thus furnished such information as I believe meets the views
                            expressed in your circular. Brazil is, however, scarcely within the
                            terms of that circular, or of the Senate’s resolution. It is not a
                            “Spanish-American State,” nor is it “in close relations of geographical
                            contiguity” with the United States, nor would its form of government
                            suggest any special “political friendship” with a republic. Yet will the
                            same means which the Government may find effective to increase our
                            commerce with other countries be equally applicable to Brazil. In none
                            of the Spanish-American States is the feeling toward our country more
                            kindly than it is in Brazil, and this is particularly the case as
                            relates to the Amazonian province the apprehension of territorial
                            encroachment, which sometimes causes great uneasiness in States that are
                            nearer to us, does not exist in Brazil, and the impolitic centralization
                            of authority in Rio, under which these remote provinces suffer serious
                            inconvenience, is often contrasted with the government of a country
                            which is in fact as near to them as their own capital, to which they are
                            forced to appeal in matters involving daily interests. Commercial
                            relations do not, however, depend upon, indeed are scarcely influenced
                            by, political sympathies. It is not to any sentiment of friendship in
                            this or other countries that we must look for the development of
                            commerce. Trade has but one law, which is invariable, viz., to buy in
                            the cheapest market. We shall not be able to meet the competition of
                            rivals until we can produce as cheaply as they can produce, and carry as
                            cheaply as they can carry; whether the advantages of cheap labor are
                            profitably bought, by the aggregation of a large population in a limited
                            area, is another question, and one which it would not become me to
                            discuss. But in answer to your permission “to make such suggestions as I
                            may deem <pb n="295" xml:id="pg_295" facs="0329"/>useful,” I will
                            briefly add that the commercial relations between the United States and
                            this country will be promoted—first, by any means through which the cost
                            of our home productions may be lessened; next, by such efforts as may
                            reduce the duties of import and export in this country; and, finally, by
                            inducing the government of this country to abandon the idea of
                            protective tariffs in order to devote its whole strength to agricultural
                            development, in which its true interest lies. Whatever may be the
                            benefit of a protective system elsewhere, it is certainly an error here;
                            nor, indeed, is it within the range of human intelligence to administer
                            such a system in a country of vast extent and varied production without
                            injuring one portion for the benefit of another.</p>
                        <p>Until recently all the steamers plying on the Amazon River were of
                            British build, and this was due entirely to the fact of certain American
                            builders having, years ago, accepted a cheap contract from the Peruvian
                            government for boats to ply on the upper river. They soon decayed, and
                            the result of this short-sighted policy was to exclude for many years
                            all American-built boats from Amazonian waters.</p>
                        <p>During the last two years, however, a company, subsidized by the
                            provincial government, has placed four American boats on the river. The
                            novelty of their build at first caused considerable surprise, but I am
                            happy to say they have given great satisfaction on account of their
                            small consumption of coal and general adaptation to river navigation, in
                            which they are far superior to boats built in Great Britain. The
                            long-enduring prejudice is at last removed, and no doubt the example of
                            this company will be followed by others in this and neighboring
                            provinces. The boats are of iron, and all were built by Messrs. Pusey,
                            Jones &amp; Co., of Wilmington, Delaware.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> In compliance with the instructions
                            contained in the circular from the Department of State, dated the 19th
                            of August last, I have the honor to submit the following facts and
                            considerations respecting the present state of commercial intercourse
                            between the United States and Mexico; the causes of the present
                            prostrate condition of American interest here, and means which might
                            probably be efficaciously employed by our Government to bring about a
                            more prosperous state of affairs.</p>
                        <p>On the 1st of August, 1869, I addressed a confidential circular to all
                            the American consuls and consular agents residing in the republic of
                            Mexico, requesting them to furnish me with data concerning the political
                            and material condition of the States in which they respectively reside.
                            Replies were received from most of these officers, and copies of several
                            interesting and valuable communications were transmitted by this
                            legation to the State Department in the closing months of 1869, and the
                            earlier portion of the present year. I respectfully suggest that a
                            collation of these documents will furnish data upon many of the points
                            covered by the Senate resolution.</p>
                        <p>As the chief practical inference from so many communications, and <pb
                                n="296" xml:id="pg_296" facs="0330"/>from my own observation,
                            experience, and inquiries, I may state that the present commercial
                            intercourse between the United States and Mexico is in a state of the
                            utmost prostration and decadence. The reports of our consuls are
                            unanimous upon this point. In this city, which is one of the largest in
                            Spanish America, the number of American mercantile houses does not
                            exceed two or three, and the total number of American residents is but a
                            score or two. The same is the case in Vera Cruz, and in the principal
                            ports of the Pacific, as well as, with greater reason, in the large
                            cities of the interior.</p>
                        <p>The commerce of importation into this republic is almost exclusively in
                            the hands of European merchants, chiefly English, French, and German.
                            The large number of citizens of the Southern States of the Union who
                            came to Mexico immediately after the rebellion, have almost all returned
                            to the United States. The agricultural colony near Cordova, from which
                            so much was expected, has been completely broken up and dispersed, and
                            there is not at this moment in Mexico a single notability remaining out
                            of the many confederate refugees. Of the few American commercial houses
                            in Mexico, the greater part import more foreign than American goods,
                            there being, I believe, but one house which deals exclusively in
                            articles of American manufacture—that is to say, in arms and ammunition.
                            On the Pacific coast our commerce via San Francisco is almost limited to
                            the vessels of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, which complains of a
                            loss of trade, and is even said to be running at a loss. The
                            importations by this line are chiefly confined to arms, and agricultural
                            and mining implements, with small quantities of hardware and Chinese
                            goods. The causes of this low state of American commerce in Mexico are
                            but too easily explained. They may be summed up as follows:</p>
                        <p>1st. The force of habit; the Europeans having preceded us in establishing
                            commercial relations here.</p>
                        <p>2d. The low rate of interest which European houses pay for their borrowed
                            capital, contrasting with that of the United States in the proportion of
                            from five to ten per centum.</p>
                        <p>3d. The fact that European manufacturers of cotton and fancy goods
                            invariably consult the Mexican taste, thus enabling them to make little
                            account of durability of material, and successfully to compete with
                            American articles of stronger texture, but of subdued colors.</p>
                        <p>4th. The chronic insecurity of life and property, which has exerted and
                            still exerts a fatal influence upon all foreign capital in the country,
                            and whose effect on Americans has been absolutely to preclude its
                            introduction.</p>
                        <p>5th. The entire want of railroad and telegraphic communication between
                            the two countries along our 1,500 miles of frontier.</p>
                        <p>In respect to the proper remedies which might be employed by the
                            Government of the United States to enable Americans gradually to assume
                            that commercial importance in Mexico to which our proximity and
                            political sympathies entitle us, they may be summed up, in general, as
                            being those measures which will most effectually operate for the removal
                            or neutralization of these five causes.</p>
                        <p>Undoubtedly, under favorable circumstances, something may be accomplished
                            diplomatically to place the commerce of the United States upon a more
                            favorable footing as toward the Mexican revenue system. By the
                            continuance of the wise policy of giving moral aid and countenance to
                            the present liberal and patriotic government of Mexico, we shall also
                            contribute to the rapid development of that energetic protection to life
                            and property which is of such urgent necessity, and which this
                            government <pb n="297" xml:id="pg_297" facs="0331"/>is doing all in its
                            power to establish. In the line of active promotion of American
                            interests in Mexico, I know of nothing more important to be consulted
                            than the facility and rapidity of intercommunication by means of railway
                            and steamship lines and telegraphs, both as between the two countries,
                            and as within the extensive Mexican territories where the almost total
                            absence of good means of communication is proverbial. However desirable
                            American colonization may be to Mexico and to our interests, it cannot
                            be effectually promoted in any other way. The construction of railways,
                            then, through the State of Texas and the Territories of New Mexico and
                            Arizona, to the Mexican frontier, is an object of the first importance
                            for the interests to which this inquiry is directed. When such roads
                            once exist to the frontier the Mexican government will undoubtedly make
                            great efforts to promote their extension through the vast States,
                            fabulously rich in mines and in agricultural wealth, of her northern
                            zone. The unfriendly legislation which, under the name of the <hi
                                rend="italic">zona libre</hi>, and other burdensome clogs upon our
                            commerce, would then naturally disappear. The growing prosperity of our
                            Southern States, and especially the gratifying progress of the port of
                            New Orleans, is destined to exert a speedy and beneficial influence upon
                            our commerce with Mexico. It is worthy of inquiry whether our Government
                            might not properly do something in aid of the reëstablishment of lines
                            of steamships from New Orleans to the Mexican ports of the Gulf.</p>
                        <p>Finally, everything which promotes a knowledge in detail of the vast but
                            undeveloped resources of the several States of Mexico will inevitably
                            exert a powerful influence for good in the desired direction. The speedy
                            construction of the Tehuantepec Railway will be an inestimable boon to
                            the increasing community of interests between the two republics. The
                            survey about to be made of that Isthmus by an expedition under the
                            auspices of the American Navy Department, will, if successful in its
                            object of establishing the feasibility of interoceanic navigation, do
                            more than anything else that could be suggested to excite in our
                            commercial houses that interest and curiosity which are the precursors
                            of enterprise. Beside giving the widest publicity to the results of that
                            survey, if favorable, might not our Government usefully undertake the
                            scientific survey of other portions of Mexican territory contiguous to
                            our own, with a view to other international public works?</p>
                        <p>The suggestion made in the closing paragraphs of the able preliminary
                            report on this subject of the Department of State, concerning a
                            congressional appropriation to employ statisticians of ability to
                            collect and collate information upon this subject, seems to me eminently
                            conducive to the attainment of important results, and, in case of its
                            adoption, I would suggest that one or more persons be detailed to the
                            special study of the subject upon Mexican soil. I have addressed a note
                            to Mr. Romero, the secretary of the treasury, requesting him to furnish
                            me certain information and statistics upon several of the matters
                            involved in this inquiry, which I hope to be able to communicate to the
                            State Department by the next steamer.</p>

                            Germany, accepted the situation adopted under de Beust, a policy of free
                            constitutional government, and devoted herself to the work of
                            reconstruction. Hungary was first reconciled, and the recent bitter
                            feuds were replaced by warm devotion, and Andrapy, proscribed in 1849,
                            is to-day its chief minister. In Cisleitha the work is still progressing
                            under difficulties of which the Department has been steadily advised,
                            and the rivalry between Prussia and Austria * * * * * * * * * had not
                            ceased with Sadowa. The non-execution of the fourth and fifth articles
                            of the treaty of Prague had not tended to establish perfect confidence;
                            the memory of the Count de Bismarck’s declaration to the Austrian
                            ambassador that Austria was an eastern and not a western power, and that
                            her capital was Pesth, and not Vienna, was not forgotton; the
                            disclosure, by General la Marmora in the Italian Chambers, of the letter
                            of the Prussian ambassador, in June 1866, declaring that it was
                            necessary to “strike the Austrian power to the heart,” had made a
                            profound impression as coming from their ancient ally, and reminders
                            were constantly supplied by the German press of the intent, still
                            cherished under color of German nationality, to strip Austria of her
                            provinces wherever Germans might be found, however few in number, from
                            her northern border to the Adriatic Sea, When Mr. Bancroft’s dispatch
                            appeared, dated at Berlin, with a reference to its colored map to prove
                            Pesth “the exact central point of the totality of the whole empire,”
                            with hints of the coming superiority of Pesth over Vienna, and with its
                            intimation that, unless the Austrian cabinet should be governed by the
                            wishes of its German subjects, it might lose its German-Austrian
                            provinces, as it lost Venice and Milan, it is not difficult to
                            understand that such a document, at a critical moment, appearing with a
                            color of American authority, was calculated to surprise rather than to
                            charm the cabinet at Vienna. I say a critical moment, for you will
                            remember that, at the date of Mr. Bancroft’s dispatch, when, to give an
                            idea of the existing state of Austria, <pb n="299" xml:id="pg_299"
                                facs="0333"/>he says that it was for the Germans to reconstruct a
                            constitution, they were oppressed with a mournful feeling of regret and
                            discontent increasing their difficulty in this work, while Cisleitha was
                            tending to decomposition, owing to the refusal of the Austrian
                            government to promote the union of Germany, and that any new policy to
                            be adopted after the fall of the Giskra ministry must arise out of a
                            sort of chaos; at this time, the actual state of things * * * * * * * *
                            * * * * * was, in its essential features, materially different.</p>
                        <p>Before the date of that dispatch, (April 18,) I had advised the
                            Department that Count Potocki, a Polish gentleman of high character and
                            large wealth, of moderate views and great respectability, had been
                            placed at the head of the ministry, and charged with the scheme of
                            reconstruction; and my dispatches No. 106 (of April 8,) No. 108, (of
                            April 16,) No. 109, (April 18,) No. 116, (April 27,) while advising you
                            minutely and exactly of the progress of things, showed that the policy
                            of the chancellor and of the Count Potocki, instead of being chaotic,
                            was clearly defined. Indeed, in my dispatch on the 8th of April, ten
                            days before Mr. Bancroft wrote, I advised you that the chancellor feared
                            no reaction against the liberal policy he had inaugurated, for, as you
                            are aware, the work of constructing a constitution for Austria, which
                            Mr. Bancroft says the Germans in their grief are going at with so little
                            heart, has been for four years steadily advancing. On this point
                            especially, at which Mr. Bancroft, by his remark that “they began well,”
                            seems to leave it to be inferred that only the beginning was well, I
                            prefer, instead of placing my own opinion in opposition to those of my
                            distinguished colleague, to quote some facts cited in the North British
                            Review for October 1869, in an article on the “Constitutional
                            Development of Austria:”</p>
                        <p>Austria at the close of 1867 was already one of the freest constitutional
                            monarchies on the continent, * * and now were added the equality of all
                            subjects before the law, the admission to public office of any capable
                            subject, the free enjoyment of property, domestic and personal liberty,
                            the liberty of the press, the inviolability of letters in the post
                            office, liberty of creeds, conscience, and science, the separation of
                            judicial from administrative functions, the independence of the judge,
                            the oath to the constitution required from all officials and their
                            responsibility for all unconstitutional measures, the right of the
                            representation of the people on all matters of taxation and military
                            conscription, the creation of an imperial parliamentary tribunal, and,
                            lastly, the enumeration in the delegation law of all the public and
                            common concerns of the different provinces and the method of their
                            treatment. * * * Austria, though far from her ideal, has, since Sadowa,
                            accomplished wonders. The regeneration of the empire, upon the bold
                            scheme of Beust, is progressing with ample strides. And it must not be
                            forgotten that it proceeds upon the natural, historical, and traditional
                            condition of the empire, verified by the modern spirit of the age. No
                            other political body of the continent keeps pace with Austria in the
                            development of its public life; she is rapidly making compensation for
                            the errors and negligences of centuries, and in her progress are to be
                            found the germs of the political revival of the nations of Central
                            Europe.</p>
                        <p>In the same letter of the 10th of May, I said that Count de Beust hoped
                            to satisfy the nationalities whose opposing demands had created so much
                            trouble, by constitutional amendments in the direction of a federative
                            system, which, while increasing the extent of self-government in the
                            provinces, and recognizing to a greater extent the autonomy of Gallicia
                            and Bohemia, will attach them more closely to the empire and increase
                            the national strength of the imperial government.</p>
                        <p>On the 16th of April, still before the date of Mr. Bancroft’s dispatch,
                            you were advised of the unavailing character of the efforts which had
                            been made to induce the German federalists to enter the ministry, headed
                            by the Count Potocki; that Hungary had protested against a continuance
                            of ministerial crises as detrimental to the dual empire; and <pb n="300"
                                xml:id="pg_300" facs="0334"/>that the Emperor had resolved to devote
                            himself to the work of conciliation, and remain in Vienna until the
                            autumn. I then described the situation of the new ministry as one
                            unusually complicated, delicate, and difficult, and remarked: “It now
                            looks as if the coming election will be perhaps the most important that
                            has ever occurred in the empire, as exercising a decisive influence upon
                            constitutional questions of first-class importance. All parties,
                            according to the Viennese journals, appreciate the significance of the
                            situation, and are preparing to open the electoral campaign with
                            manifestation and reunions, and thus the empire seems to take an onward
                            step in the progress of constitutional and popular governments.”</p>
                        <p>That dispatch referred at its close to the idea, which had been thrown
                            out, that the federal programme would result in the overthrow of German
                            civilization, and stated that the idea of such danger from the extension
                            of political rights and means of education in their own language to
                            other races, was ridiculed by some of the Viennese papers, including the
                            Press and the Wanderer.</p>
                        <p>The next Vienna dispatch (107) on the political situation was dated
                            curiously enough on the very same day, April 18, with that from Berlin;
                            and the difference in their advice is sufficiently startling. It advised
                            the government that the Polish head of the ministry, Count Potocki, a
                            warm admirer of our republic, of its schools and its finances, had
                            declared that the principal changes which he proposed to introduce were
                            borrowed from the American Constitution.</p>
                        <p>The Vienna dispatch announced a programme of reconstruction, based upon
                            the American Constitution, to be submitted by a Polish minister to a
                            Reichsrath to be elected for the purpose by the people, and to the
                            importance of whose election the people were alive.</p>
                        <p>The Berlin dispatch announced that the Germans had to do the work of
                            reconstruction; that they were to do it with sad hearts; that any new
                            policy that might be adopted “must arise out of a sort of chaos;” that
                            “the distraction seemed hopeless,” and that unless the government
                            adopted the policy recommended in the dispatch, as approved at Berlin,
                            it might expect to lose the Austro-German provinces. * * * When Mr.
                            Bancroft charges the government of Cisleytha with seeking to impede the
                            union of the rest of Germany, he ignores three important facts: 1st.
                            That, by the treaty of Prague, Prussia had consented with Austria that
                            there should be formed a South German Confederation, so that by the law
                            of the situation Prussia had no right to demand a unification of the
                            whole of Germany. 2d. That Count de Beust had distinctly, in his
                            dispatch to the Austrian ministers at Munich and Stuttgard, disavowed
                            all interference with the question, whatever their wishes on the
                            subject. 3d. That it was the government at Berlin and not that at Vienna
                            which presented obstacles to the union. Würtemberg, for instance, having
                            declared her conviction in 1867 that “the North German Confederation
                            does not offer the necessary guarantees for the enjoyment of civil
                            rights and the progress of liberty;” yet notwithstanding treaty
                            stipulations, notwithstanding Austria’s non-interference, however strong
                            her interests or her rights; notwithstanding the substantial reasons
                            assigned by the southern states themselves, Mr. Bancroft declares that
                            unless Austria reconciles herself to the idea of an united Germany, she
                            may expect to be deprived of her German provinces. It is quite true that
                            there is nothing in the least degree novel in the suggestions
                            themselves.</p>
                        <p>Similar threats of spoilation had been already hinted at in diplomacy and
                            openly uttered by the press. Take, for example, a pamphlet entitled <pb
                                n="301" xml:id="pg_301" facs="0335"/>“Der Zerfall Oesterreichs,” von
                            einem Deutsch-Oesterreicher, “The Decay of Austria,” by a
                            German-Austrian, published at Leipsic in 1867. This writer, whose views
                            and language in the following passage are not in discord with that of
                            Mr. Bancroft, and who uses the same illustration of Venetia, says: “The
                            unified German state (Einheitsstaat) can only then be consolidated when
                            it shall include all the German provinces of Austria, like as the
                            consolidation of the Italian unified state required the possession of
                            Venetia.” Among these German provinces that are to be thus snatched from
                            Austria, this writer includes Bohemia and Moravia. He declares that the
                            Germans will never consent to give up these countries; and he declares
                            further that it is imperatively necessary that the German empire should
                            extend to the Adriatic, and include <hi rend="italic">Trieste and
                                Istria!</hi></p>
                        <p>Another German writer, Von Wolfgang Menzel, the author of “Der deutsche
                            Krieg im Jahr 1866, (“The German war in 1866,”) says quite as
                            distinctly: “A mere glance at the map will show that Bohemia is German
                            land, which the great German nation, at no price, can part with. Its
                            inhabitants are partly Germans and partly Germanized slaves. And merely
                            to gratify a small remnant of Czechisch barbarians,* <note n="*"

                                    the entire area 64 per cent. belongs to the Czechs and 36 to the

                                    Westminster Review for July 1870. Ninety-seven per cent. of the
                                    children in Bohemia attend school. The Czechs in Bohemia and
                                    Moravia have twenty-two political newspapers, two-thirds being
                                    daily, three illustrated weekly papers, seven journals and

                                    periodical publications to a total of seventy-one. The same
                                    review mentions, as not devoid of interest, that four newspapers
                                    in the Czechish language are published in the United States.</p>
                                <p>The investigations of Dr. A. Weisbach on “the weight of the
                                    brains of the different peoples in Austria” show the Czechs to
                                    have larger and heavier brains, particularly in the upper and
                                    frontal regions, than the Germans or any other of the Austrian
                                    nations.</p>
                                <p>Mr. Bancroft says, (on page 5 of his dispatch,) after discussing
                                    the reconstruction of Hungary in regard to Cisleythanian
                                    Austria, (the other duality of the Austro-Hungarian dominions,)
                                    “here the Germans were to play the same part as the Magyars in
                                    Hungary,” and it is upon this assumption that his argument
                                    proceeds, although he admits that they constitute “but about
                                    one-third of the whole population of Cisleytha.”</p>
                                <p>The able and thoroughly advised author of the paper in the North
                                    British Review for July 1870, entitled “The Cisleythan
                                    Constitutional Crisis,” (pp. 493 and 494,) remarks, in a passage
                                    that directly answers the assertion:</p>
                                <p>“In Hungary this problem (that of determining the exact limits
                                    between the autonomy of the provinces and the prerogatives of
                                    the ruling powers) has not been solved, it is only less
                                    prominent. The constitution of 1848 grants the Magyars a
                                    predominance, and the annexed provinces are weak in proportion
                                    to the energy and recklessness with which the dominant nation
                                    enforces its privileges. <hi rend="italic">But in the Cisleythan
                                        part of the empire there is no such predominance of a single
                                        nationality</hi>, and not only the constitution of December
                                    1867, but also the previous one of February, is based on the
                                    principle of equality, and the largest possible autonomy of the
                                    single provinces.”</p></note> who have not yet learned German
                            and are wanting in every element of culture, this important country will
                            never be given up;” and he proceeds to show, with the same blending of
                            fondness for the Hungarians with displeasure at the Austrians, which is
                            also conspicuous in Mr. Bancroft’s dispatch, that in this spoliation of
                            Austria there is “for Germans and Hungarians but one and the same
                            interest.” * * * What is to be the fate of this ancient monarchy,
                            whether it is to be dominated, by Panslavism under the lead of Russia on
                            the one hand, or whether it is to be absorbed in great part by the
                            military power of an united Germany on the other, or whether, escaping
                            these dangers, it will be able to succeed in the difficult task “of
                            satisfying its various nationalities and consolidating them,<pb n="302"
                                xml:id="pg_302" facs="0336"/>with all their differences of race,
                            language, and religion, into a harmonious empire,” no man can foresee.
                            The effect of the war now commencing upon the destinies of Europe is
                            equally unknown, and no one can say if Austria will be able to rest in
                            her present position of neutrality, or whether she will be called upon
                            to ally herself with France to protect her Austro-Germanic provinces
                            from the German absorption, which Mr. Bancroft intimates is all but
                            inevitable, unless the cabinet of Vienna will consent to be guided by
                            Berlin.</p>
                        <p>But whatever the future may bring to light, the Austrian government is
                            now developing a system of constitutional government and popular freedom
                            which, while it encounters sneers and dislikes on the part of the
                            military despotisms of Europe, entitles it certainly to the respectful
                            consideration of the Government at Washington, especially at a moment
                            when it proposes to base the empire on federative principles, akin to
                            those embodied in the American Constitution, and when, in its extension
                            of popular freedom, it borrows its inspiration from the American people.

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> Mr. Amunateque, minister of foreign
                            relations of this republic, has explained to me to-day why a minister
                            has not been sent to Washington. He informs me that the elections alone
                            have prevented the departure of the minister; that it was impossible to
                            spare a single man of importance, as this election, which has been for
                            senators and congressmen, will decide the next presidential election.
                            The contest is now over, and the next steamer will no doubt take out the
                            new minister.</p>
                        <p>The opposition to the government in the late election has been most
                            determined and successful, and although the government party will be
                            largely in the majority, yet the opposition or radical party has gained
                            over twenty members, and among them the most talented men of the
                            republic. The church party has elected but nine in the house and five in
                            the senate.</p>
                        <p>In view of the fact that questions of reform in the imperfect
                            constitution of Chili are to be decided, this triumph of the progressive
                            and radically liberal party of the country will result, I have no doubt,
                            in much good; and from the fact that decisions of the Catholic council
                            now in Rome will also be discussed before this congress, as the church
                            in all the Spanish-American republics has ever been considered equal to
                            the state, I also rejoice at the defeat that the church party has
                            sustained.</p>
                        <p>The only great drawback to the onward progress of this spiritual little
                            republic is the upas-like influence and power of the church, and I have
                            reasons to hope that the late elections will have for their result not
                            only a lessening of the clerical power, but a complete and final
                            separation of church and state.</p>
                        <p>I would not have you infer from what I have said that the government <pb
                                n="303" xml:id="pg_303" facs="0337"/>of President Pérez is
                            tyrannical or even illiberal; upon the contrary, I believe that the most
                            perfect liberty now exists in Chili under the existing laws, but the
                            laws are bad; also, so far as I can learn, the elections have been fair
                            and the government has lost, when it could have gained everywhere had
                            the president and his cabinet but taken those measures that the
                            illiberal, bad elective laws of the land permit. To the honor of this
                            just president and the members of his honorable cabinet be it said they
                            have not done so. It is not because I love the party now in power (which
                            is conservative) less, but because I love the principles of the
                            triumphant party (which is radical) more, that I am pleased with the
                            result of the recent elections in this country.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: It was deemed advisable last summer to
                            acquaint Mr. Bancroft, in anticipation of the arrival of the Chinese
                            mission at Berlin, with the views of the present administration
                            concerning the policy to be pursued toward China. As these instructions
                            contain the substance of most that it is necessary to say to you before
                            you sail to your post, I inclose a copy of them herewith and invite your
                            special attention to them.</p>
                        <p>You will observe that the President adheres to the policy adopted in
                            1868, when the articles additional to the treaty of 1858 (commonly known
                            as the Burlingame treaty) were concluded. You will, therefore, so shape
                            your private as well as your official conversation as to demonstrate to
                            Prince Kung the sincerity of the United States in its wishes for the
                            maintenance of the authority of the central government and for the
                            peaceful spread of its influence. You will make clear to the government
                            to which you are accredited the settled purpose of the President to
                            observe with fidelity all the treaty obligations of the United States
                            and to respect the prejudices and traditions of the people of China when
                            they do not interfere with rights which have been acquired to the United
                            States by treaty. On the other hand you will not fail to make it
                            distinctly understood that he will claim the full performance, by the
                            Chinese government, of all the promises and obligations which it has
                            assumed by treaties or conventions with the United States. On this
                            point, and in the maintenance of our existing rights to their full
                            extent, you will be always firm and decisive. While you will put forward
                            these claims where occasion requires, with prudence and moderation, you
                            will be unyielding in demanding the extreme protection to American
                            citizens, commerce, and property which is conceded by the treaties, and
                            in requiring the full recognition of your own official position to which
                            you are entitled.</p>
                        <p>The instructions to Mr. Bancroft set forth so fully the policy of the
                            United States toward China, the ends to be accomplished there, and the
                            peaceful spirit which is to animate your mission, that I content myself
                            with again referring you to them for your guidance in those
                            respects.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> Referring again to your dispatch No.
                                8, of the 4th of May last, I propose to give briefly the views of
                                the Department as to the policy to be pursued toward China.</p>
                            <p>I am induced to do this mainly because the chargé d’affaires of North
                                Germany has, under instructions from his government, inquired of me
                                whether the President still adheres to the principles established by
                                the additional articles to the treaty of June 18, 1858, which were
                                concluded July 28, 1868. That government has, on several occasions,
                                manifested a desire to harmonize its policy with ours in the
                                Pacific. While I have freely communicated to Mr. Krause the views
                                which we entertain, and have gone so far as to read to him copious
                                extracts from the communications of Mr. Browne and Mr. George Seward
                                from China, I thought as you are soon to meet Mr. Burlingame and his
                                colleagues, it may be well to give you a little more in detail the
                                views of the President on this question. The great principle which
                                underlies the articles of July 1868 is the recognition of the
                                sovereign authority of the imperial government at Pekin over the
                                people of the Chinese empire and over their social, commercial, and
                                political relations with the western powers. Although it is true
                                that many of the Christian governments, including the United States,
                                had before then concluded treaties with the imperial government, yet
                                it is scarely exaggeration to say that their relations at that time
                                were rather those of force than of amity.</p>
                            <p>The commercial foothold along the coast had been gained by conflict
                                or by demonstrations of force, and were held in the same way. The
                                occupation which, originally hostile, had become commercial—and so
                                far friendly as the relations of commerce demanded a show of
                                amity—aimed in the commencement, with some European settlers, at
                                territorial acquisition; but this tendency had been checked by the
                                rivalry of different nationalities, until the foreign jurisdiction,
                                more by the tacit consent of the foreigners than from any active
                                power exercised by the Chinese, had become limited to the essential
                                matters of the municipal government of the communities of Europeans
                                and the exercise of jurisdiction over their persons and properties.
                                The communication between China and the outside world was merely
                                confined to the trading points. With the intellects that rule that
                                nation of four hundred and fifty millions of people, with the men
                                who gave it its ideas and directed its policy, with its vast
                                internal industries, with its great agricultural population, the
                                traders, consuls, and functionaries of the ports rarely came in
                                contact except in the contact of war. The European-Chinese policy
                                was one of isolation, inasmuch as it only sought the development of
                                a foreign trade at certain particular ports, and of disintegration,
                                as it practically ignored the central government and made war upon
                                the provinces to redress its grievances and to enforce its
                                demands.</p>
                            <p>It is true, indeed, that by the treaty of Tien-tsin, in 1858, the
                                privilege was secured to the United States and the European powers
                                to maintain legations at Pekin, and that for the ten years that
                                followed diplomatic representatives resided there. It is also true
                                that from that residence and the contact with the higher Chinese
                                officials there has come a better knowledge of the Chinese nation,
                                and of the relation between its people and its government; but it is
                                none the less true that those treaties closed a war which resulted
                                disastrously to China; that before their ratifications could be
                                exchanged another war became necessary to enforce them; that the
                                concessions they contained were forced from the imperial government;
                                that the new policy was not favored by the Chinese statesmen; that
                                it did not measurably increase the personal intercourse between the
                                natives and the Europeans; and that many of the wisest of the
                                Chinese rulers honestly dreaded any increase in such intercourse, as
                                tending to the introduction in China of the labor-saving machines of
                                the west, which, in their judgment, would throw multitudes of people
                                in their thickly-settled country out of employment, reduce them to
                                beggary and starvation, and inflict irreparable woes on China. For
                                an able and temperate statement of these views by a person who is
                                described by Mr. Browne as a man “of acknowledged ability and
                                commanding influence,” “who is regarded as the most enlightened
                                statesman of the empire,” I refer you to the remarkable inclosure,
                                marked No. 1, which I shall subsequently allude to further To say
                                that such views are fallacious and obsolete; that they are confuted
                                by the experience of western nations like England and Belgium, which
                                have as great a population to the square mile as China; that they
                                are opposed to all sound theories of political economy, does not
                                meet the case. The facts remain that they did at one time control
                                the policy of China, and that they are still adhered to by many of
                                her leading statesmen; and in dealing with this question these facts
                                must not be lost sight of.</p>
                            <p>The treaty negotiated by Mr. Burlingame and his colleagues was along
                                step in another direction. It came voluntarily from China, and
                                placed that power in theory on the same diplomatic footing with the
                                nations of the western world. It recognizes the imperial government
                                as the power to withhold or to grant further commercial <pb n="305"
                                    xml:id="pg_305" facs="0339"/>privileges, and also as the power
                                whose duty it is to enforce the peaceful enjoyment of the rights
                                already conferred.</p>
                            <p>While it confirms the interterritorial jurisdiction conferred by
                                former treaties upon European and American functionaries over the
                                persons and properties of their countrymen, it recognizes at the
                                same time the territorial integrity of China, and prevents such a
                                jurisdiction from being stretched beyond its original purpose. While
                                it leaves in China the sovereign power of granting to foreigners
                                hereafter the right to construct lines of railroads and telegraphs,
                                of opening mines, of navigating the rivers of the empire with
                                steamers, and of otherwise increasing the outlets for its wealth, by
                                the use of the appliances of western civilization, it contemplates
                                that China shall avail herself of these appliances by reasonable
                                concessions, to be made as public necessities and the power of the
                                government to influence public opinion will permit. This treaty has
                                not yet been ratified by the imperial government, and I am informed
                                by Mr. Browne that Prince Kung “deems it advisable to defer the
                                exchange of ratifications till the return of the Chinese
                                plenipotentiaries.” Mr. Browne does not “infer any slight to our
                                government from this delay, or any want of appreciation of its
                                friendship,” and he thinks that “the true cause of the delay may be
                                found in the peculiar attitude of China toward all the treaty
                                powers.” “When the government of China,” he adds, “is satisfied that
                                it will not be injurious to its interests to accept these articles,
                                it will do so.”</p>
                            <p>The President has been disposed to view this matter in the same
                                light, and, therefore, has not pressed for a ratification, feeling
                                confident that, as the treaty is so much in the interest of China,
                                the statesmen of that empire must inevitably see the propriety of
                                authorizing the ratification to be exchanged. Rumors reach us by
                                telegraph from Hong-Kong, by. way of London, that the imperial
                                government have decided not to ratify this treaty, but we are not
                                inclined to credit them, as they are opposed to the general tenor of
                                our information. Some things have taken place, however, which,
                                regarded by themselves, tend to lead us to the conclusion that it is
                                possible that China may reverse her policy; and in order that you
                                may have full information on this subject, it is proper that I
                                should briefly state them.</p>
                            <p>Not long after the treaties of Tien-tsin, what is known as the
                                coöperative policy of the great powers in China began; I think this
                                dates from about the year 1863, but it is immaterial for my present
                                purpose whether it began earlier or later. Under this policy,
                                favored by the fact that most or all of the treaties with the
                                western powers contained the most favored-nation clause, the
                                Christian communities of all nationalities in China have been
                                regarded as having a common political as well as commercial
                                interest, to be pursued under joint counsels, and it has followed
                                from this, that in important matters the Chinese officials have been
                                made to see, sometimes even with a show of ostentation, that there
                                was a substantial unity of design among all the powers. The
                                apprehension has been expressed lest the operation of the eighth
                                article of the treaty of July should put a stop to this coöperative
                                policy; and I am bound to say, that so far as that policy was
                                aggressive and attempted to force upon China measures which could
                                not be enforced upon a European or American state by the rules of
                                the equitable code which regulates the intercourse of civilized
                                nations, in my judgement, that article may, when ratifications are
                                exchanged, prevent the United States from participating in such a
                                policy.</p>
                            <p>The question becomes a practical one from the fact that the revision
                                of the British treaty of 1858 is under consideration. The
                                twenty-seventh article of that treaty provided that either party
                                might “demand a further revision of the tariff and of the commercial
                                articles of the treaty at the end of ten years: but if no demand be
                                made on either side within six months after the end of the first ten
                                years, then the tariff shall remain in force for ten years more,
                                reckoned from the end of the preceding ten years.”</p>
                            <p>The thirtieth article of the treaty between China and the United
                                States, of 1858, provides that “should at any time the Ta-Tsing
                                empire grant to any nation, or the merchants or citizens of any
                                nation, any right, privilege, or favor connected either with
                                navigation, commerce, political and other intercourse, which is not
                                conferred by this treaty, such right, privilege, or favor shall at
                                once inure to the benefit of the United States, its public officers,
                                merchants, and citizens.” Thus the United States became directly
                                interested in the revision of the British concessions.</p>
                            <p>It being well understood that Great Britain would, when the time
                                came, demand, among other things, the right to navigate the interior
                                waters of the empire with steam, the right to construct and to hire
                                warehouses in the interior for the storage of goods, and the right
                                to work coal mines, the government at Pekin, on the 12th of October,
                                1867, took steps to get information from the different parts of the
                                empire upon the subject of the revision. Among others,
                                Tsang-Kwohfan, acting governor of the provinces of Kiangru,
                                Nganhioui, and Kiangri, “a man over 70 years of age and of
                                distinguished reputation throughout the empire,” received these
                                instructions, and made, in answer to them, the able report, to the
                                copy of which, herewith inclosed, marked No. 1, I have already
                                called your attention.</p>
                            <p>Though the work of a conservative mind that clings to the traditions
                                of the past, <pb n="306" xml:id="pg_306" facs="0340"/>and sees few
                                good results in change, it is moderate and temperate, and must be
                                conceded to be, from the Chinese standpoint, a not unwise view of
                                the subject. With all its conservatism it is easy to trace in it the
                                enlarging and modifying influences of contact with the west.</p>
                            <p>In substance, however, it recommends the Emperor’s advisers not to
                                grant the important new concessions asked for by the government of
                                Great Britain.</p>
                            <p>In November last the expected demands were made on the part of Great
                                Britain by Sir Rutherford Alcock, in a personal interview with
                                Prince Kung and some of the other ministers. They were made in
                                strong language, as necessary to the proper enjoyment of the rights
                                conceded by the treaty of 1858, and the Chinese government was
                                warned in advance of the probable course Great Britain would pursue
                                in case of refusal. The American minister gave Sir Rutherford Alcock
                                the support of his presence at the interview, and afterward received
                                from Sir Rutherford full copies of an account of it, which was drawn
                                up in the British legation and transmitted to Prince Kung. I
                                inclose, marked No. 2 and No. 3, copies of these documents.</p>
                            <p>Prince Kung, on his part, soon replied in a dignified and moderate
                                way to the peremptory demands of Sir Rutherford Alcock. He admitted
                                the substantial accuracy of Sir Rutherford’s account of the
                                interview. He said that China and Great Britain could not be coerced
                                into a similarity, neither could either wholly adopt the usages of
                                the other. He deprecated the entire submission of China to the
                                demands of the foreign merchants. He denied that there had been
                                willful violations of the treaty. He stated, in detail, many points
                                in which China is prepared to make concessions, which will, he
                                thinks, give to the foreign merchants all they ought to ask. But to
                                admit steamers on the interior lakes and rivers, to establish hongs,
                                and to carry on mining operations in the interior, will, in the
                                judgment of the prince, be so distasteful to the people that it will
                                be impracticable for the government to attempt to carry out the
                                terms of such a concession should it be made; and Great Britain, in
                                that case, would have just cause to upbraid China for bad faith.</p>
                            <p>To the representation that these concessions would be beneficial to
                                China, the prince replies that a good physician ascertains the
                                condition of his patient before deciding on the remedies, and
                                intimates that he knows the condition of China better than Sir
                                Rutherford Alcock does; and he closes by furnishing the British
                                envoy with a memorandum of the basis for a revision which will be
                                acceptable to the Chinese government. I inclose copies of these
                                papers, marked No. 4 and No. 6.</p>
                            <p>As Mr. Browne had, in pursuance of the cooperative policy, interfered
                                personally and in writing (see inclosure No. 5) on behalf of the
                                British claim for a revision, Prince Kung, about the same time,
                                addressed a note to him, of which I inclose a copy, (No. 7.)</p>
                            <p>The basis for a revision, which was proposed by the Chinese
                                government, conceded the opening of landing stages on the Yangtse at
                                points to be agreed upon; the working of mines in the vicinity of
                                one or more of the treaty ports; the right of inland navigation by
                                vessels not propelled by steam, this restriction to cease when
                                Chinese use vessels propelled by steam; a steam-tug on the Poyang
                                Lake; and the free right to travel throughout the land, and to hire
                                lodgings and accommodations for produce or goods.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Ross Browne, who sympathized and coöperated with the British
                                minister throughout the negotiations, appears to think that the
                                points gained may become of importance as a starting point for
                                negotiations hereafter. I inclose you a copy of his letter to Sir
                                Rutherford Alcock on the subject, (No. 8.)</p>
                            <p>The British minister at Washington, on the 9th day of June last,
                                notified the United States of the decision of her Majesty’s
                                government on this subject, by which it would appear that they have
                                decided to accept the situation and wait quietly the operation of
                                the causes which are working in the Chinese mind. I inclose (marked
                                No. 9) a copy of an extract from a letter from the board of trade,
                                which has been sent to Sir Rutherford Alcock for his guidance. Such
                                course strikes me as wiser than the more vigorous policy which Sir
                                Rutherford Alcock seems to have contemplated. The points gained may
                                not be as important as could be desired, yet they have been gained
                                peaceably, by negotiation, and are yielded by China as a right
                                flowing legitimately and necessarily from former treaties.</p>
                            <p>It certainly looks, on the face of this correspondence, as if the
                                conduct of the Emperor’s ministers had been inspired from the first
                                by a sense of duty, by a desire to observe good faith toward the
                                western powers, and by a willingness to extend commercial relations
                                with those powers, when they felt that they could do so without
                                prejudice to their own position and without injury to the people
                                whose government was intrusted to them.</p>
                            <p>I will not dwell upon the obvious difficulty of inoculating new ideas
                                upon such a people, nor upon the evident fact that intelligent
                                statesmen like Prince Kung and his associates, measure those
                                difficulties quite up to their full value.</p>
                            <p>Every consideration, from whatever point of view, leads me to believe
                                that it is neither wise nor just to force the Emperor’s advisers
                                into a position of hostility so long as we have cause to think that
                                they are willing to accept the present situation, and to <pb n="307"
                                    xml:id="pg_307" facs="0341"/>march forward, although with the
                                prudence taught them by a Chinese education. You will undoubtedly
                                meet Mr. Burlingame and his associates in Berlin. You will, if you
                                please, ascertain from him whether he has definite information as to
                                the intentions of the ministry at Pekin. Unless it shall appear that
                                they have already decided not to ratify the treaty of 1868, or
                                unless you shall be satisfied that such will be their decision, and
                                that the policy inaugurated by Mr. Burlingame is to be reversed, you
                                will render him and his associates whatever assistance you can, in
                                securing the coöperation of North Germany in the new Chinese policy.
                                You will also doubtless have an opportunity to impress upon Mr.
                                Burlingame the importance to China of an early ratification of the
                                treaties. I have stated already that the President has no solicitude
                                as to the purpose of the Emperor’s advisers in that respect. But he
                                thinks it would be well to have defined in a permanent law, as soon
                                as possible, the relations that are hereafter to exist between the
                                United States and China.</p>
                            <p>Many considerations call for this beside those which may be deduced
                                from what has gone before in this instruction. Every month brings
                                thousands of Chinese emigrants to the Pacific coast. Already they
                                have crossed the great mountains, and are beginning to be found in
                                the interior of the continent. By their assiduity, patience, and
                                fidelity, and by their intelligence, they earn the good will and
                                confidence of those who employ them. We have good reason to think
                                that this thing will continue and increase. On the other hand, in
                                China there will be an increase in the resident American and
                                European population, not by any means commensurate with the growth
                                of the Chinese emigration to this country, but corresponding with
                                the growth of our country, with the development of its resources on
                                the Pacific slope, and with the new position in the commerce of the
                                world which it takes with the completion of the Pacific Railroad.
                                These foreigners settling in China, occupying the various quarters
                                assigned to them, exercising municipal rights over these quarters by
                                virtue of land regulations, either made by them or for them, by
                                their home governments, cease to be an aggressive element in China,
                                when once the principles of the treaty of July 1868 are promulgated
                                as the law hereafter to regulate the relations between Christendom
                                and that ancient empire. You will also say to Mr. Burlingame that,
                                while the President cordially gives his adhesion to the principles
                                of the treaty of 1868, and while he will, should that instrument be
                                ratified by China, cause it to be faithfully observed by the United
                                States, yet he earnestly hopes that the advisers of his Majesty the
                                Emperor may soon see their way clear to counsel the granting of some
                                concessions similar to those asked for by Sir Rutherford Alcock and
                                Mr. Ross Browne. He will not assume to judge whether the temper of
                                the people of China will or will not at present justify their rulers
                                in doing so; but he thinks that he may, without impropriety, say,
                                that when it can be done without disturbing the good order of the
                                empire, the results must be eminently favorable to the welfare and
                                well-being of the Chinese people. And he trusts that the statesmen
                                of China, enlightened by the experience of other nations, will
                                hasten at the earliest moment, when in their judgment it can safely
                                be done, to respond to the friendly feeling and good wishes of the
                                United States by moderating the restrictions which fetter the
                                commerce of the great empire over whose destinies they preside. He
                                relies upon Mr. Burlingame and his associates to impress upon their
                                chiefs at home that the views of such men as Tsang Kevohfan, however
                                honest, are delusive; that experience, patent before them in every
                                country through which they travel, has shown them that the evils
                                which seem to be dreaded by the oriental rulers do not follow the
                                free use of steam and of the telegraph; but that, while these
                                inventions improve the condition of all ranks in the community which
                                uses them, their greatest meliorating influence is. felt among the
                                laboring classes.</p>

                                        &amp;c., of Kiangsu, relating to proposed revision of the
                                        treaties</hi></head>
                                <p>Tsang, the acting governor general of the provinces of Kiangsu,
                                    Nganhwui, and Kiangsi, reports to the throne that, in obedience
                                    to the imperial will requiring previous consultations as to the
                                    points to be attended to in revising the treaties, he now
                                    reverently incloses a secret statement, upon which he humbly
                                    begs the sacred glance.</p>
                                <p>On the 20th of October last, I was honored by a secret dispatch
                                    from the general council, stating that on the 12th of that month
                                    the following decree had been received by the board:</p>
                                <p>“The Foreign Office has memorialized the throne respecting the
                                    desirableness of previous consultations upon revising the
                                    treaties, and requested that orders might be sent to the high
                                    military and civil officers, in whose jurisdiction are situated
                                    the coast and river ports open to foreign trade, requiring each
                                    of them to send in his views, [upon the points specified.]</p>
                                <p>“The period of ten years, at the end of which the treaties are to
                                    be revised, being near its close, the Foreign Office sent up a
                                    request that orders might be sent to the two superintendents of
                                    trade for the northern and southern ports, to select from among
                                    their ablest and experienced officers two persons to bring these
                                    several reports to Pekin in November. We accordingly gave orders
                                    at the time to the proper officers to carry it into effect. But
                                    that memorial proposed that when these deputed messengers had
                                    brought up all the plans and careful suggestions, [of the
                                    provincial officers,] their deliberation must await our decision
                                    in view of the exigencies of the whole question.</p>
                                <p>“The month of January 1868, being six months before the
                                    expiration of the British treaty, is the time when notice must
                                    be given of its revision; and the reports of all the civil and
                                    military provincial functionaries ought without fail to reach
                                    Pekin by December 1867. Then, when the several confidential
                                    orders from the Foreign Office respecting the articles to be
                                    discussed have reached their addresses, let the officers all
                                    examine this matter, in view of what the times require and our
                                    resources allow, so that everything be completely arranged, and
                                    a careful memorial be reported in reply. We shall thus be
                                    assisted in meeting the difficulties of the occasion, and they
                                    will fulfill the purpose of their offices. Respect this.”</p>
                                <p>From this I am led to look up to his Majesty’s far-reaching
                                    plans, by which he thus obtains the views and conclusions of the
                                    experienced and talented among his officers, and I have
                                    endeavored in the sincerest manner to carry out the design. The
                                    first dispatch and the secret letter from the Foreign Office
                                    have both been carefully considered in every point. The design
                                    is to firmly maintain our own views, without hazarding the
                                    safety of the present situation, connected with the desire to
                                    wipe out our shame and redress our wrongs without giving those
                                    parties reason to suspect our plans. A scheme like this is
                                    really doing what the times require and our resources allow, and
                                    I leave most painfully labored to carry out the duties committed
                                    to me.</p>
                                <p>In order to aid in the consultations respecting the revision of
                                    the treaties, as soon as I received the confidential letter from
                                    the foreign office, in May, I sent directions to the collectors
                                    of each custom-house to make careful inquiries, arranging their
                                    reports under various heads. I myself most carefully examined
                                    them, and added notes as needed, and then forwarded them from
                                    Shanghai on the 18th of September, by the expectant intendant,
                                    Sun Sz’tah, and another deputy, to be thoroughly sifted and
                                    collated at Pekin.</p>
                                <p>In respect to the various points touched upon in the decree which
                                    I have now received, I humbly beg to suggest that in all our
                                    intercourse with foreign nations the most important things to be
                                    regarded are <hi rend="italic">good faith</hi> and what is <hi
                                        rend="italic">right</hi>, and perhaps even above these
                                    should be placed <hi rend="italic">decision.</hi> Those things
                                    which we cannot yield should, from first to last, be firmly
                                    declared, and not retracted under any circumstances; but those
                                    privileges which we can liberally yield might be made known to
                                    them in direct and plain terms. Let our words be maintained when
                                    once spoken, and let no alternate concession and refusal be
                                    exhibited, which by its aspect of indicision and weakness will
                                    only open the door for the wily propositions and arguments of
                                    the other party.</p>
                                <p>It may be said in general that, during many centuries past, the
                                    inhabitants in western lands have been striving to encroach on
                                    each other’s kingdoms; and in every case one has tried to
                                    possess itself of the profits of the other’s trade, as a
                                    preliminary to getting hold of its territory. They have
                                    established places of business throughout China, and trafficked
                                    or become carriers in all kinds of produce, simply that they may
                                    carry out their unscrupulous schemes of injury, which will end
                                    in depriving our merchants of their means of livelihood.</p>
                                <p>Since the time when we raised troops against them, our people
                                    have long suffered every grievous calamity. If we now open three
                                    or five more ports to their trade, and the entire length of the
                                    Yangtse River, it will daily add to the distress and indigence
                                    of our poor people, who, alas! are now nearly quite driven to
                                    the wall.</p>
                                <pb n="309" xml:id="pg_309" facs="0343"/>
                                <p>If we listen to the proposal of the foreigners to open the trade
                                    in salt, our own trade in and transportation of the article will
                                    presently be brought to nought. If we consent to their scheme of
                                    building warehouses, [in the country,] the occupation of those
                                    who now keep the inns and depots will likewise suffer. Their
                                    demand to have their small steamers allowed access to our rivers
                                    will involve the ruin of our large and small boats, and the
                                    beggary of sailors and supercargoes. So, also, if we allow them
                                    to construct railroads and set up telegraph lines, the
                                    livelihood of our cartmen, muleteers, innkeepers, and porters
                                    will be taken from them.</p>
                                <p>Among all the various demands which they make, however, that of
                                    opening coal mines should be excepted; for by working mines in
                                    the foreign way, and employing machinery, our own country would
                                    be permanently benefited, and it appears to me therefore, worthy
                                    of a trial. The suggestions of Ying Pau-Shi (now intendant at
                                    Shanghai) upon this point, in his minutes, seem to be feasible,
                                    and I have marked some notes upon it in approval.</p>
                                <p>In regard to the two proposals of steamers going up all our
                                    rivers, and of building railroads, if foreigners are allowed to
                                    carry them on, the profits and advantages of our own country
                                    will gradually be carried off to other lands; and even if our
                                    own subjects join such enterprises, and get foreigners to
                                    conduct them, the rich and the strong will then engross the
                                    labor of the poor. Neither of them, therefore, are
                                    admissible.</p>
                                <p>In explanation of these points I have already forwarded my own
                                    observations, in the dispatches sent in care of Sun Sz’tah and
                                    his colleague, in which I have discussed each clearly in the
                                    interest of the thrift and livelihood of our own people,
                                    fortifying my positions with such arguments as cannot be
                                    gainsaid. If, however, the foreigners press for their adoption
                                    unceasingly, it will be desirable to let them know that even if
                                    they should be able to force the authorities at Pekin to
                                    consent, the provincial rulers, like; myself and others, would
                                    still resist their introduction with all our strength; and if,
                                    by some means, we, too, should be compelled to give our consent,
                                    there would still remain the myriads of common people, who, in
                                    the extremity of their poverty, would see how they could better
                                    themselves, and rise to oppose the foreigners in a manner that
                                    all the authorities in China could not curb or repress. The
                                    princes and magnates of the middle kingdom need have no lack of
                                    argument in pleading for the lives of their people; and even if
                                    our course should bring about a rupture, and we resort to force
                                    to preserve the rights and employments of our people, the
                                    struggle would not be owing to a mere empty discussion on things
                                    of no importance. On the one hand, we could appeal to Heaven,
                                    earth, and our sainted emperors, and on the other to the
                                    inhabitants dwelling within every sea, [for the justice of our
                                    cause.] We, in fact, between these parties ought to fear nothing
                                    as to the result, as after it we would have nothing to repent
                                    of.</p>
                                <p>Upon the questions of granting an audience, sending ministers to
                                    foreign courts and permitting the propagation of religion, I did
                                    not make any observations in the dispatch forwarded to

                                <p>I have humbly ascertained, however, that in the year 1676 <note

                                        Du Halde as having come to Pekin this year: that of Ysbrandt
                                        Ides was in 1689, but an envoy also came into Pekin the year
                                        before. Who is here referred to by <hi rend="italic"

                                    our canonized sovereign the Emperor Humane (Kanghi) admitted the
                                    Russian Nicholas and others to the presence, but the offerings
                                    given and ceremonies then practiced cannot now be fully
                                    ascertained. Though it is certain that the Russians were then
                                    discussing the frontier between our two countries, and the
                                    conditions of trade between us and them, they were still treated
                                    as an empire of equal position, and in a manner totally
                                    different from the usages practiced toward, the Coreans and
                                    other outside tribes. The same, treatment that Kanghi extended
                                    toward the Russians has since, during the reigns of Tau Kwang
                                    and Hien Fung, been shown towards the British, French, and
                                    Americans, <hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi>, regarding them all as
                                    equal nations. Our sacred dynasty, in its love of virtue and
                                    kindness to those from afar, has no desire to arrogate to itself
                                    the sway over the lands within the boundless oceans, or require
                                    that their ministers should render homage; and it will be
                                    suitable if, when your Majesty yourself takes the reins of
                                    government, they request an audience to grant it. Tide suitable
                                    presents and ceremonies can be settled at the time; for, as the
                                    envoys represent nations of equal rank, they need not be forced
                                    to do what is difficult. This course, on the whole, befits best
                                    the equality admitted, and exhibits our courtesy and dignity at
                                    the same time.</p>
                                <p>In regard to sending embassies abroad, the constant intercourse
                                    between ns and other countries with whom we have amicable
                                    relations will constantly cause questions to arise. The risk of
                                    our envoys disgracing those who sent them, and the fear of
                                    involving ourselves in vast expenses, are both subjects of
                                    anxiety. It may be found best for the high officers of both our
                                    own and foreign <note n="**" xml:id="d215fn2">This word is not

                                    condition of affairs, and when necessary recommend those whom
                                    they would send the ability of these men being ascertained, they

                                    If suitable men can be found, send them; but not, if none are
                                    ready, keeping the power of doing so always in our own hands;
                                    nor should other powers, if we are unwilling to send envoys,
                                    regard it as a cause for hostilities.</p>
                                <p>I have just received the dispatch from the foreign office
                                    respecting the appointment, by his Majesty’s order, of Chi Kang
                                    and Sun as our envoys to western countries. Henceforth there
                                    will be a perpetual interchange of civilities; the affairs of
                                    diplomacy will gradually increase; and though it may be found
                                    that one or two of our agents may prove unfit for their posts,
                                    who can tell whether such envoys as Su Wu, Pan Chau, Fu Peh, and
                                    Hung Hau <note n="*" xml:id="d215fn3">These are four
                                        distinguished envoys. Su Wu was sent, in the year B. C. 100,
                                        to a tribe of the Scythians; Pan Chau, in A. D. 87, attacked
                                        an army beyond the great wall, with whom he made a favorable
                                        peace; Fu Peh, in A. D. 1042, was sent to resist the Kitans,
                                        who had occupied districts south of the wall, and made them
                                        retire; and Hung Hau, in A. D. 1143, returned to Hangow from

                                <p>Seeing, therefore, that this point has for its objects the honor
                                    and prosperity of his Majesty, and the smoothing over
                                    difficulties, it seems best, on the whole, to accede to it.</p>
                                <p>In respect to affording facilities for the propagation of
                                    religion, I may be allowed to observe that the Roman Catholics
                                    began their work by tempting men to join them from mercenary
                                    motives; but latterly most foreign missionaries have been poor,
                                    and as they could not hold out so many advantages, their
                                    doctrines have not been believed. From the days of the Tsin and
                                    Han dynasties, the doctrines of Confucius and the sages have
                                    been rather obscured, so that Budhism has got gradually the
                                    ascendant; yet Budhism has been very greatly supplanted in
                                    India, its original country, by Mohammedanism. So, too,
                                    Romanism, which arose in the Roman empire, and obtained the
                                    supremacy; but subsequently Protestantism has vigorously opposed
                                    it. From these facts it is evidently plain that all these
                                    different religions fluctuate, having their rise and fall; while
                                    the doctrines of Duke Chau and of Confucius suffer no attrition
                                    during the lapse of ages, but still suffice to regulate the
                                    government of China, correct the manners of its people, and
                                    exalt the dignity and institutions of the land. If, therefore,
                                    the adherents of these other doctrines take every method to
                                    promulgate them, they will after all get but few supporters and
                                    converts. As there are many churches in the districts and
                                    prefectures in every province already erected, there can be no
                                    want for allowing them to erect any more. Should the foreigners,
                                    then, at the coming revision of the treaty, persistently press
                                    their demands on this head, it will be enough to promise them
                                    that, whenever occasion requires, protective orders will be
                                    issued in regard to this faith. It will not be necessary to add
                                    an additional article, and I think they will not ask further, or
                                    often urge it.</p>
                                <p>These latter points, whose results are not likely to be very
                                    disastrous, need not be debated so as to cause bitterness,
                                    though they ought not to be instantly granted when asked for.
                                    But the other demands for railroads, steamers going up the
                                    rivers, opening the salt trade, and building warehouses in the
                                    interior, are so disastrous to the occupations of our people
                                    that they ought to be strenously resisted. Bitter disputes need
                                    not arise about them, nor harsh language be used, but the points
                                    can be discussed good-humoredly, and fair, truthful arguments
                                    employed to convince them, at the same time, that we are decided
                                    not to grant them. Let them fully know that a regard for the
                                    welfare of the people as the means of preserving the state has
                                    been the constant principle of our ancient rulers through all
                                    ages, and also the law of all the sovereigns of our reigning
                                    family. Many affairs now demand our attention, while the
                                    foreigners are afraid of nothing; yet we cannot assent to
                                    everything they ask without any reference to its propriety, and
                                    disregard the necessities of our own people.</p>
                                <p>Should the day come when China gets the ascendant, and foreign
                                    nations decay and grow weak, we then should only seek to protect
                                    our own black-haired people, and have no wish to get military
                                    glory beyond the seas. Although they are crooked and deceitful,
                                    they yet know that reason and right cannot be gainsaid, and that
                                    the wrath of a people cannot be resisted. By employing a frank
                                    sincerity on our part we can no doubt move them to good ways,
                                    and then everything will be easily arranged to satisfaction.</p>
                                <p>These humble views are submitted, crude and immethodical as they
                                    are, for examination, that those which are deemed proper may be
                                    carefully considered.</p>
                                <p>A respectful memorial, drawn up in accordance with the decree
                                    concerning the revision of the treaty, and now sent by courier
                                    at the rate of 400 li (125 miles) a day, [to Pekin,] and upon
                                    which I humbly beg their Majesties the Empress Regents and the
                                    Emperor to bestow a sacred glance, and command their
                                    instructions on it.</p>

                                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> As arranged in our interview this
                                    afternoon, I have the honor to forward the Chinese text of the
                                    communication which I made verbally to your imperial highness
                                    and the ministers of the Yamên.</p>
                                <p>The object for which I sought a personal interview is so
                                    important, and the interest dependent on the decision that may
                                    ultimately be taken in reference to the measures proposed are of
                                    such magnitude, that I deem it essential the exact tenor of the
                                    observations and statements exchanged to-day on both sides
                                    should be on record. It will further serve to prevent any
                                    uncertainty or misapprehension by giving your imperial highness
                                    an opportunity of correcting any erroneous impressions I may
                                    have carried away from what passed in conversation.</p>
                                <p>Mr. Adkins, acting as interpreter, gave as closely as possible
                                    the purport of the inclosed memorandum, and various observations
                                    were made upon the several subjects referred to in the nineteen
                                    paragraphs, both during the interpretation and subsequently by
                                    your imperial highness and other members of the board.</p>
                                <p>As I understood these, the general purport was to the following
                                    effect: the Yamên expressed a desire for progress in so far as
                                    it might be in their opinion practicable and safe, keeping in
                                    view the present state of the country, but they claimed to be
                                    the sole judges both as to the measures to be adopted, the mode
                                    of execution, and the time for their introduction. It was
                                    contended that there were very serious difficulties to be
                                    encountered in the path of progress, and in any measures
                                    involving change from old established customs and principles,
                                    and nothing sudden could be ventured upon. China had national
                                    interests at stake which must be fully considered before any
                                    innovations could be made, and foreign powers must see the
                                    necessity of this, and consent to wait until the time should
                                    arrive when the way could be more clearly seen to a good end.
                                    The object of the Chinese mission was to represent these things
                                    to the treaty powers, and as for any articles of a treaty Mr.
                                    Burlingame may have signed they had not yet received the Chinese
                                    text, but as plenipotentiary he had no authority to bind the
                                    Chinese government by anything he might do without the
                                    ratification of the Emperor.</p>
                                <p>In answer to this, I observed such was the well-understood rule
                                    in all the relations of foreign powers. No minister could bind
                                    his government by any act not subsequently ratified by the
                                    government. But as to the necessity for waiting indefinitely
                                    until the Chinese government saw their way more clearly, I
                                    called attention to the tact that it was fast approaching ten
                                    years since the treaty of Tien-tsin was signed; that during the
                                    whole of this period there had been a manifest want of execution
                                    in many of the most important clauses, and her Majesty’s
                                    government thought the time had arrived for removing the causes
                                    of this all but total failure; and more especially the
                                    obstructions created by the provincial officials, and fatal to
                                    the development of commerce in the interior, for which object
                                    mainly the treaty was entered into by Great Britain. These
                                    obstructions could not be removed without greater facilities for
                                    inland navigation and residence than had heretofore been
                                    allowed, and the effective working of coal mines under foreign
                                    supervision, with all the arts and appliances of European
                                    science. Hence my insistence on these points. For if the Chinese
                                    government claimed the right to take their own way and choose
                                    their own time as to any correction of abuses, progress, or
                                    material improvements, foreign powers had a still more undoubted
                                    right to insist upon the faithful execution of treaties without
                                    any delay whatever, and that from the first day. And the time
                                    had now arrived in my opinion when no more delay ought to be
                                    suffered to take place.</p>
                                <p>Your imperial highness I think interposed to say it was not part
                                    of the obligations of treaties for the Chinese government to
                                    take any one of these steps I had urged, to which I replied that
                                    these particular measures were not specified in any of the
                                    treaties, but in all it was expressly stipulated that trade
                                    should be allowed in the interior, exempt from obstructions from
                                    the authorities, and illegal exactions. It was enough,
                                    therefore, to show by the experience of the last eight years
                                    that there had been a failure of execution in these particulars,
                                    and that nothing short of the measures indicated could lead to
                                    any better result to give a right to any foreign power,
                                    seriously damaged in its commercial interests, to insist upon
                                    their adoption, not because they were enumerated in the
                                    treaties, but as the essential condition of the more faithful
                                    observance of treaty rights and stipulations. The right to trade
                                    in the interior, like all other rights, carries with it whatever
                                    may be necessary to its fair and full enjoyment. I no first of
                                    these necessary conditions is ready access to the interior; the
                                    second, freedom from vexatious interference, and taxation
                                    contrary to treaty; and the third, such accommodation for
                                    persons and goods as may render trade in any large sense
                                    possible. To deny these is to nullify the treaty, and to defeat
                                    its most important object.</p>
                                <p>In improvement and progress, so far as those were in the interest
                                    of China alone, the Emperor might claim an exclusive voice, but
                                    in measures needful to the execution <pb n="312" xml:id="pg_312"
                                        facs="0346"/>of treaties, China no longer stood alone, and
                                    must of necessity adopt them, if disposed to act in good faith,
                                    and avert reclamation.</p>
                                <p>The American minister, having been present at this conference,
                                    took part also in the discussion, and no doubt will himself
                                    place on record the observations he offered for the
                                    consideration of the Yamên.</p>
                                <p>I will merely recall to your imperial highness’s memory one or
                                    two leading points as bearing more especially on the preceding.
                                    Having been appealed to on the subject of the Chinese mission
                                    and the declaration made by Mr. Burlingame, as the chief, when
                                    in the United States, he bore distinct testimony to the general
                                    accuracy of the statement contained in the fourteenth paragraph,
                                    and further added that great disappointment would be felt by the
                                    Government and people of the United States if nothing decidedly
                                    progressive were to result from the negotiations on the
                                    approaching revision of the British treaty. He reminded your
                                    imperial highness that some 60,000 Chinese subjects were
                                    residing in California, with full liberty to work and to trade
                                    wherever they pleased, whether in mines or towns, and that they
                                    had all the privileges the most-favored-nations clause could
                                    give, and equality of rights and treatment demanded reciprocity
                                    in China. Your imperial highness remarked in reply, that those
                                    Chinese were no doubt subject to given laws and jurisdiction,
                                    and if American citizens were equally subject in China to
                                    Chinese laws, they might have all the privileges of Chinese
                                    subjects also.</p>
                                <p>The American minister observed in answer that the difficulty here
                                    lay in the fact that there was no code of laws in China which
                                    could be accepted by western states, but as soon as a written
                                    code should be in existence, based on the same general
                                    principles as those constituting the law with minor
                                    modifications of the western world, the difficulty would cease.
                                    In the mean time the right to travel, to trade, and to reside as
                                    the consequence of the former, existed by treaties, though under
                                    different conditions in the two countries, and could not be
                                    refused.</p>
                                <p>Some further observations followed on my part, but as these were
                                    interrupted and left incomplete from the sudden indisposition of
                                    one of the ministers, I beg leave to state here in a more
                                    complete and connected form the remarks with which I intended to
                                    conclude.</p>
                                <p>Your imperial highness had remarked that careful consideration
                                    was needful; for, of many demands made, some were
                                    disadvantageous to Chinese interests, and could not on that
                                    account be accepted; others again would be a benefit to neither
                                    if acceded to, and for that reason ought not to be granted.</p>
                                <p>I wished, in answer to this general argument, to lay before your
                                    imperial highness strong reasons that existed for concluding
                                    that in matters of commerce the interests of China and foreign
                                    nations are identical, and what was really beneficial to the one
                                    could not be injurious to the other. Moreover, that Great
                                    Britain had not only preponderating interest in asking nothing
                                    which could inflict injury on China, but had, by deeds during
                                    the last eight years better than by words, shown unmistakably
                                    the earnest desire of her Majesty’s government to uphold the
                                    present rulers of China, and preserve the nation from falling
                                    into anarchy. Nearly all the treaty ports had, at some time or
                                    other, either been saved from falling into the hands of
                                    insurgents or recovered from them, chiefly by the aid of British
                                    forces. That, if it is said, in freely spending blood and
                                    treasure in the work, we were at the same time but protecting
                                    our own interests or the interests of trade in general, it may
                                    be quite true, but the argument only goes to prove the truth of
                                    my previous statement, that British and Chinese interests, where
                                    trade is concerned, are mutually dependent, and, to a great
                                    degree, identical. What permanently injures the one is a no less
                                    certain injury to the other. The British nation would,
                                    therefore, in their own interest, be the last to claim of the
                                    Chinese government concessions calculated to inflict an injury
                                    on the native population and trade, or even to weaken the power
                                    of the present government to maintain order and peace throughout
                                    the empire. It would be enough to show that either of these
                                    results must inevitably follow the measures now proposed to
                                    deter the British government from insisting upon their adoption.
                                    On the other hand, if this has not and cannot be shown, while it
                                    is easy to demonstrate that, without increased facilities of
                                    transport into the interior and for the storage of goods than
                                    has hitherto been conceded, no extension of foreign trade into
                                    the interior is practicable; and without effective measures for
                                    the removal of obstructions and exactions, persistently insisted
                                    upon by the provincial and local authorities, no free
                                    development of that trade is possible, as the experience of the
                                    last eight years has shown what can the refusal to adopt such
                                    measures be held to indicate but a determination to persevere in
                                    a course which amounts to a nullification of the treaty in its
                                    most important object, which, it cannot be too often repeated,
                                    was the protection and extension of trade throughout the empire.
                                    No foreign power, with large interests at stake, can be expected
                                    to submit patiently or indefinitely to so flagrant a wrong in
                                    violation of a treaty which was the last result of a costly war.
                                    If a nation incur all the expense in life and money of a great
                                    war 14,000 miles from their own coast to defend their interests
                                    and protect their commerce, it is impossible to suppose it will
                                    see that object entirely defeated by failure of execution in <pb

                                    stipulations, which were the price of peace. If, as your
                                    imperial highness would seem to contend, the treaty of Tien-tsin
                                    does not stipulate for such measures as these now proposed,
                                    seeing that no trade in the interior can prosper without them,
                                    all that can be said in reply is, that were this to he admitted
                                    by her Majesty’s government it would only afford an additional
                                    reason for claiming such revision as should supply the
                                    deficiency.</p>
                                <p>But I still hope your imperial highness and the ministers of the
                                    Yamên, collectively, will see that the time has arrived for
                                    removing all just cause of complaint and placing the trading
                                    relations of British subjects in the interior on the footing of
                                    security and immunity from illegal taxation and obstruction,
                                    without which the treaty itself becomes a dead letter.</p>
                                <p>This day eight years ago Lord Elgin and the army that accompanied
                                    him left the gates of Pekin after having secured the
                                    ratification of the treaty of Tien-tsin, and, in negotiation
                                    with your imperial highness, a further convention, that, in the
                                    terms of your proclamation then issued, “Hereafter the weapons
                                    of war may forever be laid aside, and all should join together
                                    in the work of promoting peace.” In that work of peace, and by
                                    peaceable means alone, we are now engaged in such revision as
                                    may tend to remove abuses and restrictions on trade clearly
                                    contrary to the spirit of the treaty then ratified and confirmed
                                    at Pekin, and I will not allow myself to think that there can be
                                    any ultimate failure, whatever difficulties may have been
                                    experienced hitherto in coming to a mutual understanding on the
                                    important subjects under discussion.</p>

                                <p>The British minister has asked for this interview to assure
                                    himself that the prince and ministers of the foreign board
                                    clearly comprehend the present position of affairs as regards
                                    the proposed measures for the better execution of the treaty and
                                    the approaching period for a revision.</p>
                                <p>1. All the measures hitherto proposed by the British minister
                                    have been measures essential to correct well ascertained abuses
                                    and insure the execution of existing treaties.</p>
                                <p>2. These measures, if not according to the letter, are entirely
                                    in the spirit of the treaties, and, if refused, it will impose
                                    upon her Majesty’s government the necessity of determining,
                                    without delay, what further steps may be fitting to arrest their
                                    indisputable right to a full and perfect execution of all the
                                    treaty stipulations. For ten years past there has been a total
                                    failure in respect to many essential articles. Whether singly or
                                    in concert with other treaty powers, all of which have the same
                                    grounds for action, the Yamên may rest assured action will be
                                    taken. Her Majesty’s government will not accept such a decision
                                    as a final solution of the questions now under discussion, or
                                    submit to a continuance of wrong from a persistent failure of
                                    execution of the treaty for so many years.</p>
                                <p>3. It was to avoid this necessity and to conciliate all interests
                                    that the British minister suggested a Chinese commission to
                                    investigate and discuss the proper steps to be taken. To give
                                    effect to these deliberations he has subsequently entered into
                                    direct negotiations with the Yamên, hoping to convince them that
                                    he had demanded nothing which could be rightly refused; nothing
                                    that was not both reasonable and practicable, as well as
                                    consistent with the best interests of China.</p>
                                <p>4. So far it appears he has but partially succeeded, and he has
                                    determined, therefore, on this last effort, face to face, to
                                    demonstrate the necessity as well as the advantage of
                                    concession, and the danger of breaking off all further
                                    negotiations with an unsatisfactory result.</p>
                                <p>5. On many questions, and some very important ones, they have
                                    happily come to an agreement. Measures have been devised to
                                    remedy the great abuses in the levy of transit and other dues
                                    upon foreign trade; and the Yamên have equally agreed to take
                                    steps for the formation of a code of written laws and fixed
                                    rules of procedure preparatory to the establishment of mixed
                                    courts for the trial of all cases between foreigners and
                                    natives.</p>
                                <p>6. These measures are calculated to effect two great objects: The
                                    removal of grievous injuries continually inflicted on foreign
                                    trade, and the subject of complaint and demands for redress
                                    which are a constant source of danger to the government that
                                    permits them; and justice to foreigners and Chinese alike when
                                    they are at variance, thus preparing a way for the modification
                                    of ex-territorial rights and free intercourse in the interior op
                                    equal terms.</p>
                                <p>7. But in order to give these measures full effect, and to carry
                                    them out in any completeness <pb n="314" xml:id="pg_314"
                                        facs="0348"/>and good faith, certain other conditions are
                                    essential. The foreign merchant must be able to follow his
                                    goods; carry them, if he will, in his own boats, and hire depots
                                    for their safe storage wherever great trading centers make it
                                    desirable. Hence the British minister proposed facilities for
                                    inland navigation, and the right of renting houses or godowns in
                                    the interior, under such rules and restrictions as might be
                                    found expedient.</p>
                                <p>8. The Yamên have so far admitted the necessity for these
                                    facilities that they consent to the merchants using their own
                                    boats, if propelled by oars or sails, and to their residing
                                    temporarily in the inns; but they refuse any right to rent
                                    houses or depots, and will not consent to a few steam-tugs
                                    navigating the Poyang Lake, exclusively to facilitate the
                                    foreign trade with the tea districts.</p>
                                <p>9. The British minister has now to state distinctly that, without
                                    both these points be conceded, nothing effective will have been
                                    done to carry out the treaty in its integrity or to obtain its
                                    principal object, which was to enable foreign merchants to carry
                                    their trade into the interior, free from illegal imposts or
                                    vexatious distinctions and delays. To relieve them of these and
                                    other impediments, due to the bad faith and corruption of the
                                    provincial officers at the various stations, is not possible if
                                    such facilities are refused.</p>
                                <p>10. The merchant must follow his goods to secure them from
                                    spoliation and his agents from the extremity of ill treatment,
                                    such as has quite recently occurred at Chen-chiang-pu, when the
                                    shroffs and others in the employment of British merchants have
                                    been beaten and tortured until they consented to a false
                                    declaration, to the prejudice of their employers.</p>
                                <p>11. Finally, the working of mines—those of coal more
                                    especially—by foreign engineering science and machinery has been
                                    waged as essential to facilitate the steamer traffic, both on
                                    the coast and on the Yangtse, but no less advantageous to the
                                    Chinese people and the government, which both employ or possess
                                    a large number of steamers. To this conditional assent has been
                                    given, but, as in the matter of inland residence and navigation,
                                    it has been so framed as to deprive it of all practical
                                    value.</p>
                                <p>12. These are vital points. On the favorable or adverse decision
                                    respecting them entirely depends the result of the present
                                    negotiations. If the Yamên persist in refusal, the British
                                    minister must repeat, as his final rejoinder, that effective
                                    remedy will have been provided for the abuses and violations of
                                    treaties, both in their letter and spirit, which have been too
                                    long permitted to harass the foreign merchant and prevent all
                                    free development of trade.</p>
                                <p>13. Before coming to this conclusion, the British minister trusts
                                    very earnestly that the Yamên will take the following certain
                                    results into consideration, in addition to all that has been
                                    already set forth:</p>
                                <p>14. The Chinese government has sent a mission to all the treaty
                                    powers. Their envoy has declared in the United States that this
                                    mission meant progress. It was on this understanding that the
                                    mission met with so cordial a reception in America, from both
                                    Government and people. It was on the faith of this promise of
                                    progress that the United States Government appears to have
                                    entered into an additional convention, declaring their desire to
                                    respect the independence and integrity of the Chinese empire,
                                    and to abstain from all undue pressure for sudden and great
                                    innovations. If there be any doubt in the minds of the ministers
                                    as to the correctness of these statements, let them ask the
                                    newly arrived representative of the United States, who was still
                                    in his own country when Mr. Burlingame arrived and the
                                    additional articles were signed.</p>
                                <p>15. No clearer evidence could be afforded to the Government and
                                    people of the United States that they have been misled and
                                    altogether deceived by the declaration that the mission meant
                                    progress, than the present action of the Yamên supplies. A
                                    refusal now on the part of the Yamên to grant these facilities,
                                    without which the treaties cannot be made effective, or carried
                                    into execution in their most important stipulations, cannot fail
                                    to bring the mission of the government into disrepute. Not
                                    progress, but a resolute denial of all that constitutes either
                                    progress or improvement, in furtherance of a stationary or
                                    retrograde policy, will be plainly seen to be the end
                                    contemplated.</p>
                                <p>16. That the Yamên considered what would be the natural and
                                    inevitable result of such a conviction once it is entertained by
                                    the cabinets of Europe. A refusal to listen to their envoy who
                                    attaches any faith to his representation will be the first of
                                    these. They will see that while he has been sent forth to talk
                                    in the name of the Emperor of <hi rend="italic">progress</hi> to
                                    the several treaty powers of the western world, the government
                                    here have determined to resist all efforts to vindicate them, to
                                    move even within the narrowest limits, or to advance a step, and
                                    declared, by acts more significant than words, their resolution
                                    to stand fast in the old way of passive resistance to every
                                    argument in favor of progress, whether rapid or slow,
                                    improvements however gradual. They will see that nothing more is
                                    to be hoped from negotiations dictated by a spirit of peace and
                                    good will toward China; and that if execution is to be obtained
                                    for existing treaties, it must be secured by other means and
                                    arguments than those hitherto resorted to by their
                                    representatives.</p>
                                <pb n="315" xml:id="pg_315" facs="0349"/>
                                <p>17. Finally it will remain for the British minister to show that,
                                    so far from any undue pressure having been resorted to, a whole
                                    year has been devoted to the patient consideration of the whole
                                    subject. So far from any demands for sudden and great changes
                                    before the government and country could be prepared having been
                                    made, many which might be desired have been altogether ignored,
                                    because they were of this character, such as railroads and
                                    telegraphs, although even in these a very gradual beginning
                                    might obviously be made, and as an experiment which could entail
                                    no serious prejudice to any national interests.</p>
                                <p>18. Even in matters of prescriptive right and undoubted
                                    expediency, such as the privileges and position of the
                                    diplomatic corps at Pekin and admission to the palace, among the
                                    principal of these, no word has been said by the British
                                    minister not because he did not deem them important, but because
                                    he knew these were subjects of discussion likely to create
                                    serious trouble and embarrassment to the Yamên at the present
                                    time, whereas a year or two hence, when the minority of the
                                    Emperor ceases, they must of necessity receive a satisfactory
                                    solution.</p>
                                <p>19. Thus, whatever was calculated to embarrass the progress of
                                    negotiations, and a satisfactory issue, if not essential to the
                                    attainment of the main object, has been carefully excluded with
                                    a thoughtful regard to the present state of affairs and the
                                    position of the ministers; and even some things in the highest
                                    degree desirable in the interests of foreign trade, such as the
                                    importation of foreign salt, have been kept out of sight, simply
                                    because they either necessarily did or might be supposed to
                                    involve more sudden and undesirable changes than would at the
                                    present moment be safely sanctioned. On the part of the British
                                    minister nothing has been left undone to secure a satisfactory
                                    solution of all difficulties. The final result of such effort
                                    now rests with the Yamên alone.</p>

                                        type="to">the British minister</persName>.</head>
                                <p>The Prince of Kung, &amp;c., &amp;c., makes a communication in
                                    reply:</p>
                                <p>The Prince has received and read with attention the dispatch of
                                    his excellency the British minister of the 14th of November,
                                    with its inclosure.</p>
                                <p>What passed at the recent conference having been carefully
                                    embodied in that dispatch, will be on record; there need be no
                                    further reference made to it.</p>
                                <p>What the Prince has said has already been spoken after careful
                                    consideration of the general situation.</p>
                                <p>China and foreign countries have national interests to care for
                                    alike. They cannot be coerced into similarity, for neither
                                    cannot wholly adopt the usages of the other. Is only one party
                                    to be consulted when dangerous and impracticable schemes are
                                    pressed for adoption? Foreign nations treat it as a crime on
                                    China’s part when she withholds her consent to them, though were
                                    China to moot such to foreign nations, (England,) Ms excellency
                                    the British minister would probably not agree to them. The same
                                    rule should hold good for both sides.</p>
                                <p>England and China alike wish to be benefited by the revision of
                                    the treaty, and to secure permanent advantages in the interests
                                    of true progress. Both sides should consider existing
                                    emergencies, be mutually conciliatory, and treat the matter
                                    exhaustively.</p>
                                <p>If the behests of the foreign merchants were absolutely
                                    fulfilled, without consideration for her difficulties, China,
                                    while seeking “progress” for the foreign merchant, would,
                                    contrary to all rights, be working her own retrogression. The
                                    Prince is very sensible of this, and on his part, therefore,
                                    though native merchants have interested his action on several
                                    points, he has declined to bring them before his excellency the
                                    British minister, fearing to cause difficulties with his
                                    excellency in dealing with <hi rend="italic">ex parte</hi>
                                    statements, (on the Chinese side.) Since the signing of the
                                    treaties, indeed, China has never prevented any of their
                                    provisions from taking effect. Breaches of regulations and
                                    mistakes have been once and again committed by the local
                                    authorities. These the Yamên have at once set right. The foreign
                                    merchants cannot all have suffered damage and losses, nor is
                                    there any actual decadence in trade.</p>
                                <p>Ten points have been conceded by the Prince, viz.: Reduction in
                                    duty on certain articles; free import of stores by dock
                                    companies; the trial of the bonded warehouse system; the
                                    substitution of a bond for each payment of the half duty
                                    deposit; payment of drawbacks in cash, when the goods are
                                    exported within three months; the adoption of one uniform touch
                                    for sycee at the various custom-houses; the selection of an
                                    additional port, either at Ta-tung, Au-ching, or Wu-hu; the
                                    substitution of Wenchow for the hitherto unopened port of
                                    Chiung-Chow, (Haiman.) A new set of rules has also been
                                    discussed, which will put the native trader on the same footing
                                    as the foreign merchant, when trading in foreign produce in the
                                    interior; while another set of rules places the foreign
                                    merchant, who buys native produce inland for reëxport or <pb
                                        n="316" xml:id="pg_316" facs="0350"/>ale at the next port,
                                    on the same footing as the native trader. Two proclamations have
                                    been framed. One, addressed to (the officials in charge of) the
                                    various customhouses, will put a stop to unauthorized levies,
                                    and will compel restitution when its provisions have been
                                    disobeyed. The other, which enjoins the people generally not to
                                    molest the foreign merchant who proceeds to the interior, will
                                    promote the extension of trade.</p>
                                <p>All the concessions made will enable the foreign merchant to
                                    obtain the advantages of inland commerce, secured to him by
                                    treaty, and will prevent him from suffering loss and injury. The
                                    reimport of native produce; its sale, when duties on it have
                                    been paid, at, the first port; the [establishment of] bonded
                                    warehouses, the arrangements for drawbacks, the opening of
                                    ports, (literally custom-houses,) are all new advantages,
                                    conceded extra treaty, and give proof of China’s “progress,”
                                    where treaties are concerned, while the tender care for foreign
                                    merchants evinced thereby cannot but be considered complete and
                                    satisfactory.</p>
                                <p>Every course of action should be anxiously considered in regard
                                    to its permanent result. Promises are readily made—their
                                    fulfillment is not so easy. It often happens that he who
                                    undertakes a matter finds it impracticable when called upon to
                                    put it in action, and. has to regret his want of caution in the
                                    first instance. Just so is it with the proposal of his
                                    excellency the British minister to admit steamers on the lakes
                                    and rivers, to establish hongs, and carry on mining operations
                                    in the interior. He, the British minister, desires to give the
                                    foreign merchants residing in the interior all the privileges of
                                    a native, without his being subject to any Chinese code. This
                                    would cripple the executive authority of China, and in practice
                                    be alike difficult and dangerous. Were the Prince constrained to
                                    concede these points, and they were found to be as prejudicial
                                    to the government and people of China as to be absolutely
                                    impracticable, it would be open to the British minister to
                                    upbraid China for her bad faith and incapacity. In declining to
                                    accede to them, therefore, the Prince has in view the
                                    preservation of harmony and good faith.</p>
                                <p>The expression of his excellency that the things proposed would
                                    be of benefit to China is evidence of friendly interest in her
                                    welfare. But it seems to the Prince that during his
                                    administration he has not failed to adopt any measure which was
                                    of advantage to China and which would leave her independent, and
                                    be without prejudice to her sovereign power; as, for instance,
                                    in the establishment everywhere of schools for languages, and
                                    arsenals, and the building of steamers, she has made use of
                                    foreign appliances to her own advantage, and that without any
                                    pressure from foreign ministers. But the above points differ
                                    from steam traffic on the lakes and rivers, the establishment of
                                    warehouses and mining, where the advantage to be gained is
                                    problematical, and injury to China’s sovereign power
                                    inevitable.</p>
                                <p>The physician who has to administer medicine to an invalid must,
                                    if his treatment is to be effective, first ascertain the
                                    constitutional conditions of his patient. These conditions vary,
                                    and it may be that the drug, which is a specific in one case,
                                    will be valueless or even hurtful in another. Thus it is that
                                    the Prince declares to be impracticable that which his
                                    excellency urges, to be beneficial, though still recognizing the
                                    good intentions of the British minister.</p>
                                <p>The Prince thinks that his excellency will fully appreciate these
                                    arguments. The treaties were concluded from a desire on the part
                                    of China to increase, her friendly relations with foreign
                                    powers, and the present revision is now being conducted by the
                                    Prince in a like spirit.</p>
                                <p>The inclosure, (in the dispatch under acknowledgment,) in
                                    nineteen paragraphs, is fairly identical in meaning with
                                    memoranda previously received, and a categorical answer is
                                    embodied in the accompanying memoranda, (No. 1.) The points in
                                    the other separate, memoranda (No. 2) will be for discussion by
                                    the Prince and his excellency the British minister. The Prince
                                    begs his excellency to consider it carefully, and. to favor him
                                    with a reply upon it, and upon the two memoranda sent in on the
                                    27th of June.</p>
                                <p>The Prince has received a dispatch from his excellency the
                                    American minister, to which he need not here allude, as he is
                                    about to reply to it.</p>
                                <p>A necessary communication, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

                                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: On Monday last, at the joint
                                    interview of the British minister and myself with your highness
                                    and members of the Tsung-li Yamên, I took occasion to submit a
                                    few considerations in connection with the growing intercourse
                                    between the citizens of the <pb n="317" xml:id="pg_317"
                                        facs="0351"/>United States and China, upon a clear
                                    understanding of which I think important results depend.</p>
                                <p>It was scarcely practicable in a desultory conversation, and with
                                    the difficulties of verbal interpretation, to make every point
                                    as intelligible as the gravity of the subject demands; and I
                                    now, agreeably to promise, submit my views in writing.</p>
                                <p>The present seems an opportune occasion for a candid interchange
                                    of opinion, since some of the changes proposed in the British
                                    treaty, now under consideration, cannot fail to affect the
                                    interests of the United States.</p>
                                <p>The policy of my Government is doubtless well understood by your
                                    highness. It is the policy of peace, based upon reason, justice,
                                    and humanity, seeking no advantage inconsistent with the general
                                    welfare, its cherished object is to promote fraternal
                                    intercourse between nations.</p>
                                <p>Influenced by a natural interest in the oldest of living nations,
                                    hitherto deemed the Most exclusive, it was with extreme
                                    gratification the Government and people of my country learned,
                                    near the close of the last year, that the government of China
                                    had determined upon sending am embassy to the western
                                    powers.</p>
                                <p>The reception of this embassy in the United States may be
                                    regarded as an epoch in the history of diplomatic intercourse.
                                    From the day of its arrival at San Francisco, to the day of its
                                    departure for Europe, demonstrations of respect and honor were
                                    lavished upon its members. Its approach was heralded by the
                                    press of the country as a great advance in the march of modern
                                    civilization; and its arrival was the signal for generous
                                    expressions of welcome from the statesmen and orators of our
                                    land.</p>
                                <p>The President of the United States received the embassy with
                                    marked cordiality, and expressed his appreciation of the
                                    sagacity with which the enlightened Chinese government had
                                    responded to the amicable policy adopted by Christian
                                    nations.</p>
                                <p>Both Houses of Congress gave your embassadors an enthusiastic
                                    official reception. The Speaker of the House of Representatives
                                    availed himself of the occasion to say that this embassy, which
                                    had attracted such universal attention, had been hailed
                                    throughout our land, not only as marking an onward step in the
                                    world’s history, but as being of peculiar interest to the
                                    republic.</p>
                                <p>These friendly sentiments, officially expressed, may be regarded
                                    as the unanimous voice of the nation.</p>
                                <p>Considering the growth of American commerce with China, the rapid
                                    extension of our Pacific steam navigation, the approaching
                                    completion of our great transcontinental railroad, and the
                                    enterprising character of our people, this gratifying movement
                                    on the part of a great nation with which we have such important
                                    relations could have but one interpretation. Everywhere and by
                                    all classes, with singular unanimity, it was understood to mean
                                    the abandonment by China of its former exclusive policy, and the
                                    substitution of one more in accordance with the progressive
                                    spirit of the age.</p>
                                <p>Reference is made to these facts to indicate some of the grounds
                                    upon which a liberal policy in the future may reasonably be
                                    anticipated.</p>
                                <p>Upon a perusal of the correspondence and minutes of proceedings
                                    in connection with the proposed revision of the British treaty,
                                    I find every point upon which differences of opinion exist fully
                                    considered.</p>
                                <p>It is extremely gratifying to observe the courtesy, intelligence,
                                    and ability with which the propositions of the British minister
                                    are discussed by the members of the Tsung-li Yamên. Before a
                                    final decision, however, is rendered upon the questions still at
                                    issue, it is earnestly to be hoped that the government of China
                                    will not permit so favorable an opportunity to pass without
                                    placing upon record a substantial guarantee of its disposition
                                    to make a forward movement. Future misunderstanding may be
                                    prevented by a distinct declaration of policy at this time.</p>
                                <p>So far, the few points conceded are of minor importance, and can
                                    scarcely result in any practical good, either to natives or
                                    foreigners, without those substantial concessions upon which the
                                    prosperity of commerce and all mutual advantages of intercourse
                                    depend.</p>
                                <p>The abolition of interior transit passes and institution of an
                                    increased import duty will not, I apprehend, prevent those
                                    abuses which now form so serious an impediment to trade. The
                                    course of proceeding necessary to secure indemnity for illegal
                                    taxation is liable to give rise to vexatious delays by opening
                                    new fields for litigation.</p>
                                <p>Undoubtedly, the true solution of this problem lies in the
                                    removal of unnecessary restrictions upon foreign merchants. If
                                    permitted to reside in the interior, rent or purchase
                                    warehouses, and carry on their business without unnecessary
                                    checks and hinderances, they would soon come to a good
                                    understanding with the mandarins and people; mutual prejudices
                                    would gradually be removed, and confidence established. If the
                                    trade continues, it must come to this sooner or later; and the
                                    question for the consideration of your highness is, whether it
                                    is well to prolong indefinitely existing causes of
                                    dissension.</p>
                                <p>There can be no equality among nations without mutual advantages
                                    of intercourse. At this time there are sixty thousand Chinese on
                                    the Pacific coast, who are engaged in almost every branch of
                                    industry open to our own citizens. They are permitted to <pb
                                        n="318" xml:id="pg_318" facs="0352"/>travel or trade, rent
                                    or purchase houses, wherever their inclination may lead them.
                                    Local prejudices, which, from want of knowledge of their true
                                    character, formerly existed against them, are rapidly
                                    disappearing; and they are now regarded by intelligent classes
                                    of the community as an orderly, industrious, and valuable part
                                    of our population. Might not similar good results attend the
                                    extension of increased facilities for intercourse to the few
                                    foreigners in this country? Those who seek to trade and
                                    purchase, or rent property in the interior, are generally men of
                                    responsible character, who have large pecuniary interest at
                                    stake. No better guarantee could be given against lawless and
                                    disorderly proceedings.</p>
                                <p>On this point it was understood to be remarked by several members
                                    of the Yamên at the interview of Monday, that the Chinese in the
                                    United States are under American law, and that if Americans
                                    would consent to subject themselves to China law in this
                                    country, they might reasonably expect equal privileges.</p>
                                <p>This question has been discussed for many years, and it is
                                    unnecessary now to repeat the argument advanced. When the
                                    government of China shall deem it expedient to establish a code
                                    of laws based upon principles of justice, recognized and
                                    accepted by the comity of western nations, and to which the
                                    Government of the United States can safely give its assent, then
                                    this cause of complaint will doubtless be removed.</p>
                                <p>An important question, upon which no agreement has yet been
                                    reached, is the proposed extension of steam navigation on the
                                    inland waters. All experience has demonstrated in Europe,
                                    America, and India, and to some extent in the waters of China,
                                    that without the use of vessels and machinery propelled by
                                    steam, no extensive systems of trade can now be carried on, in
                                    any country, with profit. In Mexico, Central and South. America,
                                    and other countries through which railroads have been
                                    constructed only to a limited extent, steam navigation on the
                                    coast and inland waters is now making considerable progress.
                                    These countries, however, are still very far behind the times,
                                    and the consequence is they are poor, and their trade is small
                                    compared with their capacity for production.</p>
                                <p>The use of small steamers, or even steam-tugs on the upper waters
                                    of the Yangtse-kiang, on the Poyang Lake, and on the Pei-ho
                                    River, from Tien-tsin to Tung-chow, would greatly facilitate the
                                    transportation of merchandise and domestic products, and would
                                    dispense with unnecessary and unprofitable labor, which could
                                    well be devoted to the opening of coal mines, building of roads
                                    and other works of internal improvement. This need not be done
                                    so rapidly as to produce distress among the laboring classes,
                                    who now earn a subsistence in the old way; but if any change is
                                    contemplated, what advantage is gained by indefinite
                                    postponement? Why should not a beginning be made now as well as
                                    a half a century hence? The people cannot adapt themselves to a
                                    new condition of things before anything new is attempted. If
                                    they were now undergoing a course of preparation, some definite
                                    results might be anticipated; but merely to hold back when all
                                    the rest of the world is advancing, is to invite that foreign
                                    interference which is so much deprecated.</p>
                                <p>If the employment of a large number of men, where a few only are
                                    necessary to do the work, could be regarded as advantageous,
                                    then there would be good reason why the freight boats, now
                                    hauled by hand up many of the rivers, might be dispensed with,
                                    and the cargoes carried by coolies. But such a course, although
                                    it would furnish employment to many who probably need it, would
                                    not increase the means of subsistence. It cannot be denied that
                                    freight boats have already dispensed with much unprofitable
                                    labor, and small steamers or steam-tugs would only be another
                                    step in the same direction.</p>
                                <p>A similar argument may be used in reference to railroads. Nearly
                                    all the land transportation is now carried on by means of
                                    coolies, camels, wheelbarrows, and small wagons. No system more
                                    difficult, tedious, and expensive could be devised. It is a
                                    draft upon labor without adequate result. Nevertheless, it could
                                    not be expected, much less desired, by a friendly power, that
                                    sudden and extraordinary changes should be made. An experiment
                                    on a small scheme, say from Taco, Tien-tsin, or even Tung-chow
                                    to Pekin would test the advantages of railroads, where the work
                                    could be directly Tinder control of the government. There are
                                    private capitalists who would be willing to take all the
                                    pecuniary risk, and receive their compensation upon any
                                    equitable basis that might be agreed upon as not injurious to
                                    the interests of China. Even a tramway from the coal mines in
                                    the vicinity of Pekin to the city walls, or to the river, would
                                    be a reasonable beginning. The supply of coal now depends upon
                                    the growth of grass, for in bad seasons the camels starve, and
                                    coal becomes scarce and dear. This is a very uncertain
                                    dependence for so indispensable an article.</p>
                                <p>It is earnestly to be hoped that this great empire, abounding in
                                    so many natural resources, and with a people so industrious, so
                                    skillful in mechanics, so peculiarly qualified in all respects
                                    to avail themselves of modern inventions, will not oppose all
                                    experiments in this direction. Already ample proof has been
                                    furnished that the laboring classes of China, constituting so
                                    large a proportion of the population, are not inimical to these
                                    new contrivances for saving time and making labor profitable.
                                    Ten thousand Chinese have aided in building the great central
                                    railroad across the continent of North <pb n="319"
                                        xml:id="pg_319" facs="0353"/>America; and there is not an
                                    instance in which they have refused to work for fair
                                    compensation, because of any prejudice or superstition. The
                                    arsenal at Shanghai, in which seven hundred native workmen are
                                    employed, presents conclusive evidence of their readiness and
                                    ability to perform any kind of mechanical labor, even to the
                                    manfacture of engines and building of steamers, which they have
                                    already done with complete success.</p>
                                <p>The commerce of the vast interior might be greatly increased by
                                    these new methods of communication. Agriculture has been carried
                                    to great perfection, and now yields very nearly its maximum. But
                                    so dense a population cannot derive a subsistence from this
                                    source after an enlarged foreign intercourse has once commenced.
                                    New demands are made, new wants are created; and a greater
                                    diversity of pursuits becomes necessary. Mining, manufactures,
                                    and various internal improvements furnish additional and
                                    profitable occupation; and nations become rich and prosperous as
                                    they adopt the use of steam and improved methods of labor, while
                                    all countries in which these have not been introduced, find it
                                    difficult to maintain an existence.</p>
                                <p>The question of opening the coal mines has been considered
                                    without any satisfactory result. No real concession has been
                                    made. There is a great demand for coal at the principal
                                    commercial marts on the coast. It is well known that coal seams
                                    of great extent and richness exist near the banks of the
                                    Yank-tze-kiang and in the province of Shantung, also in the
                                    vicinity of Pekin. Mr. Raphael Pumpelly has fully demonstrated
                                    this in his report recently published. By the use of proper
                                    machinery for working the mines, and suitable improvements for
                                    transportation, there can be no doubt this indispensable
                                    article, could be delivered at the ports for less than half its
                                    present cost. This would be a source of large revenue to the
                                    Chinese government, and a great advantage to commerce; yet
                                    objections are made to the only means by which either natives or
                                    foreigners can avail themselves of this natural resource. A
                                    willingness is expressed to try the experiment of working
                                    certain mines by means of foreign machinery, under official
                                    direction and on government account. It will be of very little
                                    avail to get the coal out of the mines unless some cheaper
                                    methods of transportation are adopted. The cost of carrying it
                                    to the place of consumption is now the principal item of
                                    expense. Besides, no mining enterprise has ever been known to
                                    succeed in this way; and failure now would be very discouraging
                                    to all parties. Governments cannot, from the precarious nature
                                    of the pursuit, work mines successfully. It is for individual
                                    enterprise to make them profitable. In all countries where
                                    mining of any kind is carried on extensively it has been found
                                    expedient to allow the mines to be worked by private companies
                                    or individuals, who either purchase them in fee simple, as in
                                    the United States, or pay a share of the proceeds to the
                                    government. This has been done to promote individual effort
                                    without subjecting the public revenue» to unnecessary risks; and
                                    it has always been found most conducive to the development of
                                    the natural resources of the country.</p>
                                <p>To lease the coal mines, or a few of them, by way of experiment
                                    to whomsoever may offer the best terms for the privilege of
                                    working them, would seem to be a very reasonable way of making a
                                    beginning, and avoiding all risk by leaving the matter of
                                    success or failure to those individually concerned. It would not
                                    throw any of the laboring classes out of employment, or
                                    introduce a large foreign population. The work would be done by
                                    Chinese under proper direction; and thus a new field for native
                                    industry would be opened, while commerce would be greatly
                                    benefited.</p>
                                <p>At the interview of Monday, it was understood to be argued in
                                    response to some of these suggestions, that the government of
                                    China sees quite clearly the advantages to be derived from the
                                    introduction of foreign improvements, but that the country is
                                    not yet prepared for such changes as those recommended; that
                                    different interpretations may be given to the word “progress
                                    what is thought “progress” in our country, might be something
                                    very different in another; that here there are great
                                    difficulties in the way of changes; they must be gradual and
                                    based upon a sure foundation; that all progress which is not
                                    voluntary, or which comes from others, is spurious and must fail
                                    to be beneficial. In short, it was contended that China is
                                    willing to advance, but must do so in her own way, and at her
                                    own discretion.</p>
                                <p>Nothing can be more reasonable than this, as a fundamental
                                    principle. No friendly power can desire to impair the
                                    self-respect or detract from the independence of another. The
                                    government of the United States simply adheres to its
                                    established policy, in disclaiming any right or intention to
                                    interfere in the administration of the domestic affairs of
                                    China. The best possible proof of the soundness of that policy,
                                    and of its thorough appreciation by the Chinese government, can
                                    now be given to the world. In entering into the family of
                                    nations, it is impossible that China can postpone, indefinitely,
                                    all responsive movements upon which equality and friendly
                                    intercourse depend, without disregarding an essential element in
                                    the compact. Modem enterprise has penetrated the exclusiveness
                                    of this ancient empire, and it now becomes a question for the
                                    consideration of your highness, whether progress, as understood
                                    by western nations, can be arrested by arguments, however
                                    specious, or by governments, however pacific in their
                                    intentions.</p>

                                <p>There can be no question as to the object of the commercial
                                    world. It desires an extension of trade; but no trade with any
                                    nation can be profitable or enduring which is not of mutual
                                    advantage. It is a fallacy, therefore, to suppose that because
                                    foreigners may be governed by motives of self-interest, all the
                                    facilities and concessions they ask must be injurious to
                                    China.</p>
                                <p>I have thus frankly and in a spirit of true friendship stated my
                                    views. Results of inestimable magnitude and of profound interest
                                    to the welfare of this empire depend upon the action taken at
                                    this time. It is manifest to my mind that steam on the navigable
                                    waters, the proper working of coal mines, residence and all the
                                    rights of trade in the interior, and the gradual establishment
                                    of telegraphs and railroad systems, are essential measures of
                                    modern intercourse, and that some earnest of beginning, without
                                    unnecessary delay, would avert much future misunderstanding. An
                                    irresistible spirit of progression is effecting great
                                    changes-everywhere. Modern nations under the general impulse
                                    move rapidly, and will not be likely to leave the work of the
                                    present generation to posterity.</p>
                                <p>I have the honor to be, sir, with consideration and respect, your
                                    imperial highness’s obedient servant,</p>

                                <p>I. In respect to tariff and trade, or customs regulations:</p>
                                <p>1. To adopt a system of transit for articles entering into the
                                    export and import trade, which shall exempt them from all
                                    charges under whatever denomination of taxes, and whether in
                                    foreign or Chinese hands, the payment of a transit due of 2½ per
                                    cent, on all imports being secured at the port of entry by
                                    payment to the maritime customs, and by this means relieving
                                    them of all liability to the payment of Peking taxes, either at
                                    the ports or elsewhere, and to make the same known by imperial
                                    edict or proclamation.</p>
                                <p>2. To free all ship and dock stores, and any others for personal
                                    use, or exclusively foreign consumption, under certain rules
                                    calculated to attain the end.</p>
                                <p>3. To repay drawbacks in money during any current quarter.</p>
                                <p>4. To establish bonded warehouses at the ports where desired.</p>
                                <p>5. To reduce the tariff on same twelve articles enumerated in the
                                    memorial.</p>
                                <p>I. To this the Yamên are still anxious to attach a condition of
                                    general revision, so as to equalize all duties to an average of
                                    5 per cent., if her Majesty’s government declines to consent to
                                    the duties being doubled on tea, silk, and opium.</p>
                                <p>6. To abolish coast trade tea-bonds at the revenue ports.</p>
                                <p>7. To facilitate and equalize the payment of duties by fixing, as
                                    far as practicable, the touch of sycee at each port, as
                                    suggested in some of the memorials.</p>
                                <p>II. In greater facilities for trading operation and transport of
                                    goods in the interior:</p>
                                <p>8. To erect landing stages at certain points, to be determined
                                    upon on the Tangtsze.</p>
                                <p>9. To open one or more new ports on the coast, as may be
                                    hereafter determined.</p>
                                <p>10. To work in the vicinity of one or more of the treaty ports
                                    coal mines, with the aid of foreign skill and machinery, and all
                                    the necessary facilities for cheap transport to the points of
                                    shipment.</p>
                                <p>11. To give the right of navigation on the inland waters to
                                    foreign vessels and boats not propelled by steam, the
                                    restriction to hold only so long as the Chinese merchants
                                    themselves do not employ steamers on the same.</p>
                                <p>12. To place a steamer tug on the Poyang Lake, to aid the rapid
                                    transport of foreign-owned goods or produce.</p>
                                <p>13. To adopt a written code of commercial law, and fixed rules of
                                    procedure and practice, and a better constitution of mixed
                                    courts for its administration in all mixed cases of civil suit
                                    between foreigners and natives.</p>
                                <p>14. To issue a proclamation recognizing the right of foreigners
                                    to travel freely in the interior for purposes of trade, and to

                                <p>Prince Kung, chief secretary of state for foreign affairs,
                                    herewith makes a reply:</p>
                                <p>I have had the honor to receive your excellency’s dispatch of the
                                    27th ultimo, in which you inform me that when the three high
                                    ministers sent from this government as envoys to the treaty
                                    powers reached the United States, they were received by the
                                    President with great consideration and gratification, and that
                                    both Houses of Congress greeted them with marks of respect, that
                                    had not before been accorded to other ministers, while the
                                    people at large likewise showed them the utmost cordiality and
                                    regard.</p>
                                <p>From all this it is evident that the officers and people of the
                                    United States, without regard to rank or station, alike cherish
                                    a sincere friendliness toward the middle kingdom, and this
                                    assurance gives me, on learning what you have now informed me,
                                    the most gratifying pleasure, for which I now desire to express
                                    my thanks.</p>
                                <p>The various points which you have, in the dispatch under reply,
                                    urged this government to consider, in connection with the
                                    revision of the British treaty, likewise prove the earnest
                                    wishes which animate your excellency in aiding those
                                    consultations, and your suggestions and reasonings are every way
                                    good and reasonable. But in the conduct of its affairs it
                                    behooves every kingdom carefully to watch the times and their
                                    tendencies, in order that its own power suffer no detriment,
                                    neither in the prerogatives of the throne, nor in the power
                                    exerted over the people; but if these conditions be maintained,
                                    improvements (or new things) can be adopted. This principle is
                                    no more applicable to China than to every other country.</p>
                                <p>The advantages which your dispatch sets forth as certain to
                                    attend the adoption of those improvements, have constantly been
                                    brought forward by the foreign ministers who have lived in
                                    Pekin, in their frequent interviews. Some of their suggestions
                                    were such that we saw no insuperable difficulty in adopting
                                    them; but there were others which could not be adopted, and some
                                    which could not yet be accepted. We must carefully watch the
                                    times, and see whether to accept or refuse to do a thing now, or
                                    defer it to a subsequent day.</p>
                                <p>The former British minister, Sir Frederick Bruce, and indeed all
                                    the resident ministers in Pekin, were and have been well aware
                                    of these principles of action; but among them all no one better
                                    appreciated their force than the former minister from the United
                                    States, whom his Majesty has now sent as his envoy extraordinary
                                    to the treaty powers. Nor have I the least doubt but that, in
                                    succeeding to the post formerly held by Mr. Burlingame, your
                                    friendly feelings and clear comprehension of the situation are
                                    similar, for both are shown in the present dispatch in all the
                                    matured plans and excellent suggestions with which you have
                                    favored this government. I beg to thank you for the interest you
                                    have thus shown in whatever will benefit us.</p>
                                <p>I suppose that you are already aware of the present position of
                                    the negotiations with the British minister, and know all the
                                    arguments which have been used in discussing the various points;
                                    and I therefore deem it unnecessary to repeat them here, but
                                    content myself with these general remarks upon the whole
                                    question, and this expression of my sincerest thanks for the
                                    trouble you have taken.</p>

                                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Sir</hi>: I have received, through
                                    the hands of Mr. Vlangaly, the Russian minister, your letter of
                                    the 7th instant, transmitted to him for communication to myself
                                    and colleagues, containing the basis of a revision of the treaty
                                    between Great Britain and China.</p>
                                <p>Allow me to congratulate you upon the prospect of an early
                                    termination of your labors. You have had an exceedingly arduous
                                    duty to perform. The diversity of interests iuvolved on the one
                                    hand, and the prejudices to be overcome on the other, must
                                    render negotiations of this kind more difficult in China than in
                                    any other country. As one of the foreign representatives, I beg
                                    to tender you my thanks for the frankness and courtesy with
                                    which, so far as the common interests are concerned, you have
                                    conducted these negotiations.</p>
                                <p>While I cannot see in the result any positive evidence of a
                                    disposition on the part of the Chinese government to recede from
                                    its policy of exclusiveness, I nevertheless believe <pb n="322"
                                        xml:id="pg_322" facs="0356"/>that great good must grow out
                                    of your labors, more, in fact, than appears from the few and
                                    comparatively unimportant concessions made.</p>
                                <p>Since these negotiations commenced the ruling authorities of
                                    China have been placed in possession of a large amount of
                                    practical information respecting the necessities of the
                                    commercial world and the objects of the treaty powers. At no
                                    period since the beginning of foreign intercourse has there been
                                    so thorough an investigation of all subjects upon which
                                    differences exist, or such an amicable interchange of opinion.
                                    Questions of mutual interest have been considered in a candid
                                    and equitable spirit, and although the arguments advanced by you
                                    and your colleagues have failed to carry conviction to the
                                    Chinese mind, yet such is the power of truth that it must
                                    eventually penetrate the understanding of this peculiar people,
                                    and achieve its own triumphs over their prejudices.</p>
                                <p>I think there is more reason to hope for a change when they find
                                    it unavoidable, than to look for it in any voluntary movement.
                                    If the Chinese government can be brought to the conviction that
                                    there is no alternative but to advance; that procrastination
                                    will not avail to ward off threatened evils; that the time for
                                    mere argument is passing away; I have no doubt the means of
                                    progress indicated during your protracted discussions will be
                                    found entirely feasible. At all events, the more consideration
                                    given to them, the less formidable they will appear.</p>
                                <p>It seems to me that the dangers of any direct and positive
                                    movement, or radical change, are greatly overrated, not only by
                                    Chinese statesmen, but by many foreigners long resident in the
                                    country.</p>
                                <p>No such evils as those anticipated have ever resulted from the
                                    introduction of steam and improved systems of labor in other
                                    parts of the world; and the reasons given to show that the
                                    experience of mankind elsewhere is inapplicable here, strike me
                                    as utterly unfounded. If such a line of argument as this were to
                                    prevail, it would forever exclude any advance. Urged in the
                                    apparent interest of the Chinese, it really sustains their
                                    prejudices and strengthens them in a course of resistance to
                                    innovation, which, if continued, must inevitably result in their
                                    ruin. Besides, it conveys a reflection upon their common sense,
                                    mechanical ingenuity and capacity for improvement not warranted
                                    by facts. It is a timid policy which hazards all in attempting
                                    to hazard nothing. That you do not share in these opinions is
                                    sufficiently manifested in your earnest and persistent appeals
                                    to the Yamên to make a practical beginning in the introduction
                                    of steam and other foreign improvements throughout the interior.
                                    I am, therefore, free to say that I consider all arguments
                                    having such a tendency as unworthy the age in which we live. For
                                    my part, I see more danger in protracted delay than even in the
                                    most sudden and radical of innovations. An acquiescence in the
                                    Chinese view would lead to retrogression; and in that there are
                                    elements of far greater disaster to China than any contained in
                                    the proposed changes. In concentrating the attention upon the
                                    difficulties of an advance movement, the accumulating dangers of
                                    delay are too apt to be forgotten.</p>
                                <p>Having already, in my letter to his imperial highness Prince
                                    Kung, dated November 23, (of which you have a copy,) expressed
                                    my views on most of the points referred to in your summary of
                                    results, it is unnecessary now to recapitulate them. I shall
                                    therefore confine my remarks, in this connection, to a few
                                    important considerations suggested by your communication.</p>
                                <p>1. As to right of residence, with the privilege of renting or
                                    purchasing warehouses in the interior.</p>
                                <p>This, I think, is absolutely an essential step toward any
                                    thorough or practical reform. Without it we remain on the outer
                                    edge, and never touch the reason or intelligence of the great
                                    mass of the people. What is done at the ports comes to them
                                    diluted or perverted through hostile channels.</p>
                                <p>It is quite hopeless to expect, in the absence of a newspaper
                                    press, that they will ever get at the truth or form a correct
                                    estimate of foreign character without direct personal
                                    intercourse with foreigners; nor is it easy to conceive how the
                                    greatest of all impediments to free intercourse, ignorance of a
                                    common language for intercommunication, can be diminished by
                                    restricting foreign merchants in their right of residence to the
                                    ports. Few of them thus restricted ever learn to speak Chinese,
                                    and their servants and coolies, who acquire a smattering of
                                    foreign languages, form a distinctive class who rarely
                                    intermingle with the natives of the interior.</p>
                                <p>The main objection urged by the Chinese government against
                                    foreign residence in the interior is, that the treaty powers are
                                    not willing to relinquish exterritorial privileges. The
                                    humiliating spectacle, they contend, would, if this were
                                    permitted, be presented to their own people of a foreign
                                    population, in the heart of their own country, exempt from the
                                    operation of its laws. Such a state of things, they conceive,
                                    would bring their authority into contempt, and sooner or later
                                    subvert their sovereign power, and result in their
                                    denationalization. This argument is natural enough from the
                                    Chinese standpoint, but if we accept it as conclusive, why make
                                    any further effort to force our civilization upon them? It all
                                    has the same tendency unless they rise to our standard. The
                                    exact line of distinction between the amount of injury already
                                    inflicted <pb n="323" xml:id="pg_323" facs="0357"/>upon their
                                        <hi rend="italic">amore propre</hi> and that which may be
                                    necessary in order to advance them to a higher civilization, and
                                    a more enlightened estimate of the destiny within their reach,
                                    is doubtless very difficult to define, but surely the necessity
                                    for exterritoriality will not be lessened by limiting foreign
                                    intercourse to the ports. There must be a fixed code of laws and
                                    a radical change in the system of administering justice in this
                                    country before exterritorial protection can find a substitute in
                                    native courts, and the only way to bring that about is by
                                    increased intercourse. Hence, to expect a change for the better,
                                    where the means are rejected, is to look for an effect without a
                                    cause.</p>
                                <p>The establishment of a mixed court at Shanghai for the trial of
                                    petty offenses is a movement in the right direction, but even in
                                    that there is a manifest determination to adhere to Chinese
                                    usages. Instruments of torture are insisted upon as essential to
                                    the administration of justice. It is a beginning to be sure, but
                                    not at a point likely to effect marked or beneficial changes in
                                    the interior. A partial concession may, by diverting attention
                                    from material measures of progress, tend rather to retard than
                                    advance those substantial and comprehensive reforms so earnestly
                                    pressed upon this government. Nevertheless I sincerely entertain
                                    the hope that the mixed court may lead to something better.</p>
                                <p>2. The opening of coal mines, by leasing them to foreigners, or
                                    allowing them to be worked in accordance with the general mining
                                    laws of other countries.</p>
                                <p>This is rejected, and it is agreed that some mines shall be
                                    worked by foreign machinery under official direction. However
                                    much the government may desire the experiment to succeed, I fear
                                    this principle of working mines can never prove successful. It
                                    has not succeeded in other countries where surrounding
                                    circumstances were much more favorable. Something, however, will
                                    be gained by such an experiment. If unsuccessful, the means of
                                    success will be practically demonstrated. If successful, the
                                    government Will have proved beyond controversy the beneficial
                                    effects of innovations which it now so strenuously
                                    deprecates.</p>
                                <p>3. Navigation of the interior waters by foreign steamers beyond
                                    the points now permitted.</p>
                                <p>On this subject it is useless to multiply arguments. All has been
                                    said that could have been expected to remove existing
                                    prejudices, without any effect so far, except the promise to
                                    place a steam-tug on the Po-yang Lake. An enterprise of this
                                    kind, conducted by native authorities, hostile to the objects
                                    contemplated and ignorant of the means by which it may be
                                    profitably conducted, must after all depend for its success upon
                                    foreign skill and energy. How far existing scruples on that
                                    point may be overcome remains of course to be seen. The good
                                    that may be expected from this concession, limited as it is,
                                    lies chiefly in the fact that such a beginning, however it may
                                    be designed to operate, has in it a forward tendency. As
                                    remarked in reference to coal mines, even its failure under
                                    Chinese auspices will bring into consideration the causes and
                                    the means of success. It will at least accustom the people to
                                    the appearance of a steamer in an unfrequented locality.</p>
                                <p>On these three points I have thus frankly given you my views.
                                    With respect to the minor concessions made, I am unable to form
                                    a very accurate estimate of their value. Much will depend on the
                                    good faith in which they are carried into effect, and something
                                    upon inherent difficulties arising from what has been
                                    rejected.</p>
                                <p>I am clearly of opinion, however, that you have accomplished all
                                    that can possibly be achieved at present by diplomatic means.
                                    While I cannot but regret that the government of China adheres
                                    so persistently to its policy of exclusion, I have great
                                    confidence in the results that must accrue from your labors, and
                                    feel assured that there is promise in the future.</p>

                                <p>In reply to your letter of the 4th March, I am directed by the
                                    Lords of the Committee of Privy Council for Trade to request
                                    that you will inform the Earl of Clarendon that they have
                                    carefully considered the various questions raised in the
                                    correspondence transmitted to them by his lordship on the
                                    subject of the commercial relations between this country and
                                    China, more especially in connection with the proposed revision
                                    of the treaty of Tien-tsin.</p>
                                <p>Two distinct and conflicting lines of policy are presented for
                                    the consideration of <pb n="324" xml:id="pg_324" facs="0358"
                                    />her Majesty’s government on the occasion of a revision of our
                                    treaty relations with China:</p>
                                <p>1. To insist not only upon the effectual execution of existing
                                    engagements, but also upon new and important concessions with a
                                    view to what is called “opening up” China to foreign trade, and
                                    introducing western civilization into the empire.</p>
                                <p>2. To confine the present negotiations to the assertion of
                                    admitted treaty rights essential to the gradual progress of
                                    foreign trade, to the removal of such defects in the Chinese
                                    administration affecting foreign trade as the Chinese government
                                    is willing and able to undertake to remedy, and to the
                                    acceptance of some spontaneous concessions.</p>
                                <p>It appears to my lords, after reading this correspondence, that
                                    if any doubt at any time existed as to the impossibility of
                                    obtaining at the present time, except by force, the larger
                                    concessions which are called for by the mercantile body in
                                    China, such as the right of residence in the interior and of
                                    working mines, the introduction of railroads and telegraphs and
                                    inland steam navigation, such doubts can no longer be
                                    entertained.</p>
                                <p>Sir R. Alcock, who at some stages of the transactions under
                                    review, especially at the date of his dispatch No. 70, of 10th
                                    November, 1868, seems to have been to a certain extent under the
                                    influence of his more sanguine and less responsible diplomatic
                                    colleagues, and of the order of ideas inspired by the display of
                                    force at Yang-tchoo, arrives, at the close of the
                                    correspondence, at the conclusion that the results of the labors
                                    of the mixed commission, reported in his dispatch No. 72, of 6th
                                    December, 1868, are all that can be obtained by negotiation at
                                    the present time; and that unless her Majesty’s government is
                                    prepared to resort to other means than those which he has felt
                                    authorized to employ, and with a clear contingency of war for
                                    the attainment of the main points insisted on by the merchants
                                    and by his colleagues generally, as alone important and
                                    essential to all effective progress, they must be content with
                                    much less, and with the somewhat vague hope of gradual
                                    progress.</p>
                                <p>This view is expressed even more emphatically by Mr. Hart in his
                                    very able letter to Sir R. Alcock of December 4, 1868: “Of
                                    course, force will wrest anything from China; but wherever there
                                    is action there is reaction; and as sure as natural laws
                                    continue to act, so sure it is that appeals to force in one age
                                    will give to the men of a later day a heritage of vengeance—the
                                    Europeans of some future day may wish that their forefathers had
                                    not sown the seeds of hatred in the bayonet-ploughed soil of
                                    Cathay.”</p>
                                <p>My lords believe that this view is moreover shared by Sir. Wade,
                                    with whom, in accordance with Lord Clarendon’s suggestion, they
                                    have conferred upon this subject, and by many other persons
                                    whose opinion is deserving of great consideration.</p>
                                <p>It is true that the memorials which have been addressed to her
                                    Majesty’s government and to Sir R. Alcock by the British
                                    mercantile body in China are generally in favor of what is
                                    termed a more vigorous policy, and that the language of the
                                    foreign representatives at the court of Pekin, and especially
                                    that of the United States minister, Mr. Ross Browne, (although
                                    even that gentleman himself admits in his letter to Sir R.
                                    Alcock of 17th December, 1868, that “all has been accomplished
                                    which can at present be achieved by diplomatic means,”) lead to
                                    the inference that they incline to the same view.</p>
                                <p>It is unnecessary for my lords to observe that they have every
                                    disposition to give due weight to the representations of those
                                    who are more directly interested than any other class of her
                                    Majesty’s subjects in the question under discussion, but they
                                    cannot forget (as is stated in Sir R. Alcock’s dispatch No. 76,
                                    of 23d December last) that “our position in China has been
                                    created by force—naked physical force; that any intelligent
                                    attempt to improve or maintain that position must still look to
                                    force in some form, latent or expressed, for the results;” and
                                    the responsibilities and sacrifices involved in the exercise of
                                    force must fall upon the British nation, and not upon that
                                    section of its people which is engaged in the trade with
                                    China.</p>
                                <p>The same remark applies with scarcely less weight to the case of
                                    the representatives of other countries at Pekin. Any policy
                                    which led to the interruption of peaceful relations with China
                                    would be attended with far greater danger to British interests
                                    than to those of other nations, and in advocating a course
                                    liable to such contingencies both merchants and ministers are
                                    urging on a policy in the fruits of which, if successful, they
                                    would largely share, and in which the consequences of failure
                                    would fall chiefly upon other interests than those which they
                                    represent.</p>
                                <p>The course, therefore, which my lords would recommend for the
                                    consideration of her Majesty’s government under existing
                                    circumstances is as follows:</p>
                                <p>1. To endeavor to arrive at an understanding with the government
                                    of China by which the formal revision of the treaty of Tien-tsin
                                    may be deferred until the majority of the Emperor, which Sir R.
                                    Alcock states will take place in 1872 or 1873. Such a
                                    postponement of the revision is, in my lords’ opinion, desirable
                                    for three reasons:</p>
                                <p>(<hi rend="italic">a.</hi>) There will then be a “personal and
                                    tangible” power with whom to deal.</p>
                                <p>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>.) It may be hoped that hi five years
                                    there may exist a greater disposition to extend oreign trade and
                                    relations than at present.</p>
                                <p>(<hi rend="italic">c</hi>.) The claim for revision will then
                                    coincide in point of time with that of the last <pb n="325"
                                        xml:id="pg_325" facs="0359"/>reaty power entitled to prefer
                                    it, and it may be hoped that the simultaneous action and
                                    coöperation of all those powers may then be secured.</p>
                                <p>2. That in the mean time, and pending such general revision, Sir
                                    R. Aleock should be instructed to obtain, if possible, the
                                    consent of the Chinese government to such arrangements as they
                                    have already expressed their readiness to adopt in view of an
                                    immediate revision, such arrangements to be effected either by a
                                    short convention, if this be necessary, or by independent
                                    action.</p>
                                <p>These arrangements are stated at page 172 of the printed
                                    correspondence in Sir R. Alcock’s dispatch No. 72, of the 6th
                                    December, and are the result of the negotiations conducted by
                                    the mixed commission which was appointed at his request to
                                    arrive at a preliminary understanding as to the bases of
                                    revision.</p>
                                <p>My lords will enumerate them in order, and whenever necessary
                                    make such remarks upon them as occur to them in connection with
                                    the questions to which they respectively refer:</p>
                                <p rend="center">1. <hi rend="smallcaps">Transit dues.</hi></p>
                                <p>This proposal is nothing more than the literal fulfillment of
                                    existing stipulations in the treaty of Tien-tsin, and involves
                                    no new concessions whatever.</p>
                                <p>The question of transit dues is stated by all the authorities on
                                    this subject to be the next important point in connection with
                                    the present negotiations. A considerable difference of opinion
                                    exists in different quarters as to the precise nature of the
                                    claims which, in virtue of the seventh supplementary treaty
                                    rule, in execution of Article XXVIII of the treaty of Tien-tsin,
                                    her Majesty’s government is equitably entitled to assert.</p>
                                <p>My lords entertain no doubt that the view expressed in some of
                                    the memorials, and even at one time by Sir R. Alcock himself in
                                    his correspondence with Mr. Hart, viz.: that the payment of the
                                    transit dues ought to be held to exempt the goods upon which it
                                    has been paid from all subsequent internal taxation, and to
                                    insure the sale of the goods to their ultimate consumer with no
                                    enhancement of cost derived from taxation, save that represented
                                    by the import and transit duties, is a view which cannot be
                                    entertained by her Majesty’s government. There is nothing in the
                                    terms of the treaty which appears to my lords to justify such a
                                    sweeping demand, and in view of the internal taxation to which
                                    native goods are subject in China, it would be in their opinion
                                    both unjust and inexpedient to enforce such a demand, even if it
                                    were warranted by the terms of treaty stipulations.</p>
                                <p>All that her Majesty’s government can claim in this respect
                                    appears to my lords to be that in the treaty ports the importer
                                    shall have the right to sell his goods in the market, after
                                    payment of the customs duties stipulated, and that he shall have
                                    the right to send goods to any internal market which he may
                                    select, free from any other charge than the customs duty on
                                    importation, and the stipulated transit duty; but that, both at
                                    the port and at the internal market, when once the goods have
                                    passed out of his hands, they must take their chance in common
                                    with native goods, and bear whatever impositions the rapacity or
                                    necessities of Chinese administration may inflict.</p>
                                <p>It must also be remembered that the imperfect execution of the
                                    treaty of Tien-tsin in this particular is due not alone to the
                                    weakness or inaction of the Chinese government, but also to the
                                    fraudulent evasion by British merchants of the obligations and
                                    conditions which it imposed.</p>
                                <p>My lords refer to the sale of transit certificates to the
                                    Chinese, by which malpractice the difficulties in the way of a
                                    just administration were greatly increased. A stricter execution
                                    of the stipulation on the English side should be, if possible,
                                    enforced, as well as on the part of China.</p>
                                <p>Under these circumstances my lords are of opinion that the
                                    arrangement which, after much discussion and correspondence,
                                    appears to have been considered satisfactory by Sir R. Alcock,
                                    may be approved by her Majesty’s government. The terms accepted
                                    by the Yamên seem in themselves perfectly equitable, and
                                    entirely in accordance with what my lords believe to have been
                                    the intention of the stipulation to which it relates. It is to
                                    be hoped that the renewed adhesion of the Chinese government to
                                    the principle therein asserted, and the measures which they
                                    propose to take with a view of making known and enforcing the
                                    provisions of the stipulation, will operate in diminishing and
                                    restraining, if not in removing, the obstructions caused to the
                                    circulation of foreign-owned goods in the interior by the
                                    exactions of the provincial governments.</p>
                                <p>The general character and principles of this arrangement are
                                    summed up by Mr. Hart, in his letter to Sir R. Alcock of 25th
                                    July, 1868, as follows:</p>
                                <p>“1. To allow all foreign goods to circulate freely on payment of
                                    import duty and transit due together.</p>
                                <p>“2. To enable all Chinese produce to get to foreign markets,
                                    after payment of transit due and export duty simply.</p>
                                <p>“3. To place native produce, with the exception of government
                                    monopolies, such as <pb n="326" xml:id="pg_326" facs="0360"
                                    />salt, to be traded in, in China, on the same footing as it is
                                    when traded in, in China, by Chinese.”</p>
                                <p>These general principles appear to my lords to have been observed
                                    in the arrangements ultimately proposed by the Chinese
                                    government, and they think they should receive the approval of
                                    her Majesty’s government, subject to any modifications of the
                                    details which further experience may have led Sir R. Alcock to
                                    deem desirable.</p>
                                <p rend="center">2. <hi rend="smallcaps">Free admission of ship and
                                        dock stores, etc.</hi></p>
                                <p>By the second rule of the agreement of Shanghai of the 8th
                                    November, 1858, under the head of ‘‘duty-free goods,” foreign
                                    clothing, household stores, ship stores, personal baggage,
                                    &amp;c., are exempted already. It is proposed to extend this
                                    exemption to dock stores and to all articles destined for
                                    foreign consumption exclusively, and not for sale to Chinese.
                                    This is a very liberal concession.</p>
                                <p rend="center">3. <hi rend="smallcaps">The repayment of drawbacks
                                        in money during any current quarter.</hi></p>
                                <p>Sir R. Alcock appears to have done his best to obtain a longer
                                    term for the repayment of drawbacks in specie, but the Chinese
                                    government decline such extension on grounds which are
                                    plausible, and as the concession is proposed without any
                                    limitation of the time during which certificates of drawback may
                                    be received in payment of import duty, it is a new facility
                                    accorded to foreign trade, and is so far satisfactory.</p>
                                <p rend="center">4. <hi rend="smallcaps">The establishment of bonded
                                        warehouses at the ports where they are desired.</hi></p>
                                <p>This measure will greatly diminish any inconveniences resulting
                                    from the regulations with respect to drawbacks, and afford, it
                                    is hoped, valuable facilities to trade. Sir R. Alcock is fully
                                    alive to the importance of establishing such warehouses on a
                                    proper system, and with the coöperation of Mr. Hart my lords
                                    have much confidence in the probable results.</p>
                                <p rend="center">5. <hi rend="smallcaps">The reduction of tariff on
                                        certain articles.</hi></p>
                                <p>My lords gather from the correspondence, and especially from the
                                    “memorandum on tariff revision for communication to Tsungli
                                    Yamên of the 5th of September, 1868,” by Sir R. Alcock, that he
                                    is of opinion that a general revision of the tariff is at the
                                    present time undesirable, and that as the Chinese government
                                    will not consent to a reduction of duty on the twelve articles
                                    enumerated in the memorials, except on this condition, that it
                                    will be better to leave this question of tariff revision at rest
                                    for the present.</p>
                                <p>My lords are much disposed to concur in this view; but they would
                                    have been glad of more information as to the incidence of the
                                    export duty on tea.</p>
                                <p>The Foo-chow memorial declares the average amount of the tax to
                                    be 10 per cent., and the Amoy memorial estimates it on common
                                    kinds at 35 per cent.</p>
                                <p>On the other hand it has been made a subject of discussion
                                    between Sir R. Alcock and Mr. Hart, whether the export duties on
                                    tea and silk might not be equitably raised in the interest of
                                    the Chinese revenue; and as this is a question of very great
                                    importance, as affecting in a vital manner our commercial
                                    relations with China, it is essential that there should be no
                                    hesitation as to the language which should be held on the
                                    subject by her Majesty’s representative in China.</p>
                                <p>The price of China tea in bond in the United Kingdom has arisen
                                    from 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2½<hi rend="italic">d.</hi> in

                                    degree, to the stimulus given to consumption by the reduction of
                                    the British import duty.</p>
                                <p>If any attempt were made by the Chinese government to impose
                                    heavier export duties on this article it would entirely
                                    neutralize the policy of her Majesty’s government in their
                                    endeavor to relieve the English consumer from taxation in an
                                    article of primary necessity, and transfer a profitable revenue
                                    from the British to the Chinese treasury.</p>
                                <p>On the other hand, the position of her Majesty’s government on
                                    this question is one which cannot be defended on any ground of
                                    reason or equity. To insist on the Chinese government confining
                                    their tax on tea to 5 per cent., in order that the British
                                    government may be enabled to impose 30 per cent, on its
                                    importation into the United Kingdom, is a course which could
                                    only be taken with a government which yields to force and not to
                                    argument.</p>
                                <p>But, nevertheless, an increased export duty on tea in China would
                                    be equally injurious both to our fiscal and commercial
                                    interests; for as tea constitutes the most important of the two
                                    only articles of trade largely exported by China to this
                                    country, and as the value of the goods exported from the United
                                    Kingdom and from British India to China exceeds already the
                                    value of the goods exported by China to the <pb n="327"
                                        xml:id="pg_327" facs="0361"/>United Kingdom and to British
                                    India, a still greater character of inequality and uncertainty
                                    would be imparted to the China trade than that which even now
                                    exists.</p>
                                <p>Any discussion, therefore, at present, which is calculated to
                                    raise such a question, should, in my lords’ opinion, be
                                    deprecated.</p>
                                <p>An increase in the export duty on silk, though not involving the
                                    same fiscal difficulty, would, on commercial grounds, be
                                    scarcely less unfavorable; and as this is a question in which
                                    France and other countries are equally interested, her Majesty’s
                                    government stands in a less invidious position with respect to
                                    it.</p>
                                <p>It is to be regretted that the Chinese government persist in

                                    hence this system may be extended higher up the river, as there

                                <p>The policy of urging on the Chinese government this measure is
                                    one upon which very different opinions are entertained. The
                                    mercantile body in China, as represented in the memorials are,
                                    on the whole, rather unfavorable to any great extension of the
                                    number of treaty ports; but as such a measure would have for its
                                    object rather the creation of new openings for trade and the
                                    introduction of new competitors into the field of enterprise
                                    than the benefit of existing interests, my lords are not
                                    surprised at the attitude of the memorialists on this
                                    question.</p>
                                <p>This opinion is, however, shared by Mr. Winchester and Mr.
                                    Robertson, and other persons of experience in China, and is
                                    supported by many arguments which appeal to my lords to possess
                                    much weight, both on political and commercial grounds, to which
                                    they will advert further on.</p>
                                <p>Mr. Hart, on the other hand, as representing the interests of the
                                    Chinese revenue, as well as on other grounds, expresses the
                                    strongest opinion in favor of a considerable extension of the
                                    treaty-port system. Mr. Wade, whose opinion is entitled to even
                                    greater weight, has expressed the same view, and attaches very
                                    great importance to this measure, which he evidently regards as
                                    the soundest and most legitimate method of increasing and
                                    consolidating our commercial relations with China.</p>
                                <p>Sir R. Alcock holds a middle course between these opposite views,
                                    and evidently thinks that much may be said on both sides.</p>
                                <p>My lords are of opinion that if it were held to be desirable to
                                    endeavor at the present time to extend materially our treaty
                                    relations with China, it is in this direction that such efforts
                                    should be made; and they think it probable that by the creation
                                    of well-selected new ports a certain expansion of foreign trade
                                    would be produced.</p>
                                <p>Such a policy, however, appears to my lords to be attended with
                                    so much doubt at the present moment, and the interest of the
                                    Chinese government is so clearly in the direction of taking the
                                    initiative in its adoption, that they are indisposed to
                                    recommend that any pressure should be placed on the government
                                    at Pekin by her Majesty’s government on this question, so that
                                    the responsibilities attendant upon such a measure should thus
                                    be made to rest upon the Chinese themselves.</p>
                                <p>If new ports are opened to foreign trade at the instance of her
                                    Majesty’s government it will probably be found necessary to
                                    create consular establishments at them, whether these are really
                                    essential in the interests of British trade or not; and although
                                    it may be desirable under the present conditions of foreign
                                    trade in China that, as a general rule, consuls should be
                                    stationed at all open ports, this may not always be the case,
                                    and will probably become less and less important as the function
                                    of distributing foreign goods in China passes more and more into
                                    the hands of native merchants.</p>

                                <p>On every ground it will be better that the hands of her Majesty’s
                                    government should be kept perfectly free in this respect, so
                                    that in the extension of the consular system in China they may
                                    be guided by the proved, and not by the anticipated,
                                    requirements of British trade and shipping.</p>
                                <p>It is beyond the province of government to détermine beforehand
                                    the places which the future course of trade may enable to assert
                                    a claim for consular establishments, and the only safe and just
                                    principle to be observed in providing new consulates is to
                                    create them only in places at which experience has shown that
                                    the trade both demands and justifies them.</p>

                                    would have been safer not to accept it. It will, in their
                                    opinion, be necessary that any British vessels which may engage
                                    in this trade should be placed under strict guarantees for good

                                    under treaty rights, until the Chinese are more familiar with
                                    these modern agencies, and the native merchants are themselves

                                    risk, and when it is recollected that the coast trade of the
                                    United Kingdom was only opened to foreign ships in 1849, and
                                    that in one of the most civilized countries in Europe, and in

                                    steam, are excluded even from the coasting trade, they think the

                                    quite unreasonable, and they are disposed to regret the pressure

                                    to induce the Chinese government to yield to the British
                                    representations.</p>
                                <p>These are—</p>
                                <p>1. The right of residence by foreigners in the interior, with
                                    that of renting stores and godowns at great internal
                                    centers.</p>
                                <p>2. The introduction by foreigners of railroads and telegraphs,
                                    and of steam navigation on lakes and inland waters.</p>
                                <p>3. The right to work mines in the vicinity of ports.</p>
                                <p>While giving full credit to Sir E. Alcock for the general
                                    moderation of tone, and for the great patience, care, and
                                    ability which he has displayed throughout these difficult
                                    negotiations, and bearing in mind the strong pressure which has
                                    been placed upon him by his colleagues and countrymen in China,
                                    my lords are unable to regret his failure in obtaining
                                    concessions from the Chinese government on these points.</p>
                                <p>They believe that the first of these, viz., right of residence in
                                    the interior of China, accompanied, as it must at present be, by
                                    “exterritoriality” would be attended with grave political danger
                                    and very doubtful commercial advantage, even if the former did
                                    not ensue.</p>
                                <p>The case might be more easily dealt with if China were treating
                                    with only one foreign power, although even here my lords would
                                    have advised that efforts in this direction should have received
                                    no assistance from her Majesty’s government; but with England,
                                    Russia, the United States of America, France, Germany, and other
                                    countries all in the field and all claiming exterritorial
                                    privileges, and all with their own ideas of policy and
                                    administration, it appears to them that nothing could be more
                                    directly calculated to bring about anarchy and confusion.</p>
                                <p>Even at the ports where foreigners are under the immediate
                                    control of their own officials, their “exterritoriality,” as Mr.
                                    Hart justly observes, exercises, in some respects, a harmful,
                                    because disintegrating, influence; and my lords think that there
                                    is much force expressed in the opinion of that gentleman that,
                                    “if China consents to this demand she will have sown the seeds
                                    of a wrong principle, which must grow in strength, and that
                                    strength and the new life thus given to the exterritorial idea
                                    in the interior will bring weakness for the nation and death for
                                    its government, and must eventuate in greater anarchy than has
                                    yet been seen.”</p>
                                <p>My lords cannot believe in the expediency of the introduction of
                                    railroads and telegraphs by foreigners under treaty right. All
                                    that could, as they think, be properly attempted in these
                                    respects would be to obtain permission, under very strict
                                    limitations aud conditions, to make experiments of this nature
                                    in particular districts, in such a manner as to afford a
                                    reasonable belief that they would lead to their adoption by the
                                    Chinese.</p>
                                <p>But in these matters, as well as in the case of steam navigation
                                    in inland waters, to which they have already referred, my lords
                                    believe that any general scheme of such improvements and
                                    innovations should be, at all events nominally, conducted by the
                                    Chinese themselves.</p>
                                <p>Similar objections apply, with more or less force, to the right
                                    of working mines by foreigners, and my lords would not recommend
                                    that any renewed attempt should be made at present to obtain
                                    privileges of this description.</p>

                                    <p>The dangers to which maritime commerce with China is exposed
                                        by reason of the piracy which is so boldly and adroitly
                                        carried on in the Chinese waters, years ago induced the
                                        maritime powers, as your excellency is aware, to send war
                                        vessels to cruise in those waters, whose task it was to
                                        protect commerce against pirates, and to exterminate piracy.
                                        The two corvettes cruising in those waters which belong to
                                        the war navy of the Union have, moreover, been furnished
                                        with the necessary instructions for an active participation
                                        in enterprises directed against piracy. They will be
                                        reinforced by several vessels of light draught, peculiarly
                                        adapted to the pursuit of piratical junks, which will
                                        probably be able, at no very distant day, to sail for their
                                        place of destination.</p>
                                    <p>These matters have led to the consideration of the question
                                        whether it would not be for the common interest of the
                                        powers engaged in the China trade to inaugurate a plan of
                                        combined action, to be settled by previous arrangement
                                        between the various governments, or between the commanders
                                        of the several squadrons. The representative of Great
                                        Britain in China proposed such a plan in 1868, and the
                                        unsatisfactory results of the system hitherto followed seem
                                        to speak in favor of this plan. It has, however, not been
                                        put into execution.</p>
                                    <p>I therefore most respectfully request your excellency to make
                                        inquiry, confidentially, with regard to the inclination of
                                        the government of the United States of America to
                                        participate in the realization of this idea, and to be
                                        pleased to communicate the result to me.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Count von Bismarck, chancellor of the
                            North German Union, has, through Baron von Gerolt, requested this
                            Government to participate in a combined action of the powers engaged in
                            the China trade <pb n="332" xml:id="pg_332" facs="0366"/>against the
                            pirates in the Chinese waters, to be settled either by previous
                            arrangements between the governments, or between the commanders of the
                            several squadrons.</p>
                        <p>Baron von Gerolt has further informed this Department that her Britannic
                            Majesty’s representative at Washington has been notified by his
                            government that the British admiralty will give, or has given, orders to
                            the British naval commander in China to coöperate with the commanders of
                            the naval forces of North Germany, and of other maritime powers in
                            China, in combined measures for this object.</p>
                        <p>Baron von Gerolt has been informed by this Department that the President
                            will take great pleasure in complying with the request of Count
                            Bismarck, by directing instructions to be issued from the Navy
                            Department to Admiral Rogers to coöperate for such purpose with the
                            naval forces of North Germany, and with the representatives of such
                            other powers as shall receive similar instructions. He has also been
                            informed that the coöperation of Admiral Rogers, and of the forces under
                            his command, will be limited to cases of recognized piracy; that the
                            admiral will be instructed to proceed in such a way as not to wound the
                            sensibilities of the Chinese government, or to interfere with the lawful
                            commerce of Chinese subjects, or to conflict with the peaceful policy
                            toward China in which the governments of North Germany and the United
                            States so happily agree.</p>
                        <p>In asking you to so instruct Admiral Rogers, I beg to add a few
                            suggestions.</p>
                        <p>The present relations between the United States and China are unusually
                            amicable. The policy inaugurated by Mr. Burlingame and Mr. Seward at
                            Washington, whereby the Chinese Empire was placed on the footing of the
                            civilized states of the west, and recognized as an organized central
                            power, was essentially an American policy in its inception, and is so
                            regarded in the Chinese mind. From the best information which this
                            Department can obtain, this policy is one calculated to increase
                            American influence and interests in China. It meets with the opposition
                            of the British merchants and traders in China, who look upon it as a
                            restraint upon their commerce and legitimate influence. The late
                            revision of the British treaty, which has been made in the spirit of the
                            new policy, is also opposed by the British resident merchants, with
                            almost unanimity. Strong memorials have been sent from Hong Kong and
                            Shanghai to Lord Clarendon to prevent its ratification.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, this Department is informed by Mr. Seward, the consul
                            general at Shanghai, that the ratification of that revision will benefit
                            American interests in China. It is therefore desirable to do nothing
                            which can imperil either the continuance of what is known as the
                            Burlingame policy or the substantial ratification of the British
                            revision.</p>
                        <p>It is not impossible that the British merchants in China, who, with the
                            other foreign merchants on that coast, constitute the only society to
                            which British officers in port have access, may, unconsciously to
                            themselves, impress upon the British naval officers their views of the
                            Chinese character and government, and of the policy to be pursued toward
                            the latter. I can conceive that the judgment of a British officer under
                            such circumstances may be warped, and that he may be induced to commit
                            acts which are not in harmony with the policy which the United States
                            desire to observe.</p>
                        <p>Admiral Rogers, when asked to coöperate with the British forces in the
                            suppression of piracy, should, therefore, be satisfied that the supposed
                            pirates are not innocent native traders or sailors; that they are <pb
                                n="333" xml:id="pg_333" facs="0367"/>not part of a native government
                            force; that they are, in fact, what they are said to be—recognized
                            pirates. He should especially be careful to do nothing to weaken the
                            influence which the United States has justly acquired through its
                            peaceful policy. He should not allow himself to be drawn into
                            precipitating an armed collision between China and any of the western
                            powers. And whenever he has reason to suppose that his desired
                            coöperative action may affect our political relations with China, he
                            should seek the advice of the diplomatic representative of the United
                            States at Pekin, who will be at all times possessed with the views of
                            this Department.</p>
                        <p>Thus forewarned and prevented from becoming the unconscious instrument
                            for carrying out purposes in conflict with the views of this Government,
                            it is to be hoped that it may be the good fortune of Admiral Rogers, and
                            of those under his command, to eradicate from the Chinese waters the
                            pirates who have been so long a scourge upon the commerce of the world.
                            I may add that the North German government is in full accord with this
                            Government in its oriental policy, and has at all times expressed to Mr.
                            Bancroft its wish to harmonize the instructions to its diplomatic and
                            naval representatives with those emanating from the United States
                            authorities.</p>
                        <p>As to Admiral Rogers’s suggestion that some instructions be given for
                            opening negotiations with Corea, for a treaty to regulate the treatment
                            of shipwrecked seamen, I have to say that that subject has occupied the
                            attention of this Department for some months. In April, 1868, it was
                            first brought to the favorable notice of my predecessor, Mr. Seward, by
                            Mr. George F. Seward, the consul general at Shanghai, and has been from
                            time to time since then the subject of correspondence. It would appear
                            from the dispatches of the consul general that about that time the
                            Shenandoah made an expedition to the Corea. It is possible that the
                            dispatches of the commander of that vessel in the archives of the Navy
                            Department may throw some light upon the subject.</p>
                        <p>This Department is prepared to instruct the minister of the United States
                            at Pekin to open negotiations with the government of Corea for the
                            conclusion of such a treaty. It is thought best to intrust this duty to
                            the diplomatic representative of the United States instead of the
                            admiral of the fleet, because the political relations, between China and
                            Corea are such as to make it desirable to first obtain the good will and
                            possibly the good offices of the Chinese government. Full instructions
                            will be forwarded to Mr. Low by an early post. Mr. Seward may also be
                            directed to accompany the expedition should he return to his post in
                            time to do so.</p>
                        <p>This Department asks that instructions may be given to Admiral Rogers to
                            place himself in communication with Mr. Low, soon after his arrival in
                            Chinese waters, and to agree with him upon a time when he shall
                            transport that gentleman to Corea. It is hoped that the expedition will
                            be sufficiently formidable to make an impression upon the native
                            authorities, and that Admiral Rogers will accompany it in person. Mr.
                            Low will be instructed to counsel and advise with him with the utmost
                            frankness and confidence in every stage of the negotiation.</p>
                        <p>Should, unhappily, any cause for hostilities occur during this mission,
                            it is hoped that the Navy Department will instruct Admiral Rogers in
                            such case to advise with Mr. Low, and to leave with this Department the
                            responsibility of war or peace.</p>

                            North German Union, has, through Baron von Gerolt, requested this
                            Government to participate in a combined action of the powers engaged in
                            the China trade against the pirates in the Chinese waters, to be settled
                            either by previous arrangements between the governments or between the
                            commanders of the several squadrons.</p>
                        <p>Baron von Gerolt has further informed this Department that her Britannic
                            Majesty’s representative at Washington has been notified by his
                            government that the British admiralty will give, or have given, orders
                            to the British naval commander in China to coöperate with the commanders
                            of the several forces of North Germany, and of other maritime powers in
                            China, in combined measures for this object.</p>
                        <p>Baron von Gerolt has been informed by this Department that the President
                            will take great pleasure in complying with the request of Count
                            Bismarck, by directing instructions to be issued from the Navy

                            other powers as shall receive similar instructions. This Department has,
                            accordingly, requested the Navy Department to issue such instructions to
                            Admiral Rogers and instructions have gone out in accordance with that

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> It has been decided to authorize
                            negotiations to be had with the authorities of Corea, for the purpose of
                            securing a treaty for the protection of shipwrecked mariners, and to
                            intrust the conduct of the negotiations to you. Should the opportunity
                            seem favorable for obtaining commercial advantages in Corea, the
                            proposed treaty should include provisions to that effect; but the
                            President principally aims in this mission to secure protection and good
                            treatment to such seamen of the United States as may unhappily be
                            wrecked upon those shores.</p>
                        <p>The inclosed copies of the treaties concluded with Japan at Kanagawa in
                            1854, and at Yedo in 1858, will serve to point out the kind of
                            protection which you will seek to secure as well as the commercial
                            articles which it may be desirable to enter into. These copies, together
                            with the copies of dispatches from Consul General Seward, which are
                            inclosed, indicate fully what you are to endeavor to obtain.</p>
                        <p>Little is known of the shores or internal waters of Corea, or of the <pb
                                n="335" xml:id="pg_335" facs="0369"/>people who inhabit that
                            country. Before leaving to carry out these instructions, you will
                            endeavor to gather all the information on these subjects that can be
                            obtained in Pekin. Some political connection exists between China and
                            Corea, which may make it advisable for you to secure, in advance, the
                            good will and, possibly, the good offices of the Pekin government. You
                            will, of course, do whatever can be done in that way.</p>
                        <p>Admiral Rogers will receive instructions, a copy of which has been
                            forwarded you in my No. 8 from the Navy Department, to place at your
                            disposal accommodation upon the flag-ship, and to accompany you himself
                            upon this mission, with a display of force adequate to support the
                            dignity of this Government. You will maintain entire frankness and
                            unreserve with Admiral Rogers, conferring freely with him in every stage
                            of the negotiations.</p>
                        <p>In arranging the time for carrying out these instructions, it is also
                            desirable, if possible, to secure the presence and coöperation of Consul
                            General Seward, who has had great experience in oriental character, and
                            who has also made a study of this question. Admiral Rogers has
                            instructions to take that officer with him in case he returns to China
                            before you go. It is not supposed here that you will be able to comply
                            with these instructions before next year, in which case Mr. Seward will
                            probably be at his post.</p>
                        <p>It will also be necessary in making your arrangements to consult the
                            convenience of Admiral Rogers, and to defer to his superior knowledge of
                            the best season for navigating those waters.</p>
                        <p>The Department relies upon you, in fulfilling these instructions, to
                            exercise prudence and discretion, to maintain firmly the right of the
                            United States to have their seamen protected, to avoid a conflict by
                            force unless it cannot be avoided without dishonor, and to seek in all
                            proper ways the harmonious and friendly assistance of the Chinese
                            government.</p>
                        <p>You will keep an account of your necessary expenses in carrying out these
                            instructions, and draw upon Messrs. Baring Brothers &amp; Co., of
                            London, for the amount thus expended, and furnish the necessary vouchers
                            therefor.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> Mr. Frederick Jenkins, a citizen of
                                the United States, formerly interpreter to this office, gives me the
                                following information:</p>
                            <p>There are now in Shanghai four Coreans and a bishop for Corea, of the
                                Romish Church. These persons have been sent here by the Corean
                                government. The purpose is to make inquiries concerning the state of
                                feeling existing toward Corea in regard to the alleged murder of
                                French priests and of the crew of the American schooner General
                                Sherman, with a view to determine whether it will be wise for the
                                Corean government to send an embassy to America and Europe to
                                explain those occurrences, and to make desired treaties of amity and
                                commerce. Mr. Jenkins expects to sail with these persons for the
                                Corea in a few days, and believes that the result of the report of
                                the commissioners and of his visit will be the sending of an
                                embassy, as proposed. He expects to return to Shanghai in about a
                                month, and that ambassadors, as indicated, will come with him.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Jenkins further informs me he is told the priests were executed
                                in punishment for schemes of theirs at the court.</p>
                            <p>The General Sherman trouble is explained as follows: That vessel had
                                reached a point in the interior on a river, of which he does not
                                know the name. Several of the crew went ashore and became embroiled
                                in a row growing out of the wrongful treatment of some women, and
                                were arrested. A force was then sent from the Sherman, which rescued
                                the men and took them on board, together with two native officers,
                                who, it is supposed, the master intended to hold as hostages. This
                                excited the people, and they attacked the vessel, killing eight
                                persons and capturing the others, who are still held.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Jenkins says that this information is known only to the
                                ambassadors and himself, to a Jewish merchant who has visited the
                                Corea several times, and by whom the commissioners were brought to
                                him, and to one other person who has necessarily been spoken to in
                                order to arrange for the charter of a steamer to proceed to Corea.
                                He assigns as reasons why he has been approached, the belief of the
                                Corean government that the proposed embassy would be more favorably
                                received in America than elsewhere, and should be sent there first;
                                and the fact that he is familiar with the Chinese language, which is
                                the written language of Corea. He is unable to explain how it
                                happens that the Corean government is now employing confidentially
                                the Romish bishop, one of a class they have so severely treated. He
                                expects to bring back with him those of the crew of the General
                                Sherman who are still living.</p>
                            <p>The Shenandoah has lately sailed from Cheefoo for the Corea to make
                                inquiry regarding the crew of the General Sherman, information
                                having been previously received which indicated that some of the
                                number are living.</p>
                            <p>It is difficult to say whether anything will be accomplished by her
                                commander. Mr. Jenkins says that the Coreans now here declare that
                                the visit will be useless.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: My dispatch No. 281, herewith, offers
                                information touching the General Sherman case, which has heretofore
                                engaged your attention. It is a subject for congratulation that it
                                is likely to be satisfactorily explained and any necessity for
                                hostile action averted. It is also satisfactory, if true, that the
                                Corean government is anxious to enter into treaties with the western
                                powers. The empire is independent, although it sends complimentary
                                tribute to Pekin. The population is said to be about six millions,
                                or one-third that of Japan. The climate is mild for the latitude.
                                The people are described as peaceful and industrious. In my opinion
                                there is no sufficient object attainable to render it advisable to
                                use force, or even the show of force, to procure a commercial treaty
                                with the Coreans. It may be considered, however, that the interests
                                of our shipping require that at least a treaty providing for the
                                kind treatment of shipwrecked people should be entered into. But if
                                the Coreans are prepared to go to the extent of opening up their
                                country to our merchants, this opportunity is not one that should be
                                lost.</p>
                            <p>I respectfully propose, therefore, in case the proposed embassy be
                                not concluded on, and it shall still seem desirable, on the receipt
                                of your instructions, that authority be given me to request of
                                Admiral Rowan the use of two vessels of war, (one like the
                                Shenandoah or Iroquois, the other smaller,) to employ one or more
                                interpreters, and to proceed to the Corea in order to ask an
                                official explanation of the Sherman affair, and <pb n="337"
                                    xml:id="pg_337" facs="0371"/>to negotiate, if possible, a treaty
                                of amity and of commerce similar to those now existing with China
                                and Japan, or such other lesser treaty as may be expedient and
                                attainable without the exercise or show of force.</p>
                            <p>If unsuccessful—and I am inclined to believe that the exercise of a
                                degree of discretion and patience would insure a more or less
                                complete success—the undertaking could do us no harm.</p>

                                the United States steamer Shenandoah, which left this port for Corea
                                on the 18th of March last, has returned to Cheefoo. The commander
                                had intercourse with officers at different points on the coast, but
                                learned nothing to corroborate the reports which have been prevalent
                                here that some of the crew of the General Sherman are still living,
                                and that the government is disposed to send an embassy to western
                                states. Mr. Jenkins has also returned. He had frequent communication
                                with the Corean officers, and virtually confirms the information
                                brought by the Shenandoah. Whatever causes may be at work in Corea,
                                I am now led to believe that no negotiations, hot supported by a
                                considerable show of force, would be likely to be successful.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> On the 24th April I had the honor to
                                advise you, in my dispatch No. 281, that I had received information
                                from Mr. F. Jenkins which indicated that some of the crew of the
                                schooner General Sherman were still living and held in custody in
                                Corea, and that the Corean government was anxious to enter into
                                negotiations for treaties of amity and commerce with the several
                                western powers: and on the 25th May I had again the honor to inform
                                you, in my dispatch No. 262, of the visit of the Shenandoah to
                                Corea, and of the return of Mr. Jenkins and that their further
                                information indicated that there was no reason to believe that any
                                of the crew of the Sherman were still surviving, or that the Coreans
                                were desirous of entering into relations with western states as
                                alleged.</p>
                            <p>At the date of writing the latter dispatch I had become aware that
                                the party with which Mr. Jenkins proceeded to Corea had been engaged
                                in an attempt to take from their tombs the remains of one or more
                                sovereigns of that country for the purpose, it would seem, of
                                holding them for ransom. I therefore entered upon an investigation
                                of the facts with a view to determine the nature of Mr. Jenkins’s
                                connection with the expedition, and whether I ought to prosecute
                                him. I regret to inform you that the information gathered by me has
                                convinced me that it is my duty to do so. The indictment which I
                                have caused to be prepared I inclose herewith. The trial will
                                proceed in a few days, and I shall transmit to you a full copy of
                                the minutes. The consuls of other powers concerned await the result
                                of my action before determining whether to proceed against their
                                nationals.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I wrote to you on the 28th ultimo,
                                giving a general statement of my impressions touching the Corean
                                question. Having now had the benefit of consultations with Messrs.
                                Browne and Van Valkenburgh and with Admiral Rowan, I propose to
                                offer some brief remarks bearing on the propriety of our sending a
                                mission to Corea, and its form. They will doubtless touch
                                considerations which you have already duly weighed, but perhaps
                                something may be added which will prove of interest to you.</p>
                            <p>The first object of a mission would be to procure information of the
                                loss or destruction of the American schooner General Sherman, and in
                                case the reports of the wrongful treatment of the crew prove
                                correct, indemnity or satisfaction therefor. I shall not dwell on
                                this point further than to say, that it cannot be well to let pass
                                uninvestigated a matter which there is reason to believe may have
                                been a very grave outrage on a vessel and persons sailing under our
                                flag; that all our efforts to procure information <pb n="338"
                                    xml:id="pg_338" facs="0372"/>have hitherto resulted not
                                altogether satisfactorily, and that there seems no way to procure
                                perfect information except by direct communication with the Corean
                                government.</p>
                            <p>On the other hand, there is something due from us to the Coreans. We
                                should assure them of our appreciation of their kindness to the
                                wrecked crew of the Surprise in 1866, and disposed as we are not
                                only to assert our dignity, but as well our intent to deal justly,
                                we cannot be indifferent to the propriety of offering to Corea an
                                explanation of our views and conduct in regard to the recent
                                expedition of an armed force for the purpose of exhuming and holding
                                for ransom the remains of one or more sovereigns of that country, in
                                which one of our citizens has been charged as a leader. It is
                                satisfactory to know that we have only to ask from Corea proof that
                                she has dealt as honorably with us in the Sherman case as we have
                                with her in the latter matter.</p>
                            <p>The second object is to obtain a treaty. I have hesitated to say that
                                there is one adequate object to render it perfectly desirable to
                                procure a general commercial treaty. Commercial intercourse with
                                states where we take on ourselves the responsibility of protecting
                                and altogether controlling our nationals, and where the result of
                                intercourse is the introduction of ideas and forces calculated to
                                work changes that may not be gradual and benign, but may upturn in a
                                revolutionary way the existing order of government and even of
                                society, is not to be inconsiderately sought, But all my reflection
                                leads me to believe that it will be well for us to make the attempt.
                                We have three ports of China in the Gulf Pechili much frequented by
                                our vessels. There are three of Japan on the west coast similarly
                                available to us. Right down between these juts the Corean peninsula.
                                The steamers of the northern branch of the Pacific mail line run for
                                a distance almost within sight of the coast of the peninsula. To the
                                north of Corea stretch away possessions of Russia, having the river
                                Amoor as a natural channel and guide of their commerce to the
                                Pacific. Here are regions of China, Japan, and Siberia, which have
                                already a considerable trade. Within a year or two coal will be
                                extensively worked in each, and it will soon be no longer necessary
                                to bring this indispensable article in the navigation of the present
                                day around the Cape of Good Hope. Thereupon will follow a
                                development of trade here, which will, I think, surprise the most
                                sanguine.</p>
                            <p>Centrally situated, midway in the long stretch of the eastern Asiatic
                                coast, with foreign vessels already skirting her shores in very
                                considerable numbers, Corea cannot hope to exclude foreigners much
                                longer, nor can it be possible that, with a mild climate and a large
                                and industrious population, commerce would not, under favorable
                                auspices, flourish in her cities.</p>
                            <p>France has been unfortunate in Corea. Great Britain has hardly a
                                greater interest at stake than we, and no grievances to redress.
                                North Germany, with her increasing commerce and great fleet of
                                coasting crafts, has yet no determined policy in the East. We are
                                favorably known, and all the circumstances indicate that an attempt
                                to open the country may best be made by us.</p>
                            <p>But whether a general treaty is desirable or not there can, in my
                                opinion, be no question of the need of one that shall provide for
                                the safety of seamen and others wrecked or driven on the Corean
                                coast. Indeed we can hardly consent that it shall remain peculiarly
                                dangerous to our navigation.</p>
                            <p>I remarked in the dispatch referred to in the outset, that the
                                settlement of the Sherman matter, and a treaty of the latter sort,
                                may, it seems to me, be obtained without great difficulty, but that
                                a considerable show of force would probably be needed to secure a
                                general treaty.</p>
                            <p>If the Coreans were excited by grossly wrong conduct on the part of
                                the Sherman crew to engage in a struggle with them, we may perhaps
                                be saved great trouble in this branch of the negotiation, and there
                                is enough in the general conduct of the Coreans to indicate that
                                they would not be greatly averse to giving us formal guarantees to
                                care for persons wrecked, and to arrange measures by which they
                                could be speedily returned to some hospitable district.</p>
                            <p>Touching the broader negotiations it may be assumed, generally, that
                                eastern states have a settled policy toward western powers which is
                                dictated by fear that intercourse will result disastrously; they
                                find occasion for this fear in the harsh lessons of the past, and in
                                the actual condition of a considerable portion of their continent.
                                And, indeed, China is only just emerging from an internal struggle
                                which has threatened most severely the controlling power of the
                                empire, while Japan is, at this moment, in the throes of
                                revolution—troubles which it would not be difficult to connect with
                                the introduction of foreigners.</p>
                            <p>There are arguments which may be advanced to show the Coreans that a
                                juster consideration of eastern states is prevailing in the west;
                                that China would not have encountered the rebellion had the
                                government been at all a wise one, while from the stranger
                                constitution of Japan the result of war was almost inevitable; that
                                foreign intercourse is in many ways desirable, and that it is surely
                                becoming unavoidable. It is indeed doubtful, however, whether there
                                can be found in Corea men able to weigh <pb n="339" xml:id="pg_339"
                                    facs="0373"/>justly the position of the state, and to bring
                                about, in face of all preconceptions and of conflicting interests,
                                the radical changes contemplated.</p>
                            <p>But it is to be said that these eastern peoples are not unalterably
                                wedded to old practices and institutions. Japan accepted Comodore
                                Perry’s peaceful but formidable mission without great opposition,
                                and of late all parties in that state have vied among themselves in
                                availing of foreign knowledge and material. China, naturally less
                                mobile by reason of her continental position, vast territory and
                                population, has been more consistent in all her history than Japan;
                                but she has not failed to acknowledge, from time to time, the force
                                of new ideas and circumstances, and, even with her, sweeping reforms
                                have been effected by peaceful means working from within. It may not
                                be altogether visionary, therefore, to hope that such a condition of
                                affairs may be found in Corea as will render it possible to attain
                                success without the exercise of force.</p>
                            <p>But, as intimated, I am disposed to think it desirable, if a mission
                                is to be sent to Corea, that it should be provided with a number of
                                vessels. Reasons are so obvious that I will not dwell to review
                                them. But of course I contemplate only the display of force, not its
                                use, and not even intimations that it may be used. I know well there
                                should be no irregular action; and that it will be time enough for
                                the United States to determine on the exercise of force when
                                peaceful efforts shall have been exhausted, and all the
                                circumstances broadly considered.</p>
                            <p>A mission, then, such as the one I have indicated, will require a
                                cordial coöperation with the navy. Fortunately this is perfectly
                                within reach. Admiral Rowan has himself proposed to me that
                                authority and instructions in our joint names to prosecute the
                                mission shall be applied for. He has a not large fleet, but one
                                perhaps sufficient, since Corea is so near at hand, to enable him to
                                look out for the general interest of the station, and at the same
                                time to spare a few vessels for the particular purpose. I have
                                favored this proposition and have now to ask for it your
                                consideration. While I have indicated one advantage only that would
                                be secured by this course, I do not wish to say that the expedition
                                might not be well left in the admiral’s hands. There are numerous
                                precedents for deputing such authority to a naval
                                commander-in-chief, and the instances are not few in which that
                                course has resulted most satisfactorily. Yet I think the admiral
                                would prefer to be associated with me. And looking to the facts that
                                such work naturally belongs to my own branch of the public service,
                                that I have the advantage of a not inconsiderable experience in
                                matters of eastern politics and trade, and that the negotiation may
                                cover over a considerable period, it seems well that we should be
                                associated, and this would be more satisfactory to me. But should
                                the President prefer to confer the authority upon the admiral alone
                                I shall, remembering that the general objects, and not individual
                                preferences or ambitions, are to be consulted, render to him any
                                assistance within my power that he may wish.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> It is well known that the principles on
                            which our intercourse with China has for many years been conducted have
                            been clearly defined by the mission of Mr. Burlingame, and that this
                            demonstration of them has drawn forth grave remonstrances from the mass
                            of foreigners on the spot. The principles referred to appear
                            authoritatively in the Seward-Burlingame treaty and the
                            Clarendon-Burlingame correspondence; the views of the merchants in the
                            addresses which they presented to Mr. Ross Browne.</p>
                        <p>I may state the former as follows: The United States and Great Britain
                            desire to acknowledge the perfect independence and general sovereignty
                            of China within her own borders, and to conform their intercourse with
                            her to the usual courses* <note n="*" xml:id="d222fn1">I have not chosen
                                to dwell here on the fact that the existing treaties do impair the
                                sovereignty of China; they have been made and accepted, and until
                                China complains of them, or they are otherwise shown to be
                                unnecessary, impolitic, or wrong, we need not greatly discuss them.
                                The proposition as stated touches only matters not dealt with in the
                                treaties or affected by them.</note>, that is to say, they will
                            respect <pb n="340" xml:id="pg_340" facs="0374"/>her territory and they
                            will not use force or threats of force to urge her on in the path of
                            progress, nor will they allow force to be used in the settlement of
                            disputes and claims, excepting as they would when dealing with a western
                            state.</p>
                        <p>To these fundamental principles the merchants take exception at length.
                            The sum of these objections is founded in the following sentences, which
                            I extract from the documents mentioned:</p>
                        <p>We believe that not only is there a right on the part of western states
                            to insist on steps that will further the cause of civilization in China,
                            but a clear duty in that direction; and that the advancement of China
                            without anarchy and rebellion cannot be had by waiting until her own
                            government is content to move. Lord Clarendon has laid down rules of
                            action for our ministers and consuls and our community, which would
                            prove entirely inadequate if any crisis occurred demanding extraordinary
                            measures.</p>
                        <p>The questions thus stated may be defined as follows:</p>
                        <p>1st. How may western states best promote the cause of civilization and
                            good government in China?</p>
                        <p>2d. How may they best protect the legitimate interests of their peoples
                            in that empire?</p>
                        <p>The one may be concisely termed the question of progress, the other that
                            of dealing with the central government. I shall treat them separately
                            and in the order above given.</p>
                        <p>When the merchants say that western states have the right, and add that
                            it is their duty, “to insist on steps that will further the cause of
                            civilization in China,” they seem to go a long way. If it is their right
                            they may support that right by force of arms. If it is their duty it may
                            be their duty to use arms. There was a time when European potentates
                            defended the claims of discoveries to and over great districts, and the
                            peoples inhabiting them. Discovery was enough to vest the title to
                            sovereignty, and lest the two greatest defenders of the faith should
                            thus come into collision the outside world was divided between them.</p>
                        <p>To Spain was awarded the regions of eternal youth, which the fancy of the
                            age believed to exist in the golden West. The East, scarcely inferior to
                            Europe in wealth and civilization, was awarded to the mariners of
                            Portugal. France and England as well adopted the theory, and contentions
                            arose out of it which led even to acts of war and woe. To this day the
                            nations of Europe would not hesitate to assume jurisdiction over islands
                            of the sea, or of districts not already taken possession of by western
                            states or advanced in power and civilization. It is only a few years
                            since one of the greatest men of France, M. Guizot, then secretary for
                            foreign affairs, in explaining the circumstances under which the French
                            mission to China of 1844, a peaceful one, was being sent out, declared
                            that if the interests of France should demand it the government would
                            not hesitate to seize an island on the coast of China. At a later date
                            France has pushed conquests in Cochin China. Russia is at this moment
                            extending her domains in Asia. England never fails for an excuse when it
                            is desirable to assume authority over the outlying states of her Indian
                            territory. Even America, when it suited her purpose, asked for access to
                            the ports of Japan. She used soft words, but a great fleet gave emphasis
                            to them.</p>
                        <p>In fact moderation has ever been observed when there has been the ability
                            to command respect. When this has not existed the interests, or supposed
                            interests, of greater states have never halted. Conquest and
                            aggrandizement have been the rule, and the observers of the rule have
                            not yet disappeared.</p>
                        <p>It is true that generally the purposes of western states are at the
                            present time more or less cloaked and covered over. When it was the <pb
                                n="341" xml:id="pg_341" facs="0375"/>aim of Napoleon to extend the
                            Latin power, he waited until Mexico seemed to ask for a foreign ruler.
                            When Great Britain wished to open several of the ports of China in 1839,
                            the seizure of a quantity of opium was made the excuse for a war which
                            accomplished the result. No concealment was. made, however, when, in
                            1857, it was concluded that to sustain friendly relations with China
                            access to the capital was indispensable. Townsend Harris argued with the
                            Japanese for privileges broader than those granted to Commodore Perry,
                            urging that what he asked as a favor would soon be demanded from behind
                            the hostile armaments of England and France. Nor are the advocates of
                            the use of force destitute of arguments. It is not well to attribute the
                            movements of the mercantile classes in China, for instance in the
                            direction of progress, to self-interest alone. The merchants know full
                            well that they are likely to be benefited by the extension of steam
                            navigation, to opening of coal and other mines, the construction of
                            railroads and telegraphs. But it is when they come to consider that
                            these measures are desirable chiefly in the native interests, and are
                            persistently rejected by the government, that their belief rises to the
                            height of strong political conviction, and they lose no opportunity to
                            impress their ideas upon the world.</p>
                        <p>I have lived for many years among foreigners in China. I believe that no
                            higher-minded, more honorable merchants than those engaged there can be
                            found in any land. I doubt whether, the members of any mercantile class
                            in the world are superior to them in origin and education. You will have
                            noticed the ability and earnestness with which they discuss the great
                            problems working out on the Asiatic coast. The views held may often be
                            mistaken ones; but this occurs through no lack of good disposition. It
                            is rather due to the special circumstances by which they are affected
                            and the intensity of their convictions.</p>
                        <p>It has not been my fortune to agree always in their views. I have no
                            hesitation, however, in paying them the tribute which I do. I conceive
                            that I am acting wisely when I review my own in deference to their
                            opinions. And highly as I respected the speaker, and much as I
                            sympathize with the generous views which he has enforced in America and
                            Europe, I deprecate Mr. Burlingame’s words when he calls them “opium
                            dealers.” In truth, foreign merchants in China are not opium dealers.
                            The opium traffic is confined to a small number of mercantile houses and
                            to Asiatic traders. From it the mass of merchants are as free as they
                            are from participation in the coolie trade or in the African slave
                            trade. So far as the acquaintance with the soberly-held ideas of the
                            leaders of commerce is concerned, I esteem my residence at Shanghai more
                            favorable than life at the isolated capital of China. I attribute not a
                            few of Mr. Burlingame’s disparaging remarks to the fact that he lived at
                            the capital, and only at rare intervals came in contact with his
                            countrymen at the ports.</p>
                        <p>I confess that I should think less of western civilization and of western
                            manhood if it were not pushing and aggressive in China. Take the average
                            American or Englishman used to well-kept roads and streets, to
                            well-policed towns, to the comforts, conveniences, and advantages of
                            steamships, telegraphs, and railoads, to all the benefits of lands where
                            private rights are perfectly respected, education is diffused and the
                            blessings of a high civilization are found, and put him down in China,
                            where there is not one carriage road; where there are no sewers nor
                            lamps in the towns; where telegraphs and railroads are unknown, and
                            steamers only where foreigners have forced them, a country which seems
                            to possess the fewest possible elements of accord with the enterprising
                            West, and he would be unworthy of the Anglo-Saxon blood which runs <pb
                                n="342" xml:id="pg_342" facs="0376"/>in his veins if he should teach
                            himself the Chinese habit of thought, and sit down to believe with the
                            immobile mass around him, that whatever is is best. I can use no
                            stronger language than that of Mr. Browne, when he says:</p>
                        <p>Whatever errors may be committed through misconception of facts or excess
                            of zeal, the cause of progress is one which appeals to the highest
                            sentiments of the Christian world. I look upon the movements, therefore,
                            as abounding in promises for the future. The best friends of China will
                            undoubtedly be those who can induce her to strengthen her organization,
                            and render herself able and worthy to maintain her position.</p>
                        <p>If it is asked, then, what are the arguments of this pressing mercantile
                            class in favor of the use or the demonstration of force, the answer is
                            ready: “The advancement of China without anarchy and rebellion,” they
                            say, “cannot be had by waiting until her government is ready to move.”
                            “The presence of foreigners is a protection and blessing to the people;
                            this presence is their only chance of improvement save through
                            desolating wars. It is in all probability the chief cause of the
                            existence of the present government, and perhaps of any government in
                            the country.”</p>
                        <p>This idea was expressed by me, more guardedly, however, six months before
                            the date of the memorial, (<hi rend="italic">vide</hi> my dispatch No.
                            345:)</p>
                        <p>It is manifest that the growing intercourse between Chinese and
                            foreigners in this and in other countries is bringing new forces into
                            action in this empire. We have already seen Japan revolutionized in
                            consequence of similar intercourse. The effect on the immensely greater
                            mass of Chinese society is slower but very certain. The people
                            aremoving, and unless the government keeps with them, or in advance, new
                            forms of administration or variations of existing forms will be sought
                            in a revolutionary way.</p>
                        <p>I confess that when I wrote the above, I entertained the idea that the
                            government would keep in advance, or, at least, with the movements of
                            its people. This belief had been shared by leading foreigners in China.
                            Mr. Hart, inspector general of maritime customs, who lives at the
                            capital, and whose relations with the government are more intimate than
                            those of any other foreigner, shared it. Mr. Burlingame was full of it.
                            Sir Rutherford Alcock entertained it so far that he supported the
                            mission which was to go out expressly to gain the assurances of western
                            powers that they would bide China’s time and not force progress on her.
                            We hear now from Mr. Hart, from Sir Rutherford, from the other
                            ministers, from the merchants, and from Mr. Browne, that this was a
                            mistake.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hart says:</p>
                        <p>Some forty officials in the provinces, and perhaps ten at Pekin, have a
                            glimmering notion of what the foreigner means when he speaks of
                            progress; but of those ten, not one is prepared to enter boldly on a
                            career of progress or to take the consequences of even a feeble
                            initiative.</p>
                        <p>Sir R. Alcock says:</p>
                        <p>There is no evidence here of a desire for progress. If any hopes are
                            built upon its existence, therefore, I fear there is nothing but
                            disappointment in store for those who indulge in them. Projectors of
                            telegraphic lines, railroads, and other plans for the sudden development
                            of the resources of this country are but losing their time, while the
                            government have shown no disposition to entertain their projects. I
                            think it is in the interest of all who are so occupied, that they should
                            know the truth, and not be deluded by false hopes and expectations of
                            changes which are still in the dim distance.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Browne says:</p>
                        <p>All that the rulers of this empire desire is to be left free to work out
                            their own destiny in their own way, and that is simply retrogression and
                            relapse into barbarism. They make small concessions to avert greater
                            ones; the whole struggle is against making any at all. I state this not
                            in the way of deprecation, but as an incontrovertible fact which we are
                            bound to confront. It is a subject for sympathy rather than <pb n="343"
                                xml:id="pg_343" facs="0377"/>complaint. A vast empire with an
                            industrious and inoffensive population is in many respects worthy of
                            esteem, in maintaining an unequal struggle to preserve its ancient
                            systems against the combined powers of the world.</p>
                        <p>This is unmistakable language. And it is not different from the
                            declarations which reach us from, other sources. From the merchants, the
                            professional men, and the officials at the ports, even from the highly
                            intelligent class of foreigners who are managing the maritime customs
                            department of the empire, we hear the same language, “China never has,
                            and never will progress except under pressure.”</p>
                        <p>A distinction is to be held in view here. Mr. Burlingame asserts with
                            emphasis that China does progress. He recites as evidence that foreign
                            trade increases from year to year. He quotes the fact that the Chinese
                            are building several arsenals. He calls attention to the existence of
                            the customs establishments. The so-called Pekin University points his
                            moral. In glowing language he declares that China invites Christendom
                            “to plant the shining cross on every hill and in every valley of her
                            broad domain.” I hold with him that China is progressing. Bu the case is
                            not such as persons not acquainted with the circumstances would
                            understand from his language.</p>
                        <p>There is, in truth, progress in China. It is, however, that which has
                            been forced on the empire and does not come from, a spontaneous desire
                            for improved methods. Trade developes there as it will in any land where
                            scope for effort is given. We have forced China to give us her teas and
                            silks, subject to certain defined rates of duty. We have forced her to
                            accept opium, cotton goods, &amp;c., subject to similar duties. The law
                            of supply and demand has been strong enough to work out the development
                            which we have seen. The government has done nothing, excepting, of
                            necessity, to foster trade. It is not many years since the governor of
                            the province of Kiang-see was dismissed from office because he said: “I
                            conceive it my duty to weigh well the advantage and disadvantage of this
                            or that order of proceeding, and if any measure be beneficial to China
                            and practicable, and does not violate law, I will assuredly not abide in
                            the smallest degree by standing prejudices.” But these are the only
                            works of progress which they are undertaking, and one object they have
                            in view is to strengthen existing institutions for a possible conflict
                            with foreigners. The customs establishment is one of the most promising
                            features of the progress of China. This was, however, urged on China by
                            France and England, to protect the lien which they had acquired upon,
                            the revenues of the state, and China, finding that she derived a better
                            result from the aid of foreign ers than she could when only natives were
                            employed, and perhaps con sidering that she might pit foreigners against
                            foreigners, has retained the service and extended it. The Pekin
                            University can only be said to have an existence. Missionaries may, in
                            virtue of treaty stipulations, travel and reside in any part of the
                            empire. These stipulations were, however, wrung from the Chinese by war,
                            and they are deterred from discrediting them by the fear of war.
                            Unoffending missionaries are frequently driven from places where they
                            have attempted to locate themselves, and the record of murdered ones is
                            a long one.</p>
                        <p>Instead of a picture of hopefulness, the merchants there draw of China
                            one of despair: “We claim,” they say, “that China as she stands is as
                            low in civilization as she is in wealth and power; that her history
                            teaches us little worth knowing, except maxims of morality, long reduced
                            by western nations to actual practice, but by China neglected and
                            forgotten; that her present state, so far from being an example, is a
                            warning of the results of a false system and a vicious policy.” And <pb
                                n="344" xml:id="pg_344" facs="0378"/>again they say: “It is almost
                            impossible for ns to convey to our fellow-countrymen at home a just idea
                            of the utter inability of the Chinese to comprehend any motives for
                            forbearance other than our own powerlessness or a fear of their growing
                            strength. It is our candid opinion that if the British and American
                            governments were in a position to estimate all the dangers that are
                            involved in their new policy, they would abandon it at once, in a state
                            of alarm at its probable consequences.”</p>
                        <p>If we grant that the merchants and the others quoted are right in their
                            estimate of the Chinese disposition and character, and if we acknowledge
                            the force of the descriptions which we continually read of the
                            imperfection of Chinese systems of thought, of religion, and of
                            government, it will be difficult to refrain from giving unqualified
                            sympathy to their ideas. If China is weak and worthless and perverse, we
                            must say, with the American moralist, “that while western governments
                            are bound to act a friendly, just, and generous part toward China, they
                            cannot forego the advantage of the moral influence of their greater
                            material powers;” and, with the British memorialist, “It is our earnest
                            wish that when you (Mr. Browne) return to the United States you may
                            endeavor to enlighten the public mind upon the real issues that are
                            raised by the existence of foreign intercourse with China, and upon the
                            most efficient means of introducing western civilization into this vast
                            empire;” and, with Mr. Browne, “Instead of attributing to the Chinese
                            either capacities or motives irreconciled with their whole history, and
                            with their present condition and limited intelligence, it is our duty to
                            enlighten and elevate them. But it is not by pandering to their
                            superstitions and their weaknesses that this is to be done. The strong
                            hand of pressure may be more humane in the end than flattering.”</p>
                        <p>I cannot regard the condition of China so hopeless as do the high
                            authorities I have quoted. What are the facts?</p>
                        <p>In the year 1840. there was no contact between China and the people of
                            the west, excepting the very limited intercourse carried on by a few
                            merchants at Canton. The empire was self-contained. To the northward
                            were great deserts; to the westward, impassable mountains; to the
                            southward, vast stretches of tropical jungles; and to the eastward, the
                            Pacific. Within these boundaries dwelled a people whose numbers were
                            estimated at 400,000,000. The neighboring states and districts—Corea,
                            Loochoo, Assam, Siam, Burmah, Thibet, Mantchooria, Mongolia—paid
                            voluntary tribute to her. The Emperor was surrounded with the halo of
                            deity. What wonder can we have that the state, prosperous beyond any of
                            her neighbors, should be called “The Central Flowery Kingdom,” and that
                            the Emperor should assume to have received, the “commands of Heaven to
                            sway, with paternal care, the peoples of all lands.”</p>
                        <p>The troubles of the merchants at Canton in that year brought on the war
                            of 1842, which led to the opening of four other ports to trade, viz.,
                            Amoy, Foochoo, Ningpo, and Shanghai. But the access of foreigners to the
                            empire was confined to those ports. There were given no rights to reside
                            or even to travel in the interior. Diplomatic representatives were
                            forbidden to go to the capital. Matters went on thus for fifteen years,
                            when at last the treaties of Tien-tsin, exacted by arms, gave foreigners
                            rights which were broad in comparison with those they had previously
                            held, but were still far short of the privileges which are extended in
                            any western state. Practically those treaties confine the foreign
                            merchant to a dozen or so ports, and beyond these the intercourse of
                            foreigners with natives is occasional and inconsiderable. The treaties
                            of Tientsin have existed twelve years. They take away from China a part
                            of <pb n="345" xml:id="pg_345" facs="0379"/>her natural sovereignty.
                            They give, in some directions, greater privileges to the foreigner than
                            the native has possessed. They introduce into the land an alien race,
                            bent on trade and on proselyting plans. They introduce, or seem to do
                            so, an obnoxious drug, which destroys the stamina of the people;
                            introduce it in such quantities that the state can barely produce tea
                            and silk enough—valuable commodities—to pay for it.</p>
                        <p>I assume, and the candid observer at a distance will not be likely to
                            dispute the point, that if China, during these twelve years, has even
                            passably well discharged her duties under the treaties; if she has even
                            passably well accommodated herself to her new, very strange, and very
                            irksome relations, she has done much. And if she has not egregiously
                            failed in the performance of her new obligations, and has only partially
                            accommodated herself to her new relations, I consider it reasonable to
                            hope that she will soon begin to appreciate the benefits which free
                            intercourse with western states is sure to bring to her, and to expect
                            that at no very distant clay we shall see telegraphs and railroads
                            stretching everywhere across the land, steam vessels plying on all her
                            waters, coal and other mines yielding forth desired riches, and the
                            whole land rousing itself from a lethargy which has seemed that of
                            ultimate decay.</p>
                        <p>I am prepared to say that I believe now, as I did two years ago, and as
                            did the most prominent men in China at that time, that she will attain
                            peaceably these, results. I believe that it will be so, but more than
                            this I cannot say. We cannot unravel the future and learn what is
                            mingled in its web. We can only exercise our judgment as to what is the
                            tendency and direction of existing forces, and the character of results
                            to be worked out under novel conditions.</p>
                        <p>If China were a state now as she was formerly, self-contained and
                            self-poised, if no forces were at work within her borders excepting
                            those originated by her own character and disposition, nor any outside
                            interference or intercourse were to be expected, I should say that she
                            might go on in the future much as she has in the past. Dynasty might
                            succeed dynasty, periods of misrule and anarchy might give place to
                            those of good government and order, to be succeeded again by eras of
                            pain and difficulty. The great pendulum of time might continue to swing
                            backward and forward, bringing with it, as heretofore, prosperity and
                            prostration. That has been the course of events in China for many
                            centuries, and so might continue indefinitely.</p>
                        <p>But there are other forces at work in China than those original with her
                            people. These forces are of the strongest, and they are so defended and
                            supported that they are left very free to work out normal results. The
                            bad dispositions of rulers may retard but they cannot stay them, the
                            natural qualities of the people may hinder but they cannot bar their
                            course. They are forces which will accommodate themselves greatly to
                            existing systems if not opposed, but if blind efforts are made to check
                            them they will sweep away whatever opposes. Institutions of government,
                            nay, whole races of men, will go down before them hereafter, as they
                            have heretofore, whenever the inevitable is not recognized but blindly
                            combated.</p>
                        <p>Let us consider the advantage these forces have in. China.</p>
                        <p>The treaties as they stand give the people of western nations the
                            following privileges:</p>
                        <p>1. To approach with their ships, to land or lade merchandise, to reside,
                            &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c., at twelve ports on the coast.</p>
                        <p>2. To navigate the Yang-tse River so far as Hankow, six hundred miles,
                            and to reside, &amp;c., &amp;e., &amp;e., at that and at three other
                            cities on the river.</p>
                        <pb n="346" xml:id="pg_346" facs="0380"/>
                        <p>3. To travel under a system of passports in the vessels or other
                            conveyances of the country, for purposes of business or of pleasure, to
                            all parts of the empire.</p>
                        <p>4. To send or take foreign goods into or bring foreign-owned produce from
                            the interior under a system of transit passes. The utility of this is
                            that they are thus enabled to pay a certain definite commutation, fixed
                            at one-half of the external tariff charge, in lieu of the taxes which
                            are levied, under the peculiar economy of the empire, on merchandise in
                            transit, at barriers established along the rivers, canals, and
                            highways.</p>
                        <p>Under these treaties, communities of foreigners have grown up at all the
                            places where they are allowed to live, and the trade of the empire
                            centers chiefly at these points. The carrying trade between the ports
                            and cities opened has been transferred to foreign bottoms. The Chinese
                            in their most distant marts have come to know, and more or less to use,
                            foreign fabrics, and these are so much esteemed that in some districts,
                            at least, whatever is best is known not as “superfine” but as “foreign.”
                            They are continually witnessing the voyages along their coast or on
                            their rivers of the sailing craft of the west, with which their own
                            vessels compare so unfavorably, and of great steamers which cannot but
                            be regarded by them as marvels of human ingenuity. They see at the ports
                            that foreigners live in houses of imposing size and appearance, in
                            circumstances of ease, convenience, and luxury unknown in their own
                            modest dwellings. They observe that these foreign communities are well
                            ordered, and must mark with astonishment the perfected arrangements of
                            the streets, and of the wharves and docks. They have occasion to go into
                            the foreign courts of law and learn that the maxims of morality and of
                            fair-dealing taught by their own sages, but nowhere in their land
                            greatly observed, are therein enforced. They witness great vessels of
                            war, any one of which would be able to combat an army, lying quietly in
                            their ports, a spectacle, elsewhere unknown to them, of power held in
                            check by perfect moderation. They see the forces of foreign states
                            leagued with their own to suppress internal disorders. They see an
                            important branch of the national revenues honestly administered by
                            foreign employés. They find that, when taught, they can themselves
                            manage skips, steamers, and machinery, and can even construct them.</p>
                        <p>The forces which have been thus fostered and defended, and have
                            accomplished so much, are, then, those which, proceeding out of high
                            stages of civilization, have effected amelioration in the condition of
                            the human race in Europe and America, and are destined yet to arouse
                            from their lethargy or overthrow the Asiatic and African races. There is
                            no staying them. Whatever may be the manner in which results will be
                            worked out in the various lands of the globe, that those results will be
                            accomplished no one in whose veins courses the quicker blood of the west
                            entertains a doubt.</p>
                        <p>The Chinaman is noted, moreover, for his sobriety, his industry, and his
                            peaceableness. No people, excepting one which needs the least control,
                            could present to the world the spectacle which China has for centuries.
                            In the west, until now, the existence of greatly extended states has
                            been impossible. China, without other than the simplest means of
                            communication, and unblessed by a good government, has been one and
                            undivided. Without extraordinary branches of industry, and no external
                            commerce, she has given her people the means of sustenance. A more quiet
                            peasantry does not exist. And while the people are thus docile, careful,
                            and thrifty, the theory of government is in many respects admirable, and
                            men of intelligence and breadth of views, according to <pb n="347"
                                xml:id="pg_347" facs="0381"/>their lights, exercise, or do from time
                            to time exercise, the sovereign control.</p>
                        <p>It would require much time to offer an explanation of the Chinese
                            governmental system. It is certainly, in theory, despotic. Practically,
                            however, it is liberal. The Emperor represents all authority and power.
                            The viceroys are his lieutenants; they are sent to their respective
                            districts, instructed to collect the revenues and to administer the
                            laws; they are given no imposing military support. The task assigned
                            them is to govern so that the ancient systems may be supported and the
                            people made content. Their conduct is not greatly scrutinized so long as
                            no murmurs come up. But when the people complain, the unsuccessful ruler
                            must make way for another. The result is a system which is democratic in
                            its working, if not in its salient features, and one well calculated to
                            bring good men to the management of affairs.</p>
                        <p>As to the ability of the leading men in the state, I need only to allude
                            to what has been said of late by such men as Cushing, Bruce, and
                            Burlingame, to refer to the history and literature of China, and to
                            recall the names of Confucius and Meng-Tse, Gengis-Khan and Keeblai,
                            Kung-hi and Kien Lung. Of a state thus constituted, it is premature to
                            declare that she possesses no capacity to assimilate herself to new
                            conditions.</p>
                        <p>But however bad may be the condition of China, however necessary for her
                            own salvation it is that she should move forward in a career of
                            progress, and however little hope there may be that she will move
                            without pressure, that is to say, without the use of threats or force,
                            fulfilling all the conditions of the arguments which are advanced by the
                            merchants ami by Mr. Browne, I assume that neither the United States nor
                            England, nor any other state, will use force or threats.</p>
                        <p>It is our disposition to deal with China as a sister and sovereign
                            empire. We have made treaties of amity and commerce with her. We send to
                            her diplomatic representatives and receive hers. We have come to
                            consider that the rules on which we conduct intercourse with the states
                            of Christendom shall be those which shall guide us in our intercourse
                            with China. We are led up to this conclusion by the simplest reasoning.
                            The states of the west have learned nothing of China since they gained
                            access to the Tartar capital which has been of sufficient significance
                            to shake their sense of duty and their preference in this regard. It is
                            easy to deride the advanced liberalism of the age, and to stigmatize the
                            policy which acknowledges broadly the right of any people to work out
                            its destiny freely and independently, as a deliberate sinking of
                            practical ideas and methods, and there may be great truth in the
                            criticisms. But the fact remains that one of the doctrines of the
                            political faith of the age is that all intervention is harmful and
                            should be avoided. <note n="*" xml:id="d222fn2">
                                <p>It is no part of my purpose to discuss the merits of this
                                    doctrine, but I cannot refrain from quoting here words of
                                    Guizot, in his book, “Meditations on the Essence of the
                                    Christian Religion:”</p>
                                <p>“All attacks upon the liberty of conscience, all employment of
                                    force to extirpate or to impose religious beliefs, are and ever
                                    have been iniquitous and tyrannical. All powers, all parties,
                                    all churches, have held such acts to be not only permissible,
                                    but enjoined by the divine law. All have deemed it not only
                                    their right but their duty to prevent and to punish by law and
                                    human force errors in matters of religion. They may all allege
                                    in excuse the sincerity of their belief in the legitimacy of
                                    this usurpation. The usurpation is not the less enormous and
                                    fatal, and perhaps, indeed, it is of all human usurpations the
                                    one which has inflicted on men the most odious torments and the
                                    grossest errors. It will constitute the glory of our time to
                                    have discarded this pretension; nevertheless it yet exists with
                                    persistency in certain states, in certain laws, in certain
                                    recesses of the human soul and of Christian society, and there
                                    is and ever will be need to watch and to combat it, to render
                                    its banishment unconditional and without appeal. Subdued,
                                    however, it is. Civil freedom in matters of faith and religious
                                    life has become a fundamental principle of civilization and of
                                    law. All powers, all parties, all churches have held such acts
                                    to be not only permissible, but enjoined by the divine law.”</p>
                                <p>In what striking analogy are the assumptions of our merchants
                                    when they claim that it is not only the right but the duty of
                                    Christian states “to insist on steps that will further the cause
                                    of civilization in China.” The merchants, too, are sincere and
                                    earnest in their belief in the legitimacy of the usurpation
                                    proposed. But this is no more perfect defense with them than
                                    with the advocates of the propagation of Christianity by force.
                                    The assumption has long since disappeared as between Christian
                                    states. It ought soon to be discarded in our dealings with those
                                    others.</p></note> We may advise respectfully and discreetly, or
                            we may <pb n="348" xml:id="pg_348" facs="0382"/>warn earnestly, but we
                            must confine ourselves to representation, unless our rights are touched.
                            Nor can I imagine that if this is so, and the use of power is forbidden
                            us by the spirit of the age, we can satisfy ourselves or retain our
                            dignity if we use threats, direct or implied.</p>
                        <p>Indeed, I consider that such pressure as the merchants and Mr. Browne
                            advocate is virtually impossible. A British minister using it would be
                            discountenanced by the executive, or, should the executive by any chance
                            support him, Parliament would not be unlikely to expel the executive.
                            The same result cannot happen in America, but no administration careful
                            to respect the sentiments of the people, as wise administrations ever
                            are, would consent to support a representative pursuing such a
                            course.</p>
                        <p>This feature of the case has received apparently no consideration in
                            China. Men there have seemed to devote themselves to the elucidation of
                            the problem: What policy on the part of western states would most
                            surely, rapidly, and safely build up the prosperity of the empire? They
                            have forgotten the essential requirements of any policy, viz., that it
                            shall conform to the spirit of the age and the requirements and
                            limitations of representative government.</p>
                        <p>The question seems a broad one, until we reach this point. It narrows at
                            once here. The western statesman will do all that he can touching China
                            when he sets before her rulers, discreetly and with tact, the arguments
                            which are so ready to his hands in favor of material progress and of
                            liberal institutions, and points out the dangers which will be incurred
                            by the government in holding rigidly to old ideas and practices, while
                            the people are being educated by contact with foreigners to more liberal
                            and advanced views.</p>
                        <p>I have so far kept in view the ideas of the merchants as to progress in
                            China; shown what those ideas are; indicated that they are, or may not
                            be, altogether in accordance with the facts; and that, whether so or
                            not, they are not likely to receive support.</p>
                        <p>My treatment of the matter which remains to be considered will not be
                            different, and my conclusions will not be less positive, although in
                            this, as in the question of progress, I shall endeavor to do as full
                            justice to the arguments advanced on the mercantile side as I can,
                            having reasonable regard to brevity.</p>
                        <p>The policy of dealing with the central government is the one supported by
                            those who believe that, having treaties with the government of China,
                            executed on a basis of equality, and having representatives at the
                            capital, and having ourselves received her representatives, we are bound
                            to discuss and settle disputes which cannot be disposed of by consular
                            negotiations only at the capital, and in conference with the imperial
                            authorities. That such is the desirable course, I presume no one will be
                            found hardy enough to deny. The divergence arises on the question
                            whether the policy is a practicable one.</p>
                        <p>The British memorialists say, “Lord Clarendon has laid down rules <pb
                                n="349" xml:id="pg_349" facs="0383"/>of action for our minister, our
                            consuls, and our community, which would prove utterly inadequate if any
                            crisis occurred demanding extraordinary measures,” and “we cannot but
                            admire the unanswerable vindication by Sir Rutherford Alcock of his and
                            our views, which is contained in Ms dispatch to Lord Clarendon of the
                            5th February last.”</p>
                        <p>Sir Rutherford, then, may be considered the speaker for the merchants as
                            well as for himself. Before quoting, however, from his dispatch of
                            February, referred to, I will briefly state the circumstances which
                            called it forth.</p>
                        <p>On the 22d and 23d of August, 1868, a British missionary named Taylor,
                            and a number of others, men and women, also missionaries, who had
                            settled at Yang-tchoo, near Chin-kiang, were attacked by a mob, who had
                            for several days threatened them. The houses in which they lived were
                            somewhat damaged, and some injuries, fortunately none of a grave
                            character, were inflicted on members of the mission. The animus of the
                            mob will be seen when I state that a house, in the upper rooms of which
                            some ladies of the party had taken refuge, was set fire to and they were
                            forced to jump from the windows to save themselves from the danger of
                            death by burning. The missionaries had been but a few weeks in the city.
                            It would appear that they had conducted themselves with discretion, and
                            when the indications of danger became manifest they were careful to
                            inform the authorities and to request protection.</p>
                        <p>On hearing of the difficulty, Mr. Medhurst, British consul at Shanghai,
                            within whose district Yang-tchoo lies, an officer of deservedly high
                            reputation and of the longest experience, proceeded to the spot and made
                            efforts to secure the punishment of the offenders, and reparation for
                            the damages done and injuries inflicted. He was unsuccessful, and
                            reported the case to his superior at Pekin. Sir R. Alcock, with his
                            accustomed vigor and rapidity, laid the matter before the Foreign
                            Office: with what success may be seen from his own statement, as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>The result has been so far satisfactory that it has been determined to
                            institute a searching and honest inquiry, on the spot, into all the
                            circumstances, and I am assured the punishment of those responsible for
                            any wrong done shall surely follow, together with compensation to the
                            missionaries and their restoration to the places from which they have
                            been ejected.</p>
                        <p>Sir Rutherford, for reasons which he afterward states, did not credit the
                            professions of the Foreign Office, and, instead of waiting to learn what
                            the result would be, he called upon Admiral Keppel “to give such
                            effective support to Mr. Consul Medhurst in the demands he will be
                            instructed to make, as may, I think, avert the necessity for any more
                            active measures of coercion. Should this hope unfortunately not be
                            realized, I am satisfied there is no alternative consistent with a due
                            regard for British interests in China but to direct the consul to place
                            the matter in your hands, in order that you may take such further
                            measures as shall be found necessary to compel the local authorities to
                            meet our demands and do full justice in accordance with the instructions
                            I am assured they will receive from the central government.”</p>
                        <p>In accordance with his instructions, Mr. Medhurst, in due season,
                            proceeded to Nankin, the residence of the viceroy of the district, with
                            the men-of-war Rodney, Rinaldo, Slaney, Bebra, Dove, and Icarus. The
                            first act of this fleet was to inform the commander of a Chinese
                            corvette, the Tien-chi, found at anchor near Nankin, that “he must not
                            weigh without permission, on pain of having a prize crew placed in
                            charge.” This was followed by a demand for the temporary transfer of the
                            Tien-chi. Mr. Medhurst adds: “I need scarcely say that the required
                            order was granted without delay,” although he tells us that the Chinese
                            opposed the demand with “much vehemence.”</p>

                        <p>Having completed some preliminary negotiations with the viceroy, the
                            fleet dropped down the river to Chin-kiang, near Yang-tchoo, and from
                            there two of the smaller vessels, with three hundred marines, proceeded
                            up the Grand Canal to the city of Yang-tchoo itself. The marines were
                            landed there and quartered in the city. The negotiations went forward,
                            the demands were all substantially complied with, and Mr. Medhurst and
                            the flotilla returned to Shanghai with <hi rend="italic">éclat.</hi></p>
                        <p>The British government, however, conceived that the course taken was
                            unsatisfactory, and thus instructed their envoy:</p>
                        <p>Mr. Medhurst very properly reported to you from the first what had
                            happened to the missionaries, and the course which he proposed to
                            pursue; and afterward, when he failed in overcoming the reluctance of
                            the viceroy to afford redress, he, as in duty hound, placed the matter
                            in your hands.</p>
                        <p>You, on your part, very properly called upon the central government to
                            afford redress, and her Majesty’s government are glad to recognize in
                            Prince Kung’s letters, and your own comments on them, the fullest
                            admission on the part of the central government of their responsibility,
                            and the readiness with which they took measures that proved effectual
                            for bringing the local authorities, as well as the viceroy of Nankin, to
                            a proper sense of their respective duties, the result being that full
                            satisfaction was made for the outrage complained of.</p>
                        <p>Thus far the matters followed their proper course. The central government
                            was appealed to for redress against the provincial government, and
                            proved its willingness and ability to obtain it.</p>
                        <p>But I will not conceal from you that her Majesty’s government would have
                            much preferred that the matter should have been left to the action of
                            the central government, subject, of course, to the view which her
                            Majesty’s government might take of it, if that action were withheld or
                            proved unavailing, than that the aid of her Majesty’s naval forces
                            should have been invoked in order to bring pressure or to inflict
                            punishment on the provincial authorities irrespective of the demand
                            which you had made on the central government for redress.</p>
                        <p>And afterward sums up as follows:</p>
                        <p>* * * * The active interference of her Majesty’s naval forces should only
                            be had recourse to in cases of sudden emergency and of immediate danger
                            to lives and property; but when once the matter is removed for
                            diplomatic discussion at Pekin, her Majesty’s government should be left
                            free to determine, if occasion should arise for doing so, what is best
                            to be done to enforce upon the central government the obligations not
                            only to observe treaties, but to compel the provincial authorities also
                            to observe them.</p>
                        <p>This brings me to Sir Rutherford’s “unanswerable vindication” of his
                            action, and of his views and those of the merchants. Sir Rutherford
                            says:</p>
                        <p>Some shorter and less disastrous mode of settling wrongs and disputes at
                            distant ports is as much to be desired in the interest of the Chinese
                            nation and government as in that of foreigners, even though it should be
                            less strictly accordant with international law and usage. Against the
                            disadvantages that attach to local actions, even after appeal shall have
                            been made in vain to the government at Pekin, and the objections in
                            principle to which all such extreme courses must be open, both Chinese
                            and foreign powers may wisely, perhaps, set as a counterbalance the
                            avoidance of cumulative wrong leading to the necessity of a war, and
                            entailing costly expenditure on the one side and a perilous loss of
                            authority and prestige on the other.</p>
                        <p>We need not look to Vattel or Grotius for any sanction to such
                            exceptional action, for the simple reason that they and all other
                            writers on international law deal with principles in their application
                            to civilized states, recognizing a mutual obligation, and governed by
                            similar, or at least analogous, systems of jurisprudence and polity; but
                            when dealing with oriental races and states, ignorant of all the
                            conditions and principles of European polity, a special adaptation of
                            those principles is required to meet the wholly exceptional character of
                            the situation caused by a forced intercourse between races holding
                            totally different views of moral obligation and national policy. The
                            broad principles of justice, of right and wrong, which underlie the
                            international code of nations, must be respected everywhere by civilized
                            states, but an over-scrupulous pedantry in adherence to the rules
                            deduced from these, and forming the system known in Europe as the law of
                            nations, in dealing with an Asiatic race like the Chinese, is only
                            calculated to do mischief, and bring on the very evils it is intended to
                            avert.</p>
                        <p>Some special modification of rules and principles of international law,
                            as this is understood and recognized by European states, is required in
                            the interest of peace and justice. Local authorities must not be
                            allowed, by persistent misrule and violation of <pb n="351"
                                xml:id="pg_351" facs="0385"/>treaties, to bring on their country the
                            horrors of war as the sole means of redressing the wrong, and the only
                            effective means of preventing this, in default of a central government,
                            with adequate power, is to make them feel a personal responsibility for
                            their acts such as their own government ought, but, under present
                            conditions, seems quite unable to enforce. The knowledge that, sooner or
                            later, if justice is denied and instructions from Pekin disregarded, to
                            the injury of foreigners, they will have themselves to deal with a
                            foreign power they can neither defy nor resist, will soon lead to a
                            radical reform in the course of action, and teach them to respect treaty
                            obligations for their own sake if they care nothing either for treaties
                            or the orders of their own government. Such a policy, if carried out
                            with judgment and moderation by the treaty powers, will act beneficially
                            at both ends of the line. The Pekin government will be disposed to take
                            more stringent measures than they otherwise would with their provincial
                            officers to enforce respect for the rights and interests of foreigners,
                            while the officials themselves will become more circumspect not to
                            provoke the inevitable issue of conflict with a foreign power, and all
                            parties will gain largely thereby.</p>
                        <p>Hitherto the course of affairs has been only too truly described by the
                            memorialists from the ports.</p>
                        <p>When any wrong or injustice is suffered by a foreigner for which there is
                            no appeal to a public court of justice and a written code of laws, if
                            the Chinese local authorities are not moved, as is too often the case,
                            by the consul’s representations, the only recourse is a reference to the
                            minister at Pekin; and then commences an interminable series of
                            references backward and forward—a see-saw of correspondence on both
                            sides between the ports and the capital—and no final solution is ever
                            arrived at. It may be safely affirmed that such is the experience of all
                            the foreign representatives. I am assured there is no one of these who
                            cannot point to numerous cases which have been so treated for a number
                            of years, despite their best efforts to secure a better result.</p>
                        <p>Such experience leads infallibly to a conviction that when treaties have
                            been imposed by force upon an unwilling government, as all with China
                            have been, they can only be upheld by the same means. The diplomatic
                            instrument has no binding power with Chinese rulers when its
                            stipulations can be evaded with impunity, or whenever it is believed
                            that the force that imposed them is no longer extant or available.
                            Diplomacy in such circumstances means armed reason. As Carlyle, in his
                            quaint style, remarks, “Diplomacy is clouds, beating your enemies on sea
                            and land,” and the only evidence of power or title to respect, a true
                            oriental freely recognizes. And in order that foreign powers may not
                            have to resort to such rude instruments for proving their title, it
                            behooves them to find means of preventing cumulative violations of
                            treaty, since continued impunity brings with it a conviction of
                            weakness; for, as I have said on a former occasion, it is weakness, or
                            the suspicion of it, which invaribly provokes aggression, and with
                            eastern races is a far more fruitful cause of had faith and danger than
                            either force or the abuse of it. The desire to avoid complications and
                            wars in the far east should suggest, not an unreasoning recoil from the
                            assertion of treaty rights from fear of the troubles it may bring, but a
                            steadfast adherence to such conditions of intercourse as experience has
                            proved to be best adapted to insure respect for engagements.</p>
                        <p>Sir Rutherford then states his belief—</p>
                        <p>That well-combined measures of pressure, showing, by unmistakable signs,
                            both the will and the immediate power to enforce, if needs be, demands
                            for redress, persistently denied after reference to Pekin, and promises
                            of action from the government, will never fail if brought to hear
                            judiciously against the local authorities, however high their
                            position.</p>
                        <p>But in order that this pressure may be irresistible, Sir Rutherford
                            condemns unauthorized action, that is to say, the independent action of
                            consuls and commanders of vessels of war, and insists that the power to
                            exercise pressure should be given only to the diplomatic representative
                            of the government. “Thus guarded,” he says, “there is little to fear
                            from any abuse of power, and much to hope from its discretionary
                            exercise being intrusted to the representative at Pekin, should
                            necessity arise.”</p>
                        <p>During the time that the Yang-tchoo matter was going forward I could not
                            but feel that a mistaken policy was being carried out, and I took the
                            liberty, which perhaps was justified by my long experience in China, to
                            express my views to Mr. Browne; the substance of my argument was that
                            our relations with China are of such character as to bind us to appeal
                            for the settlement of difficulties to the government at Pekin; that
                            there was no good reason to doubt the ability of the government <pb
                                n="352" xml:id="pg_352" facs="0386"/>to give redress in that and all
                            similar cases; that the policy of appealing to the government did indeed
                            stand discredited, many appeals for justice having been unsuccessful,
                            but that it was perhaps true that the appeals had been faint or
                            otherwise not forcible. I then recited the circumstances of the empire
                            when the foreign minister went to the capital and for several years
                            thereafter, pointed out the straits and difficulties into which the
                            administration was placed by reason of the rebellions existing in
                            various districts, and the novel character of its relations with western
                            states, and showed how the whole situation had called for a policy of
                            generous forbearance and support from the ministers. I urged that this
                            forbearance had, perhaps, in the best spirit, but unfortunately been
                            carried so far as to engender a feeling of irresponsibility on the part
                            of the government, and of irritation on the part of the merchants, who,
                            finding their grievances always unredressed, came to believe that
                            justice could not be procured from the government. I showed also that
                            the ministers, more acutely alive to the difficulties of China, came to
                            look with annoyance on the exacting character of the views of their
                            compatriots at the ports, and to set them down, as Mr. Burlingame since
                            has, as opium dealers and smugglers, with whom self-interest was
                            everything. I urged that at length the time had come when a more
                            strenuous tone should be adopted toward China; a time when justice
                            should be exacted as well as given.</p>
                        <p>The central feature of Sir Rutherford’s argument is, that there is no
                            sufficient centralization in China. My argument on this head was the one
                            which would naturally be based on the peculiar constitution of the
                            Chinese government, as explained in an earlier part of this dispatch. I
                            pointed out that to the viceroys is left the control of their respective
                            districts, and that these are appointed and removed from the capital. I
                            urged that this power of appointment and removal was perfectly
                            exercised, and that while there were doubtless many ways in which the
                            government could effect the settlement of disputes, this power of
                            removal was of itself sufficient.</p>
                        <p>I note in Sir Rutherford’s letter a more or less perfect admission of my
                            statement that the policy which the ministers had pursued at Pekin was
                            not a strenuous one. He says:</p>
                        <p>It is in truth clear that the central government must find means to
                            compel a greater respect for their own orders on the part of their local
                            authorities throughout the provinces wherever foreigners are found, or
                            foreign powers will be driven to one of two alternatives in
                            self-defense; they must either devise such local means of pressure as
                            shall control and coerce malfeasant and corrupt officials into good
                            behaviour, or hold the imperial government responsible for unredressed
                            wrongs at the ports and elsewhere in a much more direct and stringent
                            manner than has yet been the practice as a general rule.</p>
                        <p>He adds:</p>
                        <p>The last alternative is no doubt more consonant with treaty relations and
                            international law than the first.</p>
                        <p>In these sentences Sir Rutherford admits enough to condemn his theory. We
                            are clearly bound to give the regular proceeding at least a trial.
                            According to his statement it has not been the practice as a general
                            rule to push that procedure to its extreme point. My own opinion is,
                            that that procedure has very seldom been pushed to its extreme, and that
                            the Chinese government, weak as it is, with everything to lose and
                            nothing to gain by a foreign war, will never fail to find a way to do
                            justice when the demand is made with the statement, “Do this or we shall
                            find a way to right ourselves.”</p>
                        <p>The centralization policy will, however, be adhered to until it is proved
                            utterly inadequate. When this can no longer be a matter of doubt,
                            foreign <pb n="353" xml:id="pg_353" facs="0387"/>states will begin to
                            discuss the policy which can be pursued in China, and not till then.
                            Meanwhile all arguments such as this of Sir Rutherford, that the war
                            power of Great Britain should be placed in his hands, will avail little.
                            It is, indeed, difficult for me to conceive that any one can believe
                            that Great Britain or America would consent deliberately to grant such
                            powers to their envoys, not in respect of certain definite issues, but
                            in respect of any and all matters wherein those envoys should consider
                            the use of force desirable. I doubt whether the constitution of either
                            state would admit of the bestowal of such authority. As a citizen of a
                            state which is interested in China, not so much for the value of
                            existing trade as for the possibilities of her future, a state which has
                            no unreasonable ambition in the east, but is intent on preserving there
                            a free field for the enterprise of her citizens, I should hope that no
                            such authority would be granted to any envoy. If it should be the desire
                            of China to stir up hostile feeling against foreigners, how could it be
                            more perfectly effected than by encouraging a disposition on their part
                            to wage petty wars in various parts of the empire. If it should be the
                            wish of any state to effect a conquest, how easy to bring about a
                            general war with China by such fashion of procedure, or to find an
                            excuse for holding this or that district as a “material guarantee” for
                            the fulfillment of treaties.</p>
                        <p>But although I support the centralization policy, I trust that I
                            recognize its difficulties and dangers. I see clearly that while the
                            subordination of viceroys and other provincial officers is theoretically
                            perfect, they are still greatly independent—the very fact that broad
                            powers are committed to them renders it desirable for the government to
                            treat them with consideration. It is seldom that an officer is degraded
                            unless for cause. If he is an able and ambitious civilian he is sent to
                            a disorderly district, and if there he brings about a better state of
                            things it is well, but if he fails he pays the penalty. If he is an able
                            and ambitious general he is perhaps given civil duties, or he is sent to
                            quell a distant insurrection. If he succeeds the advantage rests with
                            the state, and if he fails it is easy for the government to rid itself
                            of him. When all other courses fail the man of too great prominence is
                            brought to the capital itself and given promotion to one or the other of
                            the great boards of the state, where he has no direct power and is
                            hampered by his associates.</p>
                        <p>While the leading provincial officer has a degree of independence, he has
                            also an advantage in the fact that no representation can readily reach
                            the capital from his district unless it passes through his hands. There
                            are no newspapers. The subordinate officers can only send their
                            addresses to the throne through him. He can, therefore, suppress, alter,
                            or add to the facts of a case and make upon them any special plea which
                            suits him.</p>
                        <p>To this time a large majority of the leading men of China are hostile to
                            foreigners. The provincial authorities know this, and perhaps feel that
                            their careers depend somewhat on their success in outwitting or
                            circumventing the foreigner. The man too favorable to them is likely to
                            have it brought up as a charge against him at the capital. It is
                            manifest that so long as this spirit pervades the official classes in
                            China, the evasion with which foreign officers seeking to enforce
                            justice for their people will be met, will be constant and
                            disheartening. Those at the capital will often promise redress, trusting
                            to the ability of those in the provinces to misinterpret instructions,
                            or to introduce vexatious delays. Those in the provinces will make
                            references to the capital, knowing that they will receive back vague and
                            uncertain directions, capable of being <pb n="354" xml:id="pg_354"
                                facs="0388"/>twisted to suit their purposes, or at least to justify
                            procrastination. The celebrated saying of Philip II of Spain: “Time and
                            I are two,” may be considered as ever in the minds of Chinese statesmen.
                            Time is nothing with them, or rather time is everything. I have known
                            Chinese officers to make promises, for no purpose, apparently, but to
                            gain time to manufacture excuses. The lessons to be learned are
                            obvious.</p>
                        <p>When there is a dispute brought before a consul by one of his
                            compatriots, he must spare no pains to make a complete investigation of
                            the matter. If possible, he should get a Chinese officer to make with
                            him a joint investigation and record. Failing to procure justice he
                            should refer the case and all the evidence to the capital. The minister
                            will then be in a position to speak positively to the government, and if
                            he has occasion to refer home for instructions, his government will be
                            able to form an opinion as to the merits of the case and to give
                            instructions. And lastly, the home government must not hesitate to
                            authorize demands when there is reasonable occasion therefor. As I have
                            said, such demands, with the alternative of the use of force, will not
                            fail to procure redress of grievances.</p>
                        <p>There is likely to arise a class of cases where to delay is to yield up
                            property and life, perhaps, to wanton destruction. I have not yet
                            considered these.</p>
                        <p>One can imagine the individual citizen guiding his life with the most
                            perfect control and moderation. Such moderation, even in well-ordered
                            countries, does not always insure safety. There is no guilt imputed to
                            the man who in self-defense strikes back vigorously. The person who
                            assaults is to be condemned abstractly, but when an emergency arises he
                            may do so without infringing law or right.</p>
                        <p>Much more is it true that in eastern countries, where prejudices of race
                            and religion exist, the most perfect moderation on the part of
                            foreigners will not secure safety, and that it may be necessary in the
                            interests of humanity to deliver sharp blows. Blood is thicker than
                            water. It is not to be expected that the foreigner or his civil or
                            military representative will stand still in such cases.</p>
                        <p>I presume there is no government unwilling to recognize the necessities
                            which so arise. They will put their recognition of it as little on paper
                            as possible. They will ever impress the necessity of careful procedure.
                            They will indicate that force may only be used at the peril of the
                            official. They will scrutinize closely the use of it. But they will
                            defend the officer who, in moderation and discretion, and with
                            recognition of his responsibility, has acted with vigor. The
                            representative who cannot so act, when it may be necessary, would indeed
                            be unfit for his post. If I do not dwell further on this proposition the
                            reason is manifest. When discretionary powers are granted, the fact
                            implies the difficulty of making rules.</p>
                        <p>This dispatch has already exceeded reasonable bounds, and I here leave
                            the subject dealt with in your hands. In doing so I feel conscious that
                            many considerations remain untouched. What I have said, however, will
                            indicate my conception of our true policy in China. Circumstances and
                            fuller information must modify whatever policy is adopted.</p>
                        <p>And lest I may leave wrong impressions, I shall add that while I have
                            spoken as if there is but one mind among our merchants in the east,
                            practically there are many and divergent views held. The address to Mr.
                            Browne cannot be considered conclusive on this head, though, as
                            evidence, they may seem unimpeachable.</p>
                        <p>Sir R. Alcock and Mr. Browne, I may say, differ between themselves, and
                            each more or less from the merchants. They are, however, equally <pb
                                n="355" xml:id="pg_355" facs="0389"/>earnest in their advocacy of
                            truth and of the interests of China, as they see them.</p>
                        <p>Of some of the expressions of Mr. Burlingame I have spoken without
                            reserve. My advocacy of the principles which formed the basis of his
                            policy is the best testimony I can bear to my high estimate of his
                            disposition and services.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: It becomes my painful duty to inform you
                            that on the 21st instant a terrible riot occurred at Tien-tsin, which
                            resulted in the death of sixteen French subjects, three Russians, and
                            the destruction of the French consulate, Roman Catholic cathedral, and
                            the establishment of the Sisters of Charity. In addition to the
                            foreigners killed, several native Christians, as well as the servants
                            employed in and about the mission establishment and consulate, were put
                            to death. The exact number of these unfortunate Chinese it is, as yet,
                            impossible to ascertain. This tragedy was enacted on the afternoon of
                            the 21st instant, news of which reached Pekin on the evening of the 22d.
                            The scene of the riot was in the Chinese city, some two miles distant
                            from the “Concession,” where most of the foreigners reside.
                            Notwithstanding this, the excitement and alarm among all foreigners
                            living on the “Concession” at Tien-tsin have been great, fearing an
                            attack upon the foreign settlement, without regard to nationality. As no
                            foreigner has, as yet, dared to venture into the Chinese city, where the
                            outrages were committed, our information in regard to the origin of this
                            sad affair is meager, and much of it contradictory. Most of the
                            information comes through Chinese channels, and it is necessary to hear
                            all sides in order to come to any reasonable conclusion as to the truth
                            of the matter. Even now I am only able to give you my <hi rend="italic"
                                >opinion</hi> as to the <hi rend="italic">facts,</hi> which may be
                            modified or changed entirely by future evidence.</p>
                        <p>In order that you may be able to see and understand the whole case
                            clearly, it is important that you should have before you the history of
                            these Catholic establishments and their management in China, which
                            appear to have been the sole cause of the riot.</p>
                        <p>At many of the principal places in China open to foreign residence the
                            Sisters of Charity have established institutions, each of which appears
                            to combine in itself a foundling hospital and orphan asylum. Finding
                            that the Chinese were averse to placing children in their charge, the
                            managers of these institutions offered a certain sum per head for all
                            the children placed under their control given to them, it being
                            understood that a child once in their asylum no parent, relative, or
                            guardian could claim or exercise any control over it. It has been for
                            some time asserted by the Chinese, and believed by most of the
                            non-Catholie foreign population residing here, that the system of paying
                            bounties induced the kidnapping of children for these institutions for
                            the sake of the reward. It is also asserted, and I believe it to be
                            true, that the priests or Sisters, or both, have been in the habit of
                            holding out inducements to have children brought to them in the last
                            stages of <pb n="356" xml:id="pg_356" facs="0390"/>illness, for the
                            purpose of being baptized <hi rend="italic">in articulo mortis.</hi> In
                            this way many children have been taken to these establishments in the
                            last stages of disease, baptized there, and soon after taken away dead.
                            All these acts, together with the secrecy and seclusion which appear to
                            be a part and parcel of the regulations which govern institutions of
                            this character everywhere, have created suspicions in the minds of the
                            Chinese, and these suspicions have engendered an intense hatred against
                            the Sisters on the part of all the common people who live any where near
                            a mission; and any rumor concerning the Sisters or their acts, however
                            improbable and absurd, found thousands of willing and honest believers
                            among the ignorant and superstitious people. Some time about the end of
                            May or beginning of June an epidemic prevailed at the Sisters’
                            institution at Tien-tsin, and a considerable number of the children
                            died. In some way the report got abroad that the Sisters were killing
                            the children to get their eyes and hearts for the purpose of
                            manufacturing some sort of a medical specific, much sought after in
                            Europe, and commanding a fabulous price. This report spread from one to
                            another, and soon the belief became general among the common people, not
                            only in Tien-tsin, but for many miles around. I heard of the excitement
                            as early as the 5th of June. Crowds of people assembled from time to
                            time near the mission buildings, indulged in excited and angry
                            conversation, and on more than one occasion demanded of the Sisters that
                            the children should be liberated. It is said that one day the crowd
                            became so noisy and violent that the Sisters, fearing violence from the
                            mob, consented that an examination should be made by a committee of
                            five. The consul, hearing of the disturbance, made his appearance about
                            this time, and, although the committee had been selected and were then
                            in the building, he stopped the whole proceeding and drove the committee
                            from the building with angry words; and some say he used his cane in
                            expelling them. Subsequently the district magistrate took a man who had
                            been industriously spreading the reports, who said he could point out
                            the persons that were guilty of acts of sorcery and other crimes, to
                            question him in the presence of the Sisters, and when confronted by them
                            admitted that all his stories were without foundation and false. This
                            appeared to quiet matters for a few days, but the excitement soon
                            revived again, apparently more intense than before, the populace now
                            demanding the release of the children as a <hi rend="italic">sine qua
                                non.</hi> The day prior to the outbreak the district magistrate, who
                            is about on a par, in point of rank and authority, with the mayor of one
                            of our cities, called upon the French consul and stated that unless
                            permission be given for a thorough examination of the Sisters’
                            establishment, it was difficult to foretell the result. The consul,
                            construing this language into a threat, replied that, the magistrate
                            being inferior in rank to the consul, no negotiation could take place
                            between them for the purpose indicated, or any other. On the afternoon
                            of the 21st the mob assembled in front of the consulate, making a great
                            noise and throwing stones and other missiles at the building. Seeing the
                            impracticability of dispersing the mob unaided, the consul started for
                            the yam un (office) of Chang-how, the highest officer living in
                            Tien-tsin, for the purpose of asking assistance to quell the riotous
                            proceedings. Notwithstanding Chang how’s statement, that the consul
                            fired a pistol at him in his yamun, I don’t believe it. The consul
                            undoubtedly reached the yamun of Chang how in a state of excitement
                            bordering upon insanity, told his business, and started out again,
                            accompanied by some mandarins. When he reached the street he met the
                            mob, noisy and turbulent, and in the excitement he, I doubt not, shot
                            two or three shots from his revolver at the crowd. <pb n="357"
                                xml:id="pg_357" facs="0391"/>This appears to have been the signal
                            for the bloody work of the mob. The consul and his clerk were
                            immediately killed; and as all accounts agree substantially with the
                            report of Air. Meadows,-as to. the subsequent action of the mob, I beg
                            to refer you to Mr. Meadows’s letters, which accompany this dispatch. As
                            an evidence of the widespread knowledge of what was going on at
                            Tien-tsin, and the evident determination of the people generally that no
                            information should reach Pekin until their fancied wrongs had been
                            avenged, I would refer to the fact that the courier that was intrusted
                            with Mr. Meadows’s letter was intercepted some distance this side of
                            Tien-tsin, seized, beaten terribly, and carried back to Tien-tsin <hi
                                rend="italic">vi et armis.</hi> Several couriers dispatched to the
                            other legations received similar treatment; so that for two or three
                            days the foreign residents of Pekin were considerably excited, fearing
                            that the contagion might spread to this city. The news, being known
                            among the natives here quite as soon as it was by legations, caused
                            considerable commotion for a while. The native workmen engaged in the
                            erection of a building for the Sisters in this city quit their work, and
                            the servants at the Catholic establishments and some at the French
                            legation took “French leave.”</p>
                        <p>The reported atrocities connected with the assassination of the Sisters
                            seem too horrible and fiendish for belief. If true, it goes to show to
                            what a pitch of frenzy the ignorant and superstitious Lan be wrought by
                            rumors too absurd for belief by any educated and Christian people. The
                            report now is that these poor creatures were taken out of the building;
                            put to death by means of spears, knives, and swords; their eyes and
                            hearts taken out; and their bodies thrown into the flames of the burning
                            buildings. The fury of the mob seems to have been directed toward the
                            teachers of the Catholic religion, in which the Chinese appear to have
                            included <hi rend="italic">all Frenchmen.</hi> This opinion must have
                            originated in the fact that all the Roman Catholic missions in China are
                            under the care and special protection of the French minister at Pekin,
                            and the French consuls at the several open ports. In addition, all or
                            nearly all French subjects residing in China are Catholics in faith, and
                            worship at the various Catholic churches scattered through the empire.
                            It is supposed that the killing of the three Russians was done by
                            mistake, the mob supposing them to be Frenchmen. The truth of this
                            theory appears to be established by the fact that there were a few
                            English, Germans, and Swiss living in the city, not far from the scene
                            of the riot, who were not harmed or molested, and by the additional fact
                            that the Protestant chapels in the city were not injured beyond the
                            carrying off of the movable furniture, books, &amp;c. I hope, and am
                            inclined to believe, that the fury of the mob is spent, and that all
                            real danger to the foreign residents on the “Concession” is over,
                            although the history of mobs, the world over, goes to prove this fact:
                            that the motive which incites riots is, during their progress, often
                            lost sight of, and their subsequent acts are controlled by persons who
                            join them for purposes of robbery and plunder alone. It is only in this
                            view of the case that there is danger in the future; and I shall not
                            feel sure of quiet and order until a gunboat arrives at Tien-tsin. The
                            British gunboat Opossum is said to be at Chefoo. If so, she will be
                            likely to make her appearance at Tien-tsin in two or three days at
                            furthest. I have no idea where any of the United States fleet are; but
                            it is fair to presume they are all on the coast of Japan, where the
                            climate is more agreeable than on the Chinese coast in summer.</p>

                        <p>When the news of the massacre—for it can be called by no other
                            name—reached Pekin, a meeting was called of all the representatives <pb
                                n="358" xml:id="pg_358" facs="0392"/>of the treaty powers residing
                            here, to consult upon the measures necessary to adopt for the mutual
                            protection of our countrymen. Although the information we had received
                            was meager, disjointed, and much of it evidently unreliable, it was
                            thought best, without waiting for details, to address a joint note to
                            the government here, as being the best step to awaken the chief
                            officials to a due sense of their responsibility, and induce them to
                            adopt measures promptly to restore order and quiet; for prompt action on
                            their part seemed necessary, not only for the safety of foreign
                            residents in Tien-tsin, but in Pekin also. A copy of this note
                            accompanies this. It is but just to say that the government here shows
                            every disposition to do all in its power, but it is weak and effeminate,
                            and requires the constant advice and aid of the foreign representatives
                            to point out the proper steps to take. I inclose a copy of the note from
                            Prince Kung, received on the 25th instant, stating what had been done
                            toward quieting things at Tien-tsin. In addition to this, all the
                            available troops in this vicinity have been brought into the ci% and
                            posted in the neighborhood of the Catholic establishments for their
                            protion. I also send herewith translations of all the decrees that have
                            appeared up to. this date. In the foregoing I have endeavored to give
                            you the substance of the best information that has reached me up to this
                            day. Until further intelligence is received I forbear criticising the
                            causes which led to this terrible affair, or speculating upon the
                            probable or possible effects of it, upon the future intercourse of China
                            with the western nations. Enough, however, is known to establish clearly
                            three facts:</p>
                        <p>1st. That the action of the Sisters of Charity, or of those who
                            controlled their institution, in the purchase of children, was the cause
                            of the rumors which incited the mob.</p>
                        <p>2d. That the action of the mob was not directed against foreigners
                            because <hi rend="italic">they were foreigners.</hi> It appears, rather,
                            to have been a religious crusade against Catholics; not particularly for
                            the reason that Catholics were teaching the Christian religion, but
                            because of their action in filling the asylums with children against the
                            washes of the Chinese, and in a manner calculated to arouse prejudices
                            and engender hatred. All French subjects were included in the category
                            of those who committed these crimes, because the French government
                            appeared to be the guardian and protector of the Catholic missions.</p>
                        <p>3d. That the action of the French consul was unwise, in not giving his
                            consent for the use of any reasonable means to disabuse the minds of the
                            people and allay the excitement; and also in firing his pistol into the
                            crowd of people, which precipitated a bloody collision between natives
                            and foreigners, thereby sacrificing his own life and the lives of others
                            who had placed themselves under his protection.</p>
                        <p>I think I hazard nothing in saying that the representations of Great
                            Britain, Russia, and North Germany agree with me in these opinions.</p>
                        <p>In thus expressing my opinions as to the causes of the riot, I do not
                            desire to be understood as excusing or palliating this terrible crime,
                            or the action of the officials; who, by their inertness, if not by
                            direct complicity in the plot, failed to take any resolute action to
                            quell the disturbance and protect the lives and property of those who
                            were residing upon Chinese soil, in pursuance of treaty rights, and
                            engaged in lawful undertakings, in accordance with the strict letter of
                            treaty stipulations.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> It is with the deepest grief and
                                indignation that the undersigned, who represent the foreign
                                governments accredited to China, have learned the news of the
                                atrocious crime which has been committed at Tien-tsin. as it were at
                                one of the gates of the capital of the empire. The consul of France,
                                the missionaries, and Sisters of Charity and other Frenchmen
                                residing at Tien-tsin, have been massacred and their establishments
                                burned. From the particulars which have yet reached Pekin, not very
                                exact, it is true, there is reason to fear that the fanatical
                                populace will not refrain from further excesses toward the foreign
                                residents at Tien-tsin.</p>
                            <p>The undersigned do not doubt that the government of his Majesty the
                                Emperor of China in its wisdom sympathizes in the general
                                indignation felt in consequence of these atrocities, and is fully
                                sensible of the grave responsibility which rests upon it, as well as
                                its duty to take the necessary measures to prevent the repetition of
                                such acts<hi rend="italic">;</hi> which, wherever they may occur,
                                cannot fail to seriously compromise the position of the imperial
                                government in the eyes of all the world.</p>
                            <p>The occurrences at Tien-tsin prove, in fact, that foreigners are not
                                everywhere sufficiently protected by these Chinese, local
                                authorities. It is therefore for the interest of the imperial
                                government itself to demonstrate, by the clearest acts, its firm
                                intention to assure the safety of all foreigners who have trusted
                                themselves to its fidelity, wherever they may be within the confines
                                of the empire. If such a catastrophe as this could happen only
                                eighty miles from the capital, the undersigned cannot but fear that,
                                unless the guilty persons are promptly punished, new attempts will
                                be made at places further from the capital, where the authority of
                                the central power has less efficiency. It is indispensable that, as
                                other countries hear the tidings of this crime, they should at the
                                same time be informed that justice is being done: and thus each of
                                them will be reassured as to the condition of its citizens who have
                                trusted themselves to the protection of China.</p>
                            <p>The undersigned gladly avail themselves of this occasion to renew to
                                his imperial highness the assurance of their respectful
                                consideration.</p>

                            <p>Prince Kung, chief secretary of state for foreign affairs, herewith
                                has the honor to state, in respect to the riot which has occurred at
                                Tien-tsin, that he has already been honored with a decree from the
                                throne, ordering Tsang Kwohfan, governor general of this province,
                                to go there and attend to its suppression.</p>
                            <p>The Foreign Office has also sent a letter to Tsunghow, at Tien-tsin,
                                ordering him to <pb n="360" xml:id="pg_360" facs="0394"/>take
                                measures to arrest the lawless men who had stirred up this <hi
                                    rend="italic">émeute</hi> and execute upon them the severest
                                penalties of the laws, in order to vindicate the justice of
                                government, and restrain all further outbreak. He was also directed
                                to take the utmost precaution in protecting the foreign consulate
                                and residences, so that no further molestation need be
                                apprehended.</p>
                            <p>A dispatch has also been received from him, in which he states that
                                at an early hour on the 22d instant he went to the office of the
                                commissioner of customs, where he met all the foreign consuls, and
                                assured them that there was no cause for further alarm. He had also
                                sent officers to the foreign hongs at the city, who had ascertained
                                that no damage had been done to them, and had taken letters from
                                them down to the foreign settlement at Tszchuhtm, in order to
                                relieve the anxiety of the friends of those living there, He had
                                further detailed officers to go to various points to repress any
                                disturbance and afford all possible protection, which had still
                                further quieted the apprehensions of all classes, as he was assured
                                by the replies already received from the consuls.</p>
                            <p>Haying received these particulars, I have the honor to make them
                                known for your excellency’s information.</p>

                            <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">an imperial decree.</hi></p>
                            <p>Tsunghow has memorialized us respecting a riot among the people at
                                Tien-tsin, and lighting with the religionists, requesting that his
                                guilt [in the affair] may be investigated, and the local officers be
                                severally examined with severity in reference to their degradation.
                                It seems that some children were kidnapped, and some reckless
                                villains implicated the Roman Catholic establishments in the
                                practice, which led the people of Tien-tsin to suspect evil and
                                excite strife; and further, Mr. Fontanier, the French consul, fired
                                his pistol when at the office of Tsunghow, and at the district
                                magistrate of Tien-tsin, which had irritated the crowd to such a
                                degree that they killed Mr. Fontanier and burned the Roman Catholic
                                establishments. Tsunghow is in charge of comercial affairs, and he
                                therefore is not the one to keep the place quiet; but Chow, the
                                intendant, is responsible for taking the lead, and yet adopted no
                                precautionary measures in the matter; nor did the prefect, Chang, or
                                the district magistrate, Lin, at Tien-tsin, either of them act right
                                at all in reference to it, whereby this very serious matter has
                                attained such a pass. Their delinquencies admit of no
                                palliation.</p>
                            <p>Let Tsunghow and all the other officers be handed over to the board
                                that their proper punishment may be decided. Let Tsang Kwoh-fan, as
                                soon as he reaches Tien-tsin, investigate the whole thing most
                                thoroughly, and report in a memorial. Let those lawless people who
                                have kidnapped children, and the leaders in this riot, be all seized
                                and dealt with severely, according to law. And lastly, let him and
                                Tsunghow jointly search into the causes of this whole affair to the
                                very bottom, and manage it equitably, without the least partiality.
                                Respect this.</p>

                                and Chinese Roman Catholics, in consequence, it is said, of the
                                priests and Sisters of Charity, through their employés, having
                                kidnapped numbers of Chinese children for some months back, and when
                                any of them died, caused their eyes and hearts to be extracted for
                                medicinal purposes. An intense hatred has been laterly created
                                through these reports on the part of the people against the French
                                Roman Catholics, and I felt certain there would be an outbreak on
                                the part of the people if the French residents did not take measures
                                to do away with the impression existing among the people. To-day Mr.
                                Fontanier and the assistant of the consulate proceeded armed to the
                                Yamên of his excellency Chunghow, and on their way back to the
                                consulate, accompanied by Chunghow, and when they met the district
                                magistrate, who stopped Chunghow to speak to him, Mr. Fontanier
                                fired on Chunghow and the magistrate three shots from his revolver,
                                beside striking Chunghow slightly with the butt of his pistol on the
                                head. The Chinese people who surrounded them <pb n="361"
                                    xml:id="pg_361" facs="0395"/>rushed oh Mr. Fontanier and the
                                assistant and killed them. The excitement now became intense among
                                the people, who in a large body proceeded to the Tien-ehu-tang,
                                killed the three priests there, two French people <hi rend="italic"
                                    >en route</hi> for Pekin, and all the Roman Catholic Chinese,
                                after which they burned down the building. The crowd now became
                                greater, and the authorities could not control it. The people now
                                proceeded to the Jin-tsz-tang, where the Sisters of Charity resided,
                                killed five sisters and all the Chinese Roman Catholics in the
                                building. Three more Roman Catholics, met in the street, were also
                                killed about this time. This building was also burned down. The
                                whole of the mandarins of the city had now reached the spot, and
                                persuaded the people to disperse. These latter found the bones of
                                children in the Jin-tsz-tang, which roused their fury exceedingly.
                                No injury has been done to the persons or property of the people of
                                other nationalities. The ladies of the American and British
                                Protestant missions went to the British consulate to stay this night
                                with Mrs. Lay, the wife of the British consul.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> At 2 a. m., on the 22d instant, I had
                                the honor to address your excellency regarding serious matters which
                                had occurred here during the 21st instant. My dispatch I handed to
                                Mr. Arendt, vice-consul of the North German Confederation, who was
                                sending a dispatch by special courier to Pekin at that time. This
                                morning I was astonished to receive back my dispatch from Mr.
                                Arendt. It appears, from Mr. Arendt’s note, that the messenger had
                                been unable to proceed on to Pekin. As I am desirous of at once
                                sending you all information up to this moment, I once again address
                                you. My first dispatch, which I inclose, will convey to you the
                                first accounts we received of the terrible events of the day
                                previous. I am now able to correct some of my report, having since
                                received more correct information. After the Jin-tse-tang people
                                were killed, it appears there were nine Sisters of Charity and a
                                number of Chinese. There were over thirty female children found in
                                the place, who were sent to the mandarins. At the Tien-chu-tang
                                there was one foreigner (French) killed and one native priest; also
                                Mr. Tomassen and wife of the French legation, who arrived per Manchu
                                from Shanghai, and a number of Chinese servants. At the French
                                consulate, situated within the Tien-chu-tang premises, there were
                                killed Mr. Fontanier, the consul: Mr. Simon, the vice-consul, and a
                                number of Chinese. Mr. Chalmaison and his wife, store-keepers, were
                                killed in their store near the south gate. They were Roman
                                Catholics. Two Russian-Siberians, and the wife of one of them, were
                                killed as they were coming down in sedans from town, at the time the
                                people were burning the Jin-tsz-tang, being evidently mistaken for
                                French Roman Catholics, as none of the Swiss, German, and English
                                people, all Protestants, were molested, although living separately
                                in town. There appear to have been altogether nineteen foreigners,
                                French and Russians, killed on the 21st instant. The people in the
                                settlement have naturally been in considerable alarm, but the moment
                                I learned, at 5 p. m. on the 21st, that the Chinese people had
                                dispersed after destroying the Tien-chu-tang and Jin-tsz-tang, Roman
                                Catholics, without molesting the Protestant residents in town, I
                                felt sure we would not be disturbed in the “settlement,” and such
                                has been the case up to this moment. At 10 a. m., on the 22d
                                instant, Chunghow met all the consuls at the residence of the
                                commissioner of customs. He detailed how Count Fontanier had acted
                                like a madman, and that he attributed the destruction of all the
                                people to his firing his revolver at himself (Chunghow) and the
                                magistrate. He expressed great regret at what had occurred, and
                                owned that owing to the unexpectedness of the outbreak, the people
                                were masters of the position for that day. Mrs. Stanley and family
                                are living on board the Manchu, where other missionary ladies are
                                living, as well as Mrs. Forbes and Mrs. Stamman, merchants’ wives.
                                There are now no foreigners living in town. Chunghow saved the life
                                of one Frenchman named Contris, who was able to reach his yamun,
                                where he was cared for till he could be sent down to the British
                                settlement. I write this dispatch in great haste, as I am anxious to
                                dispatch it without delay. I am very much grieved that my first
                                letter has been returned.</p>
                            <p>Beside the Manchu, we have the British steamer Appin in port. The
                                Dragon had left, but some letters would reach her at Takoo, and we
                                will early see a gunboat here. There are no vessels of war here at
                                present.</p>
                            <p>The bodies of the consul, vice-consul, Tomassen and wife, the priest
                                Chevrier, and those of the Russians have all been got possession of,
                                and the latter buried.</p>

                            <head>Note to accompany Mr. Meadows’s letters.</head>
                            <p>Mr. Meadows, the United States vice-consul at Tien-tsin, is in the
                                employ of Chunghow as superintendent of the arsenal at Tien-tsin,
                                and, as a consequence, their acquaintance and intercourse are
                                intimate. Without imputing to Mr. Meadows any desire to misrepresent
                                facts, it is undoubtedly true that his personal friendship toward
                                Chunghow would cause him to believe the statements made by the
                                latter in preference to basing his opinion on the information which
                                comes through other sources. Mr. Meadows’s statements about what
                                took place at the yamun of Chunghow is substantially disproved by
                                all the testimony we get from other sources.</p>
                            <p>It is but natural that the Chinese officials should try to relieve
                                themselves of the grave responsibility, and they will be likely to
                                do so by every possible means. Hence their statements in regard to
                                the occurrences of the 21st should be accepted with caution unless
                                supported by other evidence.</p>
                            <p>It would appear to be an improbable story that the French consul
                                should attempt to take the lives of Chunghow and the district
                                magistrate, the men on whom he was obliged to rely for protection,
                                and whose aid it was the object of his visit to obtain.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your No. 9, with inclosures, instructing me to proceed, at
                            such time as it may be convenient to the admiral commanding the Asiatic
                            squadron, to Corea, for the purpose of negotiating a treaty for the
                            protection of shipwrecked mariners, and, if practicable, to secure
                            commercial advantages also. Since my arrival in China I have endeavored
                            to obtain all the information possible about Corea, but I regret to say
                            that my efforts have met with little success.</p>
                        <p>The Chinese government will, I doubt not, lend its good offices in aid of
                            our efforts in that direction, but it is questionable whether they will
                            prove of much practical utility.</p>
                        <p>Corea is substantially an independent nation. To be sure, it sends
                            tribute to China annually, but from the best information I am able to
                            obtain, the tribute is sent rather as a <hi rend="italic">quid pro
                                quo</hi> for the privilege of trading with the Chinese than as a
                            governmental tribute. It is brought annually by land, and is accompanied
                            by a large train of camels laden with Corean products, paper, ginseng,
                            &amp;c., for private trade and traffic. These trading expeditions are
                            allowed to remain in Pekin three months in each year.</p>
                        <p>Beyond these arrangements, which have been in existence many years, there
                            seems to be no connection between China and Corea. China claims or
                            exercises no control in any way over Corea, nor do the Coreans regard
                            the Chinese as having any right to interfere or exercise any control
                            over their governmental polity.</p>
                        <p>The object aimed at, in connection with the proposed expedition, is well
                            worth the effort, and I shall use all available means to make the <pb
                                n="363" xml:id="pg_363" facs="0397"/>negotiations a success;
                            although candor compels me to say I am not sanguine. I shall be glad to
                            avail myself of Mr. Seward’s experience and assistance in this matter;
                            hence no preparations will be made for the expedition until next year,
                            when he will be able to accompany me.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time the Department will be kept fully acquainted with all
                            the information I am able to obtain.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to my No. 12, of 27th ultimo,
                            concerning the late riot at Tien-tsin, I have now the honor to lay
                            before you sundry documents in further explanation of that painful
                            affair.</p>
                        <p>Since the riot occurred I have tried to gather all the information
                            possible in regard to it, its causes, and details; to ascertain where
                            the responsibility rests for this massacre, and the measures being taken
                            to punish the guilty, and afford redress for the outrages committed.</p>
                        <p>The opinions expressed in my No. 12, as to the cause of the riot, are in
                            some degree modified, but they are in no essential particular
                            changed.</p>
                        <p rend="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>The exact facts in regard to the killing of the consul and the other
                            people, and the destruction of the buildings, are involved somewhat in
                            doubt. The testimony in regard to these particulars is conflicting and
                            contradictory, and probably the precise truth never will be known. I see
                            no reason to alter or modify the opinions already expressed. Most if not
                            all the bodies of the foreigners killed have been recovered. Many of
                            them were horribly mutilated, indicating that the fury and fiendishness
                            of a mob composed of Chinese may be equaled, but cannot be excelled, by
                            the wild savages of the American continent.</p>
                        <p>The complicity of the local officials in this affair seems more certain,
                            the more it is investigated. When they saw the storm gathering they
                            failed to take any effective steps to prevent it, and the opinion is
                            general in Tien-tsin that the mob received direct aid and countenance
                            from the local officers and soldiers.</p>
                        <p>The belief is general among all classes that children are kidnapped and
                            sold by the natives for base purposes, and that this is true there seems
                            to be no doubt. The practice is reprobated by all classes, and the
                            guilty persons are punished without mercy when detected. When such a
                            practice exists it is not strange that foreigners should be liable to
                            suspicion also. The secrecy with which all matters connected with the
                            Sisters’ establishments are conducted renders them peculiarly liable to
                            suspicion in the eyes of ignorant people. To this may be added the
                            natural repugnance and hatred of the literati and gentry, who are ever
                            ready to take advantage of any rumor to arouse the prejudices of the
                            common people against foreigners, and impress upon them the belief that
                            “barbarians” are capable of atrocity too absurb for belief, except by
                            the ignorant and superstitious.</p>
                        <p>An excitement of a similar character occurred about the same time at
                            Nankin, several hundred miles distant, which seems to be a remarkable
                            coincidence. This could hardly be accounted as accidental, and <pb
                                n="364" xml:id="pg_364" facs="0398"/>affords grounds for the belief
                            which generally prevails among foreigners, that the riot at Tientsin was
                            not a sudden local excitement, but rather a part of a general plot to
                            arouse the prejudices and passions of the people, with a view to the
                            total extermination of the foreign residents. I am not prepared to
                            accept this view of the case, and shall not, until evidence can be
                            produced stronger than any that has come yet.</p>
                        <p>The particulars of the Nankin troubles are detailed with greater
                            clearness in the report of the governor general of that province to the
                            Foreign Office, a translation of which I inclose, (inclosure B.) It
                            appears from this that the excitement was as great, the same stories
                            were current in regard to the doings of the Catholics, and the danger as
                            imminent, as at Tien-tsin; and that violence was prevented by the
                            vigorous action of the local officials, coupled with the prudence of the
                            Catholic missionaries, who permitted a thorough inspection to be made of
                            their institution. This latter, it appears, went far to quiet the
                            apprehensions of the people, and prevent a popular outbreak.</p>
                        <p>I inclose several edicts and proclamations going to show what measures
                            are being taken by the government to punish the guilty parties and
                            afford redress for the outrages committed.</p>
                        <p>Tsang-kwohfan, who is deputed to investigate the whole affair, and is now
                            at Tien-tsin engaged in that business, is governor general of this
                            province, and one of the ablest officers in the empire. His name is
                            familiar to those who read our diplomatic correspondence as being the
                            author of a somewhat celebrated paper—a report to the Foreign Office in
                            1867 giving his opinions upon the different points of the British
                            treaty, which was then up for discussion and revision. This report,
                            although private and confidential to his own government, was
                            surreptitiously obtained in some way by the foreign legations, and
                            translated. It appears in Diplomatic Correspondence, 1868, Part I, pages
                            519, 520, and 521. He is a man of mature years, great experience in
                            official affairs, and generally regarded as anti-foreign in his views
                            and feelings. But, whatever his private feelings toward foreigners may
                            be, and however much he may desire that the empire should be restored to
                            its ancient exclusiveness, he has seen enough to satisfy himself that
                            this cannot be, and that all attempts to resist by force the peaceful
                            residence of foreigners in China, in accordance with treaty
                            stipulations, are acts of folly and madness. As an officer he will, I am
                            persuaded, duly appreciate the obligations imposed upon him to search
                            out and punish the guilty, and, in good faith, try to devise measures to
                            prevent a recurrence of such outrages in the future. But, whatever may
                            be done in the way of punishment and indemnity for the past, absolute
                            security in the future cannot be expected until the minds of the people
                            are divested of their absurd and wicked prejudices concerning
                            foreigners. This can only be accomplished by time, aided by the
                            influence of the governing class. The necessity of this education the
                            high officials are beginning to realize, and the importance of their
                            taking immediate action for this purpose is being constantly urged by
                            the diplomatic representatives residing here.</p>
                        <p>The decree appointing Tsunghow, or Chunghow, as his name is generally
                            rendered by foreigners, as imperial envoy to proceed to France to
                            endeavor to arrange this difficulty, appears to be a step in the right
                            direction. It evinces a disposition to conform their international
                            intercourse to the forms and usages of western nations.</p>
                        <p>As yet all is doubt and uncertainty about the demands for indemnity which
                            France will make. Telegraphic instructions via Russia are expected by
                            the French chargé d’affaires in a few days. He is now in <pb n="365"
                                xml:id="pg_365" facs="0399"/>Tien-tsin, where he has gone to meet
                            his admiral. A large fleet of foreign vessels of war is now in the
                            vicinity of Tien-tsin. Six gunboats— three French and three English—are
                            in the river; a French corvette lies outside the bar at the mouth of the
                            Pei-ho, and the flag-ships of the English and French squadrons, and some
                            other vessels, are at Che-foo. In addition to all these, two North
                            German corvets and a portion of the North Pacific Russian squadron are
                            daily expected at Che-foo.</p>
                        <p>I have written to the admiral commanding the United States Asiatic
                            squadron, informing him of the importance of having some force in the
                            North China waters, but it is doubted if any favorable response can be
                            made until the arrival of Admiral Rogers.</p>
                        <p>The present aspect of affairs certainly looks troubled; but I hope a
                            satisfactory settlement may be brought about without resort to
                            hostilities.</p>
                        <p>Speculations as to the future answer no useful purpose, as you will
                            undoubtedly learn the progress of events, and possibly the final result,
                            before this can reach you.</p>
                        <p>My action will be controlled in a great measure by events as they occur.
                            It will be my first duty to see that citizens of the United States are
                            allowed to participate in all the rights and privileges granted to other
                            nations. Beyond this I shall not consider it my duty to interfere,
                            except in a general way, for benefit and future security.</p>

                            <p>M. <hi rend="smallcaps">le Comte:</hi> Our little city of Tien-tsin,
                                usually so quiet, has for some clays been disturbed by the cries of
                                noisy mobs in the neighborhood of the establishment of the Sisters
                                of Charity and this consulate. The Sisters are accused of taking out
                                the eyes of children, and some of the boldest have dug up the bodies
                                of those taken from their hospital. Lately the intendant (taotai) of
                                this circuit wished to show me the deposition of many witnesses who
                                declared that they had been victims of the persons employed by our
                                missionaries to recruit young children for them. I had no difficulty
                                in proving to him that all these rumors were the result of ill-will;
                                but as he had presented the matter officially, I promised, on his
                                repeated demand, to see to it that our Sisters of Charity should
                                employ only persons of tried character.</p>
                            <pb n="366" xml:id="pg_366" facs="0400"/>
                            <p>Some hours after this meeting on the 19th, the district magistrate
                                (chihien) came to the consulate, accompanied by a deputy from
                                Chunghow, with the design of provoking forthwith an official
                                investigation of the houses of the Sisters and Lazarest
                                missionaries. But as he committed the impropriety of getting into a
                                passion, and even of threatening me with the resentment of the
                                people, apparently determined to exact from me that which his
                                superiors only a few hours before had left entirely to my judgment,
                                I took advantage of it to break off the interview by recalling to
                                his notice that it was only with the superintendent of the three
                                northern ports that I intended to continue this affair; but that I
                                should none the less hold him responsible for the consequences of
                                the troubles he seemed to be so willing to threaten me with, and of
                                which I was persuaded he was the sole instigator.</p>
                            <p>I requested the deputy from Chunghow to inform his excellency of the
                                result of my interview with the district magistrate until I could go
                                myself to complain to him personally of the unbecoming conduct of
                                this official. I had the pleasure yesterday morning to receive a
                                visit from Chunghow. He spoke in strong terms of reprobation of this
                                magistrate, though meanwhile trying to excuse him. I complained to
                                him how little value the local authorities had given to his remarks
                                when he had tried to contradict the false rumors circulated against
                                our missionaries, the final cause of which must be found in the
                                obligation to let them adopt a course in which he had refused to
                                join, which had attached to him anew the epithet of “The Right Arm
                                of Europeans.”</p>
                            <p>This little incident, which would perhaps have taken a bad turn,
                                unless Chunghow had interfered, now seems to me to-day to be pretty
                                much finished. He has, more-over, promised me that in a few days he
                                will issue a short proclamation to quiet the minds of the
                                people.</p>

                                    to the Foreign Office.</hi></p>
                            <p>I have received the dispatch [from the Foreign Office] stating that
                                M. de Rochechouart had announced his intention of starting for
                                Kiangs and Chehkiang provinces from Tien-tsin, for the purpose of
                                ascertaining, by secret inquiry, whether it was true or not that the
                                Roman Catholic establishments have been criminated by persons,
                                [charged with kin napping;] when the startling news was received
                                that there had been a tumult at Tien-tsin in consequence of these
                                establishments having been criminated by kidnappers, in which the
                                French consul, M. Fontainer, had been killed by the-mob. I was
                                accordingly directed to issue confidential instructions to the local
                                authorities that whenever a case of kidnapping occurred, which in
                                any way implicated the Roman Catholics, they should investigate the
                                matter to the bottom, and be careful not to give ready credence to
                                idle rumors, lest they might by so doing give rise to
                                disturbance.</p>
                            <p>About the last of May and the first part of June, cases were
                                constantly reported of children being missing, both within and
                                without the city of Nankin, and those arrested, on being narrowly
                                examined, did make statements that implicated the Roman Catholics,
                                but none of them being supported by any satisfactory proofs it was
                                not thought expedient to follow up the charges by inquiring of them.
                                But although these cases were disposed of, the people incessantly
                                complained of children being beguiled and carried off, and the
                                excitement increased. One kidnapper was taken almost in the act, and
                                when before the authorities, he stated that a man named Choo
                                Teh-shing, belonging to the Roman Catholic establishment, was his
                                principal. This increased the difficulty of disarming popular
                                suspicion. As the rumors circulated, they changed their character,
                                and became so truculent that people shuddered when they heard them,
                                and the citizens were so exasperated that it was almost impossible
                                to restrain them.</p>
                            <p>I gave orders accordingly to the provincial commissions and
                                intendants who direct the committee of reorganization, <note n="*"
                                    xml:id="d225fn1">* Office of supplementation, a body of
                                    magistrates and others which have been supposed to be bringing
                                    the affairs of the province into order since its recovery from
                                    the Taiping rebels.</note> that as soon as they had convicted
                                the kidnappers now in custody to punish the whole by martial law,
                                that the wrath of the people might be appeased. At the same time I
                                put forth a proclamation stating all the particulars, and charging
                                the people not to listen to these unfounded rumors; and further
                                directed an officer of the committee charged with foreign business
                                to inform the resident Roman Catholic priest, in writing, of the
                                rumors that were in circulation. He replied, defending himself, and
                                begged that measures might be taken to prevent any trouble. This
                                took place just after the dragon-boat festival on June 3, and it was
                                brought to my notice that the population had not abandoned their
                                suspicions. It was also ascertained that vagrant people and lovers
                                of mischief were exciting them to such a pitch that a day had
                                actually been fixed on which all the able-bodied men in the city
                                were engaged to meet and go together to the Roman Catholic
                                establishment. This project, and many others being talked of, I at
                                once sent orders to the heads of the various <pb n="367"
                                    xml:id="pg_367" facs="0401"/>wards, and subordinate officers
                                among the gentry, explicitly directing them to arrest any person
                                found spreading these stories for mischievous purposes. The prefect
                                and district magistrates, attended by a number of the gentry and
                                literati, also went at the same time to the Roman Catholic
                                establishment. The missionary took them all over the rooms, and into
                                every corner of the building, but they found nothing whatever out of
                                the common way, and consequently, as soon as it was proved that
                                there was no evidence there for these stories current, popular
                                suspicion began to subside.</p>
                            <p>Both in the city and suburbs, however, people still continued in a
                                state of alarm and unrest, which led me to issue fresh proclamations
                                on this head, and secretly to detail soldiers to patrol by day and
                                night all the roads and streets most carefully, with a view to
                                relieve the apprehensions of the people. By these means after the
                                middle of June men’s minds were calmed and the Roman Catholics and
                                people were as friendly as ever. This is a full account of the
                                measures taken in Nankin during the last month with reference to
                                kidnapping.</p>
                            <p>I have received nothing in writing from Chehkiang province to show
                                whether anything of this sort has happened there or not, but I have
                                heard that some cases of beguiling and kidnapping did occur in May
                                in the province of Nganheoni. The excitement in Tien-tsin began in
                                that month, but it is beyond my comprehension how there should have
                                been movements in several provinces north and south, so identical in
                                time and purpose.</p>
                            <p>The space within the walls of Nankin is large and disconnected. Its
                                inhabitants are ordinarily from all parts of the empire, not
                                one-half of them being natives of the place. This is examination
                                year, too, and great numbers of students and traders will assemble,
                                which makes strict surveillance throughout the quarters difficult.
                                As a precautionary measure, however, I am erecting guard-houses at
                                all the important points in the several wards and about the market
                                places, in which the guards can mutually help and observe each other
                                in their watching. The committee of reorganization are to see that
                                in every ward registry door-tickets are made for each dwelling
                                house, and will take precautions that the registry of the people be
                                done so as not to distress them. They will merely enjoin on every
                                tithing that its inhabitants exercise such mutual vigilance within
                                its limits that bad characters will have no refuge for
                                themselves.</p>
                            <p>I have also directed an officer from the committee of foreign trade
                                to go to the English and French missionaries here, and civilly urge
                                them to move out of the way while the examinations are going on, so
                                that causes of collisions with the students may be avoided. The
                                Protestant missionaries occupy a rented house and chapel near the
                                examination hall, and they agree to move away while the examination
                                is held, but the new church of the Roman Catholics in one street
                                overlooks the prefectural college in another, and they declared that
                                they had nowhere to go. but were willing to shut their gates and
                                keep indoors till it was over. But lest the students should go to
                                the place and get into dispute with the inmates, I have enjoined
                                upon every one of the literary chancellors and those in charge to
                                urge on the students to avoid whatever will produce disturbance.
                                Thus it is to be hoped that all parties will keep peace; and I now
                                give this detail of the precautionary measures which I have adopted
                                for your information.</p>

                                sends a reply:</p>
                            <p>I yesterday had the honor to receive the collective note of your
                                excellencies, in which you refer to the murder of the French consul,
                                priests, missionaries, and others at Tien-tsin, and inquire whether
                                the officers and people of other countries residing at that port can
                                be protected from violence. You also suggest whether the means for
                                assuring the safety of foreigners in other provinces are adequate
                                for the purpose, and advise that firm measures for this end be
                                speedily taken, so that their persons and property may be secure;
                                and, lastly, urge the condign punishment of those who have been
                                guilty in the riot at Tien-tsin, &amp;c.</p>
                            <p>In relation to the circumstances of this riot at Tien-tsin, and what
                                has been done to repress it and punish the actors, I have already
                                stated to your excellencies the steps which have been taken. Since
                                then Tsunghow has received dispatches from the consuls, and such
                                measures have been adopted that there is, apparently, not the least
                                probability of further disturbance.</p>
                            <p>With regard to the necessity of taking precautionary measures in the
                                other provinces, I may state, further, that the most stringent
                                orders have been sent to the several governors-general and governors
                                to enjoin upon their subordinates to exert the utmost diligence in
                                protecting foreigners of every class residing within their
                                jurisdictions. Should lawless vagabonds stir up strife and seek
                                occasion against them, such are to be <pb n="368" xml:id="pg_368"
                                    facs="0402"/>instantly seized and punished with the utmost rigor
                                that the law requires, so that the two, foreigners and natives, may
                                dwell together in enduring peace.</p>
                            <p>It is for the purpose of making known what has been done in this
                                matter, that I now send this communication for the information of
                                your excellencies.</p>

                            <p>Prince Kung, chief secretary of state for foreign affairs, herewith
                                sends a commumtion:</p>
                            <p>I was yesterday honored by receiving the following imperial
                                decree:</p>
                            <p>“Let Tsunghow, a vice-president of the board of war and
                                superintendent of trade for the three northern ports, be invested
                                with full powers to go to France as our imperial envoy. Respect
                                this.”</p>
                            <p>On the same day I also received the following imperial decree:</p>
                            <p>“Tsunghow having been sent abroad as our envoy, let Chinglin
                                temporarily fill the post of superintendent of trade for the three
                                northern ports. Respect this.”</p>
                            <p>I have caused these decrees to be carefully copied, and now send them
                                for your excellency’s information.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                                receipt of your highness’s dispatch of yesterday, containing copies
                                of two imperial decrees respecting the appointment of Tsunghow as
                                imperial envoy to France, and of Chinglin to fill the post of
                                superintendent of the three northern ports for the time, &amp;c.</p>
                            <p>His excellency Tsunghow has so long been in charge of the trade at
                                Tien-tsin that he has become thoroughly conversant with it; and of
                                all the details connected with the recent riot at that city, the
                                killing of the French consul, and what followed, he was an
                                eye-witness. In respect, therefore, to the causes of this excitement
                                and the subsequent attack, he will, in his position of imperial
                                envoy to France, be able to fully explain all that took place on
                                that occasion, and remove the apprehensions of the French people as
                                to what may grow out of this very serious affair. The origin and
                                progress of the agitation up to the final outbreak are all well
                                known to him, so that his appointment at this juncture as a special
                                envoy seems to me to be a wise step.</p>
                            <p>The high officer Chinglin, who has already filled the post of
                                intendant and collector at Neuchwang, has been well spoken of by the
                                American consul at that port as well versed in the details of trade,
                                and an officer who executes the duties devolving on him with equity
                                and consideration. His appointment to temporarily fill the post of
                                superintendent of trade for the three northern ports is, therefore,
                                likely to prove satisfactory to all, and is very agreeable to
                                me.</p>
                            <p>I have the honor to be, sir, your imperial highness’s obedient
                                servant,</p>

                            <p>Prince Kung, chief secretary of state for foreign affairs, herewith
                                makes a communication:</p>
                            <p>On the 28th instant I was honored by receiving the following imperial
                                decree:</p>
                            <p>“In consequence of wicked men having kidnapped young children in the
                                prefecture of Tien-tsin, and implicated therein the establishment of
                                the [Roman Catholic] religionists, the people of the city had their
                                suspicions aroused, and raised a riot in which the French consul was
                                killed by the mob, the churches burned, and many other persons lost
                                their lives, together with some Russian merchants, who were
                                unintentionally killed. The whole affair and all the acts committed
                                are much to be deplored.</p>
                            <p>“We have already ordered that Tsunghow and all the local officers who
                                have managed matters so badly in this affair be delivered over to
                                the board [of civil office] to decide upon their punishment, and
                                also directed that Tsang Kwoh-fan go there and inquire what are the
                                real facts of the case, and send up a report, and also seize the
                                miscreants who carried off human beings and the ringleaders of this
                                riot, and execute the penalties of the law upon the guilty.</p>
                            <p>“The provisions of the treaties now in force have hitherto proved to
                                be adequate for everything connected with the trade and intercourse
                                with other countries, and under them natives and foreigners have now
                                for a long time got along amicably, our government regarding them
                                both with the same kindness. But in discriminating between the good
                                and the evil no one should ask whether a man belongs to a sect or
                                not, for wherever unscrupulous fellows are found sheltering
                                themselves under the name of Catholics to act traitorously, and
                                violate the laws, they must be arrested immediately and strict
                                examination made that just punishment may be inflicted. It is
                                impossible to permit men to circulate unfounded rumors and
                                recklessly stir up strife and riot.</p>
                            <p>“It is to be feared that owing to this conflict and ill-will between
                                the people and the Catholics at Tien-tsin the inhabitants of other
                                provinces will have their suspicions aroused, and excite strife
                                against them, and, therefore, let all the chief provincial
                                authorities give the strictest orders to all their subordinates
                                throughout their jurisdiction to publish explicit proclamations upon
                                this matter, and take proper measures to repress all attempts at
                                rising. Wherever merchants and missionaries are found let them have
                                adequate protection whenever they require it, and by no means let
                                the ignorant people be excited to disorder by rumors or other

                            <p>Tsang, a cabinet minister, governor general of the province of
                                Chihli, &amp;c., &amp;e., hereby issues the following
                                proclamation:</p>
                            <p>I have been honored with repeated orders from the throne in reference
                                to the occurrences of the 21st ultimo, directing me to examine into
                                and settle them in the strictest justice, without calling on the
                                troops. All classes, both official and unofficial, ought, therefore,
                                to endeavor earnestly to carry out his Majesty’s intentions, so that
                                this affair may be settled and the minds of people quieted.</p>
                            <p>To this end I now issue this proclamation, ordering the inhabitants
                                of this place to quietly attend to their own affairs as usual, and
                                strictly forbidding them to gather in crowds, or wander through the
                                streets and markets in crowds of ten or a hundred, circulating wild
                                rumors designed to alarm and stir up the people. You are also
                                forbidden to assemble about the foreign houses and shipping to stir
                                up strife and rancor.</p>
                            <p>In all my examination into the causes, and inquiry as to who is
                                implicated in this affair, I shall exercise strict equity while
                                carrying on the examination; in no case will I show any partiality,
                                but do justly by all. Let every one carefully obey this special
                                proclamation.</p>

                                    the Tien-tsin riot and its causes.</hi></p>
                            <p>Extract from a dispatch of Tsunghow to the United States vice-consul
                                at Tien-tsin, dated July 14, 1870, containing copy of a letter to
                                him from Tsang-Kwoh-fan, governor general of the province.</p>
                            <p rend="center">* * * * * * *</p>
                            <p>I have received his Majesty’s orders to come to Tien-tsin and, in
                                concert with your excellency, to make a thorough investigation into
                                the riot here on the 21st of June, and learn the causes for the
                                animosity which led to it. It appears that villanous men have been
                                bewitching and carrying off children, in which they have implicated
                                the Roman Catholic establishments, and assert that these people
                                extract the eyes and open the hearts of the children to put into
                                certain medicines. Not only have the ignorant and vulgar been
                                carried away by these idle rumors, but even the educated gentry and
                                officials have confirmed them by their assent. These causes have
                                been operating till suspicion has produced hatred, and angry
                                passions have been stirred up, until this serious catastrophe has
                                come to pass. It is imperatively necessary, therefore, to learn the
                                real facts about these things, so that the true may be distinguished
                                from the false, the guileless from the malicious, and everybody
                                enabled to understand the rights of the case. These exciting rumors
                                are not alone prevalent at Tien-tsin, but were rife in former years
                                in the provinces of Hunan and Kiangsi; and last year extraordinary
                                placards were posted up anonymously in the cities of Yangchau, in
                                Kiangsu, and Tienman; in Hupeh, and in those of Kwangping and
                                Ta-ming, in this province. Some of the charges brought forward were
                                that the Roman Catholics beguiled and kidnapped children; others
                                said that they took out their eyes and opened their hearts; and
                                lastly, that they deceived women into their quarters to defile them.
                                But although the occurrences at these towns were all judicially
                                inquired into and settled, no attempt was ever made to search into
                                their causes, to learn the truth of the statements made in the
                                placards and exciting rumors, and clear up the whole matter.</p>
                            <p>Since I reached Tien-tsin I have most carefully inquired into the
                                charges brought against the Roman Catholics of bewitching and
                                kidnapping children. While the man Wangsan acknowledged in his
                                examination that he had done so, yet he has since denied that he
                                confessed, and his statement does not at all agree with the original
                                testimony of W“Lanchin respecting their complicity, nor is there the
                                least proof that any one at the mission ever employed him for such a
                                purpose.</p>
                            <p>Furthermore, the one hundred and fifty boys and girls brought from
                                the hospital of the Sisters of Charity have all been questioned, one
                                after another, and agree in saying that they have been there under
                                instruction a long time, and that their relatives brought them to
                                the institution to be reared and taught. Not one of them had been
                                kidnapped, or in any way cajoled to come there.</p>
                            <p>The stories about their taking out eyes and opening hearts are also
                                mere unfounded rumors, without a shadow of evidence to uphold them.
                                There were many deaths at the hospital in the months of May and
                                June, and sometimes two or three bodies were put into the same
                                coffin, which gave rise to great suspicions among the people. They
                                remarked, too, that its doors were constantly kept closed and
                                everything carried on with such secrecy that no one could tell what
                                was done inside, which of course gave rise to increased suspicion
                                and dread. Rumors arose on every side, spreading these accusations
                                by myriads of tongues, but to get at their truth would have been
                                like trying to clutch the wind or seize a shadow.</p>
                            <p>When I first got here, the people came around me by hundreds, handing
                                in their petitions about this affair. I have personally examined
                                many of them and asked for the proof of what they allege about
                                taking out eyes and hearts; but not one can point to a single case
                                within his knowledge. Nor is there any evidence to show that any
                                family in the city or suburbs of Tien-tsin has lost young children;
                                for if such a case had come before the courts, it would have
                                furnished a means of thoroughly investigating the matter. On the
                                whole, therefore, my inquires have convinced me that there is no
                                foundation for the rumors, nor can I ascertain how they have arisen;
                                and it seems advisable for your excellency and myself to immediately
                                report these circumstances to the throne, in order to put a stop to
                                these unfounded rumors and suspicions.</p>
                            <p>As to the charges that they (the Roman Catholic missionaries) kill
                                children and mutilate their bodies for the purpose of concocting
                                medicine out of their organs, it may be replied that even wild
                                savages and fierce barbarians refuse to act thus; how much less,
                                then, the English and French, those mighty nations, beyond the sea?
                                Can it be supposed that they do such cruel and detestable deeds? It
                                stands to reason that there has been nothing of the kind.</p>
                            <p>If persons belonging to the Roman Catholic sect commit crimes, rob,
                                or try to kidnap people, and think to screen themselves from
                                punishment by alleging that they are members of it, it will not do
                                to release them; they must suffer the penalty of the law; nor can
                                any criminal be discharged because he is one of the sects. The Roman
                                Catholic faith <pb n="371" xml:id="pg_371" facs="0405"/>teaches
                                people to do good, and Ms sacred Majesty the Emperor Humane (Kanhi)
                                long ago permitted missionaries to exercise and teach their faith.
                                The hospitals of the Sisters of Charity are like our foundling
                                hospitals or old men’s asylums, having for their chief object to
                                relieve the wretched and help the poor, in doing which they lay out
                                large sums annually. Their name itself, jin-tsz, means <hi
                                    rend="italic">humane</hi> and <hi rend="italic">kind,</hi> and
                                should be sufficient to disarm the slander which accuses their
                                managers of such horrid cruelties. It will be hard to appease the
                                wrath of foreigners for this.</p>
                            <p>It will be proper for us to memorialize the Emperor, requesting that
                                orders be sent to all the provincial rulers, advising them that all
                                irritating anonymous placards formerly circulated about the Roman
                                Catholics killing and cutting up human beings are all malicious and
                                unfounded assertions, and ordering them to take measures to redress
                                the wrongs of foreigners and completely dissipate the
                                misapprehensions of the people. These things should be proclaimed
                                over the empire, so that every one shall hear and understand them;
                                and mayhap the fears and suspicions of all, both natives and
                                foreigners, will be removed, and the mutual ill-will of the people
                                and the Roman Catholics gradually cease, and peace be restored.</p>
                            <p>If you agree with these views, it will be proper to make them known
                                at once to the merchants; and I should like a reply showing that it
                                has been done.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The alarm which the Tien-tsin tragedy
                            produced does not subside. On the contrary, the feeling of insecurity
                            and peril among foreigners seems to increase.</p>
                        <p>The Protestant missionaries in Tien-tsin have been gathering the
                            testimony of native Christians, and upon this they base opinions and
                            publish them, which, though honest, are for from being true, judged by
                            the testimony, direct and corroborative, that comes to me from all
                            sources.</p>
                        <p>As a sample of the letters which are given to the public through the
                            newspapers, I send herewith (inclosure A) one from Rev. Mr. Stanley, of
                            Tien-tsin, to me, which he thought of sufficient importance to publish
                            in Shanghai papers. In it, you will observe, he gives it as his opinion
                            that the riot at Tien-tsin was a part of a grand plot to massacre or
                            drive out all foreigners residing in China, and not a local uprising
                            against one nationality and one religious creed. With the original of
                            this letter Mr. Stanley sent me the affidavits or statements of a number
                            of native Christians.</p>
                        <p rend="center">* * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>One of the witnesses deposed that he was arrested by the mob as a
                            “Christian,” taken to a building or a prison, and detained until
                            evening; when examined he was able to prove that he was a Protestant and
                            a member of an American church, when he was immediately released and
                            safely conducted to the foreign settlement. If this statement be true
                            (and it is corroborated by the other testimony) it goes to show that Mr.
                            Stanley’s opinions are erroneous, arid that the fury of the mob was
                            directed against the Roman Catholics alone.</p>
                        <p>Rumors of threatened attack are almost daily put in circulation, which,
                            upon investigation, usually prove to be without foundation other than
                            the belief of some native Christian. These stories always increase in
                            size and intensity in the relating, and are finally embodied in
                            communications to the Shanghai newspapers for publication, and by this
                            means gain a large circulation. From the newspapers the stories are
                            translated and told to the Chinese, and by them related to one another
                            in the <pb n="372" xml:id="pg_372" facs="0406"/>remote parts of the
                            empire. All this is calculated to excite alarm among foreigners, and
                            this alarm leads the ignorant natives to believe that they are really
                            powerful enough to expel all foreigners.</p>
                        <p rend="center">* * * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>To-day I received a copy of a letter written by Mr. Stanley to Commander
                            Taylor, of the United States steamer Ashuelot, now lying at Tien-tsin,
                            which I inclose, (inclosure B.) This you will observe is based on the
                            opinions of “native Christians” alone. A copy of the letter was sent by
                            Mr. Stanley to Pekin and circulated among the missionaries, which, as a
                            matter of course, created much alarm. A portion of the statement I know
                            to be incorrect, and I hope the balance has no foundation in fact. This
                            paper is sent merely as a sample of the reports that gain currency
                            almost daily, in which foreigners place more or less reliance, and serve
                            to keep up excitement and create alarm as to their personal safety.</p>
                        <p>An inspection of the Protestant chapels discloses the fact that the
                            damage is much greater than I was led to believe was the case by the
                            first reports. The local officials at Tien-tsin appear to be desirous of
                            affording reparation promptly—either to rebuild the chapels or pay
                            equitable damages; and I instructed the vice-consul to see the
                            missionaries, ascertain the cost of the buildings and the damages
                            sustained, to the end that prompt reparation might be made by the
                            Chinese.</p>
                        <p>A large amount of correspondence ensued between the missionaries, the
                            consul, and myself, copies of which are hardly necessary to send you;
                            nor is it possible, were it desirable, with the inadequate clerical
                            force attached to this legation. I inclose, however a printed slip, from
                            a newspaper, (inclosure C,) which contains the reply of the English
                            missionaries to her Majesty’s consul, upon the same subject. The ideas
                            embodied in the letters of the American missionaries are about the same
                            as the English, but the duties of foreign nations and their
                            representatives in China are elaborated and defined with greater
                            particularity by the former. They close their communication to me by
                            saying that until it is known what reparation France will demand they
                            are not prepared to agree upon a settlement.</p>
                        <p>Both the American and English missionaries appear to be impressed with
                            the belief that they are somehow specially charged with diplomatic
                            functions by their governments, in addition to their self-imposed task
                            of taking care of the spiritual welfare of the Chinese; and, according
                            to their diplomatic judgment, a war between France and China must first
                            take place before it is proper to adjust any claims for property
                            destroyed in the late riot at Tien-tsin. I have notified them that when
                            they are ready for a settlement I shall be prepared to present and urge
                            the payment of a just claim for damages, but until they signify their
                            willingness to act I shall take no further steps in the matter.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir: As</hi> strenuous efforts are being made by
                                the Chinese authorities and some others to invest the recent
                                occurrences at Tien-tsin with the nature of a popular outbreak and
                                as directed against the Catholics alone, I desire to lay before you
                                some evidence indicating that such is not the case.</p>
                            <p>It is well known that the rumors at first pointed more especially to
                                the Catholics, particularly to the Sisters of Charity.</p>
                            <pb n="373" xml:id="pg_373" facs="0407"/>
                            <p>It is equally well known that these rumors soon referred to the
                                entire foreign population of Tien-tsin, and that a day was fixed and
                                arrangements made for an attack on the French consulate,
                                Tien-chu-tang, <note n="*" xml:id="d226fn1">Tien-chu-tang, (Catholic
                                    cathedral, Jêr tsz-tang, (Sisters of Charity establishment.) Not
                                    inclosed.</note> Jên-tsz-tang, and other places in and near the
                                city, viz., the 21st of June, (23d of the 5th moon.) and that the
                                following Friday, June 24, was fixed as the day for attacking the
                                foreign settlement.</p>
                            <p>Being absent on a mission tour at the time, I found indefinite rumors
                                of an intended attack on the foreign residents of Tien-tsin in
                                circulation about the 25th ultimo at Têh Chow, a city 500 li distant
                                from Tien-tsin. Mr. Hodge, of the English Methodist mission, heard
                                the same at Lau-ling, about 400 li distant, and that the 21st and
                                24th of June were the days fixed on for the attack. In both cases
                                the event was spoken of as future, and no distinction in the
                                nationality of foreigners was made.</p>
                            <p>On the morning of the tragic day the Taotai, Futai, and Chih-hsien
                                visited the Tien-chu-tang, and were shown over the entire premises.
                                They made no effort to disperse the great crowd that had followed
                                them and collected in front of the place nor to assure the people
                                that they found no evidence of the foul deeds charged upon the
                                Romanists. It is certain that very soon after their departure the
                                fire-gongs sounded and the attack commenced; that the military
                                officer, Chên-ta-swai, (or Kwo-kui,) arrived with some soldiers and
                                closed the bridge of boats, (which had been opened by order of
                                Chung-ta-jên, to prevent the mob from crossing,) and aided the
                                rabble in its work.</p>
                            <p>At the sound of the gongs—the usual fire signal—all the fire guilds
                                rushed to arms, instead of seizing their buckets, as ordinarily, and
                                hastened toward the French consulate and Tien-chu-tang. From first
                                to last the members of these fire guilds were among the most active
                                in the work of destruction and death.</p>
                            <p>The first attack was made on the French consulate, and had actually
                                commenced before the consul went to Chung’s Yamên. Some or all of
                                its inmates—including Mr. Thommasin, secretary of French legation,
                                and wife, just arrived—were murdered before he left the Yamên, and
                                he was murdered on his way back to the consulate in charge of
                                Chung’s escort.</p>
                            <p>No sooner had the destruction of the French consulate and the
                                Tien-chu-tang been completed than the crowd rushed off to the
                                Jên-tsz tang, where ten Sisters of Charity were subjected to the
                                most horrible death, and their premises burned.</p>
                            <p>A portion of the mob then made for the Protestant chapels, all of
                                which, eight in number, were despoiled of everything valuable and
                                their walls, in many cases, torn down. A portion of the mob, yelling
                                with rage, started for the foreign settlement, with the avowed
                                purpose of killing all foreigners and sacking the place. We know not
                                what prevented their coming, unless it be that their numbers seemed
                                too few and they would violate the original plan. Three Russians,
                                fleeing from the city, were killed while begging for mercy on the
                                plea, “We are not French!” “No matter, we will kill all foreigners!”
                                was the reply.</p>
                            <p>An attempt was also made to fire the steeple of the settlement
                                church—a signal, doubtless, for the descent of the mob.</p>
                            <p>From the first the ruffians have asserted their expectation of aid
                                from the governor general’s army, and it is positively known that
                                soldiers from the Chên-tai Yamên were among the most active in the
                                destruction of the French consulate, Tien-chu-tang, and one of the
                                chapels of the American board; and, as above indicated, that the mob
                                was encouraged, if not directly led, in the attack on the former
                                places, by a military mandarin named Chen. His language, on passing
                                the bridge, was, “Go on, my boys, and burn” (them.)</p>
                            <p>There is no evidence that the rumor concerning the employment of men
                                by the Sisters to kidnap children for unholy purposes, viz., to get
                                their eyes, hearts, and brains for medicine, is true; nor is there
                                evidence that the consul fired a gun or revolver in Chung’s Yamên.
                                Circumstantial evidence is against both rumors. Probably the exact
                                truth cannot now be ascertained.</p>
                            <p>I would call attention to the testimony of Yong ü, concerning a visit
                                paid to the burial-place of coffins said to have been brought from
                                the Jên-tsz-t’ang. Others visited the place, and hear a similar
                                testimony. Only one or two were new coffins. They saw, at most, only
                                bones and a little hair, and utterly repudiate the idea of their
                                being recent interments.</p>
                            <p>Also to the testimony of Yü-chü-lei, concerning the effect on the
                                crowd, as witnessed by himself, when the bugle sounded in the
                                Chen-tai Yarnên. Taken in connection (and only when so taken) with
                                the fact that the soldiers took an active part in pulling down and
                                plundering my chapel, as seen by him and Yang-sien-sêng, and their
                                reported activity in the destruction and murders at other places,
                                this is a significant fact.</p>
                            <p>I would also direct attention to the incendiary nature of the
                                proclamation, a copy of which I inclosed.†</p>
                            <p>1. The names “swan,” to hind, and “kwai,” to kidnap, are such as no
                                Chinaman would be likely to select as a cognomen, and give an
                                apocryphal look to the persons.</p>
                            <pb n="374" xml:id="pg_374" facs="0408"/>
                            <p>2. The phrase “commissioned by persons” is exceedingly objectionable,
                                and unbecoming an official in its indefiniteness. The people at once
                                said he referred to the Catholics. He could have hardly put it more
                                ingeniously, considering the state of feeling among the people, in
                                order to excite the populace.</p>
                            <p>It should be remembered that each fire guild has a head or chief, who
                                is a literary man, and whose name is enrolled in the Yamên. The
                                members of these guilds dare not arm, or participate in any
                                uprising, as in this case, without the knowledge and consent of
                                their chief. Would they dare countenance any such demonstration as
                                this, contrary to the known wishes of the mandarin, or without his
                                knowledge?</p>
                            <p>The volunteer force “twan lien,” organized years ago, in rebel times,
                                has also a literary man for its chief, whose name is in the Yamên
                                roll. The same may be asked concerning him. Yet the “twan lien” were
                                engaged in the horrid affair.</p>
                            <p>Little companies of firemen and Yamên retainers had been observed
                                frequently, during the few previous days, collecting here and there,
                                and unpleasant demonstrations made toward native Christians and
                                foreigners. I may instance the case of Mrs. Stanley, the peering
                                into her face, jostling of the crowd against her, and the insulting
                                language used, as early as June 5, Sabbath. Also the case of Mr. and
                                Mrs. Turnock, on Sabbath, 19th June, on their way to one of the
                                chapels. In passing such a group, collected on the steps of a
                                temple, insulting language was used, a thing formerly very rare
                                here, and brickbats picked up, though none were thrown.</p>
                            <p>Do not these gatherings explain the universality and speed with which
                                the firemen flew to arms when the fire signal sounded, and from all
                                quarters proceeded to the French consulate ?</p>
                            <p>If those connected with the Tun-cliu-chian—especially the Sisters of
                                Charity—were the only objects of popular hatred, why was the
                                consulate the first object of attack? Why was a French merchant and
                                wife, living a mile away from the Tien-chu-t’ang, among the first
                                victims? Or if the feeling extended to their coreligionists and
                                fellow-countrymen only, why were the Russians brutally cut down
                                while begging for mercy, and known not to be French, with the cry,
                                “Death to all foreigners?”</p>
                            <p>Why was diligent search made for the Protestant missionaries in their
                                chapels, for the purpose (avowed) of killing them, and all (8) their
                                chapels destroyed? Why were our converts beaten, robbed, driven from
                                their homes, dragged before the magistrates, and why still subjected
                                to a bitter malice? Why did the mob start for the settlement with
                                purposes of blood and plunder?</p>
                            <p>If simply popular movement, why, in the already excited state of
                                feeling, did the magistrates issue those incendiary proclamations?
                                Why did they not seek of the consuls a thorough investigation of the
                                matter, and take all necessary means to allay the excitement?</p>
                            <p>Why did they not issue counter-proclamations, as desired by Mr. Lees
                                of the London. Mission Society? Why did they allow a large crowd to
                                follow them and collect at the French consulate, and go away without
                                an effort to disperse it, or correct the erroneous charges and views
                                of the people? Why have the people from the first claimed the
                                officials as siding with them, if they had no reason for so
                                doing?</p>
                            <p>Why did the soldiers and firemen render such efficient aid in the
                                work of destruction, if their chiefs, the officials, were opposed to
                                it?</p>
                            <p>At a place 50 li from this, where I spent the night of July 1, the
                                frequent remark in the street was, “All the foreigners at Tien-tsin
                                are dead—we might as well kill this one and end them.” The
                                impression if not the expression is significant.</p>
                            <p>Notwithstanding proclamations forbidding to carry or manufacture
                                arms, both have been done openly to the present time; and at the
                                five quarters, and other places, arms are exposed ready for use.</p>
                            <p>Until the present time no attempt has been made, so far as we can
                                hear, to apprehend any of the rioters. Some of them are as loud as
                                ever in their threats of an attack on the settlement.</p>
                            <p>In conclusion, I would enter my solemn protest against the efforts of
                                some to show—1st. That the feeling was and is only against the
                                Catholics. Evidence to the contrary is too strong. Even admitting
                                it, humanity cries out against such heartless and unchristian
                                assumptions as that they brought upon themselves a deserved fate.
                                Justice even to bitterest enemies. 2d. That the mob partook of the
                                nature of a public excitement merely. Evidence is abundant that, but
                                for official encouragement, such a tragedy could not have been
                                enacted. The history of these mobs against foreigners, within the
                                last few years, would be full of interest.</p>
                            <p>And may I express the hope that such a settlement of this affair will
                                be made as to render the repetition of such barbarous deeds all but
                                impossible? I am no advocate of cruel or retaliative measures. But
                                justice and humanity alike demand a firm and decided action in the
                                fear of God.</p>
                            <p>Let the conduct of these officials be thoroughly investigated and
                                their actions sifted. Let them know that where evidence is so strong
                                „they cannot cast the blame on an innocent people, or pay a few
                                dollars and wipe out the stain of bloodshed and cruelties too
                                horrible and heartrending to mention.</p>
                            <pb n="375" xml:id="pg_375" facs="0409"/>
                            <p>America has lost no children; but others have, and we should stand by
                                them in demanding a full investigation, impartial justice, and
                                determined punishment of the guilty.</p>
                            <p>Let this be done; then let them make good the losses of their own
                                people, contrary to treaty stipulations, simply for being followers
                                of the Saviour; let them replace our chapels with their own hands,
                                or pay their full value, as we may prefer, which I believe to be but
                                just in the circumstances, and I think the ends of peace and safety
                                will be gained, and the way opened for the more speedy extension of
                                the truth.</p>
                            <p>I have the honor to be, sir, yours, obediently,</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Sir:</hi> Among the many reports now in
                                circulation, one came to my knowledge, a day or two ago, which seems
                                to me worthy of attention. My informant, I may say, is an
                                intelligent person, who formerly occupied the position of city
                                magistrate in Spansi. For some months back he has been attending my
                                chapels in the city, and expressed a conviction of the truth of what
                                we teach some time previous to the recent outbreak. He is in no way
                                connected with us, however, and still visits, as before, among his
                                former official friends, and may be supposed to know something of
                                their views and feelings. His manner impressed me from the first as
                                being that of an honest Chinaman, and I have reason to believe he
                                expressed his honest convictions, and desires our welfare. Time will
                                show whether his views are just. He confirms a statement I heard, a
                                few days since, that Li-Hung-Chang is on his way here with some
                                13,000 troops; the van of this army has arrived already. Li is
                                simply a military mandarin, and his presence is only wanted where
                                there is, or is to be, fighting. So say others. He says, further,
                                that the government does not wish to go to war; that it is willing
                                to execute any number of the “<hi rend="italic">roughs</hi>,” and
                                banish the officials whose heads have been demanded by his
                                excellency Count Rochechouart; but they cannot be executed according
                                to Chinese law: hence, as a last resort, in view of this demand, war
                                is determined on. The people demand it, without a thought of the
                                final result, They think they can easily expel or kill the few
                                foreigners in China, especially in the north, and their work is
                                done. Hence, an imperial decree has gone forth for preparations for
                                a general rising against foreigners. He firmly believes it will take
                                place; at any rate, he knows of extensive preparations making here,
                                which will burst upon us as suddenly as the events of the 21st of
                                June. No reference is made to the French, <hi rend="italic">as
                                    such,</hi> but to foreigners. He is earnest in pressing his
                                advice that the missionaries leave <hi rend="italic">at once</hi>,
                                as the danger is increasing daily, and the crisis is near at hand,
                                viz., August 21 and 22. He expresses great surprise at the apparent
                                indifference of foreigners, when such a crisis is on us, in not
                                collecting a large force of troops here. He says the Chinese force
                                numbers some 40,000 or 50,000 troops, and that the preparations are
                                very extensive; these complete, and the attack begins without
                                warning.</p>
                            <p>All the above is confirmed by a school teacher, who came to see me
                                last evening, to give warning and offer any assistance in his power.
                                He has been a frequent attendant at my chapel for months. He also
                                speaks of one Ting I (or Jim) Chang, brother of the present Toutai
                                of Tien-tsin, who is on his way here, with a large body of men, from
                                Kiang Su. This is confirmed by a native Christian, just in from the
                                country, who reported the same to me this morning. He also urges us
                                to leave. As regards preparations, the suddenness of the attack, the
                                time, and the universality as regards foreigners, all accounts
                                agree.</p>
                            <p>Remembering the skepticism with which all reports were received
                                previous to the massacre, reports even less definite than we are now
                                receiving, and the final result, I would suggest, if I may be so
                                bold, the propriety of a constant watch being kept at points exposed
                                and good for observation. Precautionary measures are never out of
                                place, and may save foreigners’ lives.</p>
                            <p>I have the honor, &amp;c., &amp;c.,</p>

                            <p>The following correspondence has passed between her Britannic
                                Majesty’s consul and Messrs. Lees and Hall, regarding the damage

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have been requested by her Britannic
                                Majesty’s chargé d’affaires to ascertain the amount of damage
                                sustained by British subjects during the late unfortunate
                                troubles.</p>
                            <p>As I am aware that many of your chapels were destroyed, and much
                                valuable property lost, I have to request you, if you see fit, to
                                have estimates made of the losses, and send them to me, in order
                                that they may be forwarded to the Chinese authorities.</p>
                            <p>Your obedient servant,</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: We have the honor to acknowledge the
                                receipt of your official letter to us, dated the 20th instant,
                                touching the losses sustained by missions we represent during the
                                recent outrages.</p>
                            <p>We cannot but express our surprise, not only that, at this early
                                stage, we should be required to state the amount of those losses,
                                but that, prior to the settlement of the more important questions
                                which are still pending, the subject of monetary compensation should
                                be entertained at all.</p>
                            <p>Apart altogether from the fact that we are yet uncertain as to the
                                action which will be taken at the present crisis almost certainly by
                                the French, and, possibly, even by our own government—action which
                                it might be as useless as it would be impolitic for us to forestall,
                                by consenting to any unsatisfactory condonation of the crimes which
                                have been committed; it can hardly be necessary to remind you that,
                                until peace has been definitely secured, there are various items of
                                loss for which we should feel it to be our duty to claim
                                compensation, the limits of which can hardly yet have been reached,
                                Such is the utter disorganization of this city and neighborhood that
                                all mission work must, in all likelihood, be suspended for months to
                                come. Our respective staffs are thus thrown upon our hands. Our
                                country converts, both in this province and in Shantung, are every
                                where expecting new outbreaks in their various districts. Native
                                Christians in the city continue to be daily exposed to spoliation
                                and personal injury, while there is every reason to fear that our
                                own appearance in the streets would still be fraught with
                                danger.</p>
                            <p>With respect to our chapels, we fear that, however willing we might
                                be to meet the wishes of his excellency, it is not possible for us
                                to do so. Our converts hardly dare linger in the neighborhood of the
                                ruins; what hope can there be, then, that we can visit them in
                                safety, or procure builders’ estimates as to the cost of reërection,
                                not to speak of any actual attempt at restoration? Our deliberate
                                conviction is that such an attempt would only end in their renewed
                                destruction, even if workmen could be found brave enough to
                                undertake the task.</p>
                            <p>Will you forgive our expressing an anxious desire not to be separated
                                from our suffering French brethren in any settlement of these
                                unhappy troubles? This is not a mere question of sentiment. We
                                cannot but feel that the interests of our country are involved in
                                what has occurred. We are British subjects, resident here under the
                                protection of treaties, and engaged in the prudent prosecution of
                                our lawful calling. Our lives have been sought, our property has
                                been destroyed, our converts grievously injured, and our characters
                                assailed. Moreover, there seems good reason to believe that at
                                least, one of the murdered Sisters was a British subject. There
                                cannot be the slightest doubt upon the mind of any one who has been
                                brought much info converse with the people during the last few
                                weeks, that the original design was to treat all nationalities
                                alike. It is easy to understand why the mandarins are now anxious to
                                produce a different impression. But just as the excuses, which
                                unhappily served them so well in regard to the outrages at Formosa,
                                Yang-chow, and elsewhere, fail them now, so should the evident
                                falsity of their present professions of special friendship with
                                ourselves fail to separate us from those allies with whose interests
                                our own are so evidently bound up.</p>
                            <p>We beg you will not mistake us. We are not crying for war and
                                vengeance, but we do claim justice, and we hold most firmly to the
                                belief that the path of safety and of honor, no less for individual
                                Englishmen than for our government, is to stand by our
                                fellow-sufferers in the hour of trial. Nay, more, we believe this,
                                for obvious reasons, to be the most merciful line of action in
                                reference to the Chinese themselves.</p>
                            <p>We scarcely know whether we ought to apologize for venturing to
                                express such <pb n="377" xml:id="pg_377" facs="0411"/>views, for we
                                hope that they find an echo in your own and every other heart. We
                                have only, therefore, respectfully to assure you that we shall
                                strive to meet, as soon as possible, the wishes of her Britannic
                                Majesty’s chargé d’affaires, and to request you to represent to him
                                our difficulties in the matter.</p>
                            <p>We are, sir, your most obedient servants,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In my dispatch, No. 18, I reported to you
                            that the French chargé d’affaires was in Tien-tsin, where he had gone to
                            attend to the interment of the unfortunate victims of the late riot;
                            that a large naval force had collected at Tien-tsin and its vicinity;
                            that the French admiral was expected to meet the chargé at that place;
                            and that affairs generally looked troubled; I also stated that
                            instructions were daily expected from France by telegraph, via Russia,
                            indicating the reparation which would be demanded for the outrages of
                            the 21st June; and that until such instructions should arrive, no
                            specific demands would be made on the Chinese, and consequently all
                            speculation would be at fault in forecasting the result.</p>
                        <p>A few days after the arrival of Count Rochechouart at Tien-tsin, the
                            legations here were surprised to learn through the Chinese officials
                            that he had demanded the punishment (decapitation) of the two local
                            officials who were suspected of complicity in the riot, for he had
                            investigated the matter and satisfied himself of their guilt, and that
                            if condign punishment was not meted out, without delay, he should feel
                            himself at liberty to withdraw his legation and the French subjects
                            front Pekin, turning the whole matter over to the admiral, who would
                            take such action as he deemed necessary to enforce the demand and
                            maintain the honor of France.</p>
                        <p>The government notified the other foreign ministers of this demand, and
                            intimated that it would not be complied with; but said that the
                            officials referred to had been deprived of office, degraded from their
                            rank, and handed over to the board of punishments for trial, and if
                            found guilty would be punished with extreme rigor. Further than this
                            they could not and would not go, and if war was the alternative, it must
                            be accepted as the inevitable result. I presume that this answer was
                            communicated officially to M. Rochechouart, but am not sure. It is
                            believed that Admiral Dupré refused, in the absence of specific
                            instructions from his government, to enforce the demand, and perhaps the
                            news that hostilities were imminent between France and North Germany
                            caused the French naval officers to be more cautious than they otherwise
                            would. The French chargé denies having received any instructions; and it
                            is likely that the preparations for war in Europe have absorbed the
                            entire attention of the French government, so that this affair is lost
                            sight of for the moment; consequently, thus far, nothing <pb n="378"
                                xml:id="pg_378" facs="0412"/>has been done. M. Rochechouart has
                            returned to Pekin, and the whole matter is in abeyance.</p>
                        <p>The situation is much less satisfactory than it was a month ago. The
                            Chinese government then appeared willing to accede to any reasonable
                            demands for redress; now they seem indisposed to adopt any active
                            measures. Undoubtedly the news of hostilities in Europe leads them to
                            believe that there is small probability of France being able to commence
                            offensive operations this autumn, and the rigors of a northern winter
                            will delay all action until next summer.</p>
                        <p rend="center">* * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>No more favorable opportunity could have occurred to carry out the
                            principles of the coöperative policy than the present, and by a united
                            movement, by which I think all other foreign representatives would have
                            strengthened the hands of the French chargé, this vacillating and weak
                            government would probably have been brought to take a decided course of
                            action toward their own subjects, and made the stronger for feeling that
                            they had the moral aid and sanction of all treaty powers in dealing with
                            a most difficult and serious matter. Whether the result would have been
                            acceptable to all, or equal to my wishes in avoiding a war, may be
                            doubted; but the prospect of keeping that influence with Prince Kung and
                            his associates, which this united action would have brought about, has
                            been very greatly weakened.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> Since the late riot at Tien-tsin much
                            speculation has been indulged in as to the causes, and much pains have
                            been taken to ascertain the fact whether it was local in its origin or
                            whether it was a part of a wide-spread conspiracy.</p>
                        <p>Most foreigners at the ports were quite willing to accept the latter
                            view, and the newspapers, so far as I have seen, adopted the same
                            theory. The columns of the press during the past two months have teemed
                            with editorials and correspondence which, if true, would justify every
                            foreigner in departing the country instanter, without standing upon the
                            order of his going.</p>
                        <p>The measures of redress advocated by the people and the press have been
                            extravagant, unreasonable, and in most cases impracticable. All sorts of
                            measures of retaliation have been proposed; scarcely any proposing
                            anything less than the opening up, by force, of the whole empire to
                            foreign intercourse; and from that up to the decapitation of all the
                            government officials, the overthrow of the present government, and
                            placing the country under a foreign protectorate.</p>
                        <p>My opinion from the first has been that the disturbance was local,
                            confined to Tien-tsin and its vicinity. I do not believe there was any
                            knowledge of the intended riot among the natives in this city, eighty
                            miles distant. All the testimony that comes to me from reliable sources
                            only confirms the opinion I had formed. The danger that I apprehended
                            was the effect the news of the riot would have upon the inhabitants at
                                <pb n="379" xml:id="pg_379" facs="0413"/>points distant from the
                            scene of the disaster. It seemed altogether likely that the Chinese
                            would, as a matter of course, believe the tales of their own countrymen
                            as to the moving causes, and justify the retribution which had befallen
                            the Catholics for their alleged evil practices. To counteract the effect
                            elsewhere it seemed to me important that an official denial, emanating
                            from the highest authority, should be given to the truth of the stories
                            that had been circulated in regard to kidnapping and its attendant
                            cruelties, and that the authors of, and the aiders and abettors in, the
                            riots should be promptly and severely punished.</p>
                        <p>I have received very interesting and instructive letters from the
                            vice-consul at Swatow, bearing upon this subject, a copy of which I beg
                            to inclose, (inclosure A.) From this statement it is apparent that
                            nothing was known there of the riot prior toits occurrence. A similar
                            statement comes to me from the consul at Neuchwang, a port much nearer
                            to Tien-tsin than Swatow. In both places, however, the effect of the
                            news was to create excitement among the people. Full faith and credit
                            were given to the reports of kidnapping, and but little disguise was
                            apparent among the people generally, in expressing their approval of the
                            retaliatory measures.</p>
                        <p>The consul at Swatow, you will observe, expresses the opinion that
                            punishment of the guilty, without an official denial of the truth of the
                            reports that incited the mob, would be of little avail in quieting the
                            people. Unless this was done the people would still believe that
                            punishment had been inflicted in obedience to the demands of foreigners,
                            and not to satisfy offended justice. The language of the Chinaman, “It
                            will be hard to be right and have to suffer also,” expresses the whole
                            idea.</p>
                        <p>In view of this popular feeling the imperial decree, a translation of
                            which I inclose, (inclosure B,) is an important document, and will, I
                            trust, be productive of good. It is not as clear and explicit as I could
                            have wished, but it is all that can reasonably be expected from
                            officials trained as they have been, and harboring superstitions that
                            would have been considered radical in the days of Salem witchcraft.</p>
                        <p>Inclosure C is a translation of the offensive proclamation which the
                            prefect of Tien-tsin put forth about the 10th of June, which it is
                            believed was mainly instrumental in stirring up the people. It is
                            certainly a very offensive document, and well calculated to produce the
                            terrible result which followed.</p>
                        <p>Inclosure D is a translation of a decree ordering the two suspended
                            magistrates back to Tien-tsin for the convenience of examination. These
                            are the two officials whose summary punishment the French chargé
                            demanded.</p>
                        <p>I regret to be compelled to say that the delay of the officials in this
                            whole matter argues ill for the future. At first they appeared to be
                            greatly alarmed, and anxious to get advice from the foreign diplomatic
                            representatives as to their proper course, in order to do justice and
                            avoid a hostile demonstration on the part of the French. Latterly this
                            feeling has given way to one of coolness bordering upon indifference.
                            This change is attributable partly to the action of the French chargé as
                            detailed in my No. 24, and the knowledge that France is engaged in
                            hostilities at home, and partly to the practical difficulties in the way
                            of ascertaining and bringing to justice the criminals in Tien-tsin,
                            against the public opinion of the entire population of the city. These
                            causes are likely to defeat the well-intentioned plans and purposes of
                            the officials, formed in the beginning; and things will be likely to
                            drift along until France gets ready to apply force to compel a
                            settlement.</p>
                        <pb n="380" xml:id="pg_380" facs="0414"/>
                        <p>Fans are now being manufactured and sold in Tien-tsin, having coarsely
                            engraved views of the burning buildings and the murdering of the people
                            in the streets upon them. Fans to the Chinese are what illustrated
                            papers are to the people of the United States. They are made to suit the
                            tastes of the people, and the fact that such engravings will cause a
                            better sale for the fans is a conclusive argument that there is no
                            sentiment of regret or sorrow among the people over the result of the
                            riot. There is undoubtedly greater unanimity of opinion there in favor
                            of the rioters than there is in Ireland among the peasantry in favor of
                            one of their number who shoots his landlord. If this feeling in Ireland
                            is strong enough to baffle all attempts of the English government to
                            bring to justice, by the ordinary forms of law, a peasant accused of
                            injuring the person or property of his landlord, is it surprising that
                            this feeble central government should find it difficult to ascertain and
                            punish the rioters in a city of 400,000 inhabitants, all of whom either
                            aided in the massacre or sympathize with the criminals?</p>
                        <p>It is this spirit among the people that portends evil; and I shall not be
                            surprised to hear of similar outbreaks elsewhere, unless a change in
                            feeling of the populace soon takes place. All the foreign
                            representatives here are doing what they can to secure action by the
                            government which will change the current of public sentiment, and
                            thereby add to the safety of their countrymen residing here. I shall
                            continue to urge upon the Chinese officials measures calculated to
                            promote the security and welfare of foreigners, and at the same time
                            insure peace and benefits to the people here, and stability to their
                            government. Further than this I do not feel at liberty to go, were I so
                            disposed, which I am not.</p>

                                excellency to learn the effect produced upon the Chinese mind in
                                distant ports by the news of the atrocity at Tien-tsin.</p>
                            <p>I have the honor, therefore, to communicate to you a digest of
                                observations thus far.</p>
                            <p>It is proper to remark, in the way of preface, that my opportunities
                                for learning speedily and correctly are full and reliable, for, in
                                connection with my missionary work, I have assistants stationed in
                                nearly all of the principal cities of the prefecture. In accordance
                                with an established usage, these assistants write to me in the early
                                part of every week. Their letters are concerned exclusively with
                                their legitimate work. They are not encouraged to allude to the
                                common gossip of the places where they are. It is only when
                                something stirs up unusual commotion that information on the subject
                                is communicated to me. The week subsequent to the dissemination of
                                the Tien-tsin intelligence, these letters of the assistants came to
                                me freighted with the same stories of what was being said among the
                                Chinese. It is impossible that they could have communication with
                                each other. The letters are therefore independent sources of
                                information, and mutually corroborate each other. Besides the above,
                                I have myself taken special pains to ascertain, by personal converse
                                with persons, the movements of popular feeling, and can therefore
                                make my statements with confidence.</p>
                            <p>After the exercise of a due discrimination between what is local and
                                what is general, what is rumor and what is substantial, I find
                                myself in possession of information that may be comprised in the
                                following points:</p>
                            <p>1st. Within a week after the first receipt of the news here it was
                                well known in all the towns and cities in this department. There
                                have been three distinct sources of information: 1st. Intelligence
                                contained in the Hong-Kong papers; 2d. Numerous letters received by
                                the Chinese from Hong-Kong, from Shanghai, and from Tien-tsin; many
                                Chinese from this region in those places in the prosecution of
                                business; and, 3d. Verbal information given at various Yamêns to
                                those who inquire.</p>
                            <p>2d. In every instance the Chinese version of the affair has received
                                credence. With alight variation, the story given out has been that
                                foreigners have been kidnapping <pb n="381" xml:id="pg_381"
                                    facs="0415"/>children for the most horrible purposes; that a
                                mandarin went to the Roman Catholic hospital to remonstrate; that he
                                was set upon by the priests and killed, or, as some say, fired upon;
                                that this was more than the people could bear, and then they rose
                                for self-protection; that in the collision which ensued, many
                                Chinese were killed and many foreigners also.</p>
                            <p>3d. A bitter, malicious rancor toward foreigners suddenly developed
                                itself. Some of this feeling was the natural result of faith in the
                                stories about kidnapping. But it would be a delusion to ascribe it
                                all to that source. It was plain that a long-cherished but
                                suppressed ill-will was taking occasion to assert itself. Truth
                                requires me to state that the general feeling about the massacre was
                                gratulation, amounting in some instances to gloating. Persons
                                connected with us have been threatened, and told that the time for
                                the destruction of the rest of us would come by-and-by. In the first
                                frenzy of the excitement, the soldiers under Pong-ta-yeh assaulted
                                and partially destroyed several houses connected with the English
                                Presbyterian mission. However, on complaint being made, the officer
                                in charge caused some of the ringleaders to be punished, but
                                declined the responsibility of making restitution. One of my own
                                assistants, for expressing abhorrence of the treatment of the
                                Sisters of Charity, was assaulted and beaten, and threatened with
                                death by a squad of soldiers under the command of a petty officer
                                traveling with him at the time on the same passage boat.</p>
                            <p>4th. The first imperial edict, made in reply to the memorial of
                                Chunghow, and directing inquiry into the truth of the kidnapping
                                story, and also after the originators of the disturbance, became
                                known here about a week after the first news of the massacre. It
                                produced a manifest effect in making people more cautious in
                                expressing themselves. But, unfortunately, the effect is to confirm
                                the mass in opinion that the enormities attributed to the Sisters of
                                Charity were actually perpetrated, and, as the charge remains
                                uncontradicted, the bitter feeling, though smothered a little,
                                remains in force unabated. The extinction of the false impression is
                                a matter of importance to us, even at this remote distance. This can
                                be done effectually only through an imperial edict declaring the
                                falsity of the charges, after a full investigation has been held.
                                Any action taken by the French government which does not involve
                                such a declaration from the throne will leave the adjustment of the
                                difficulty incomplete. I say this for the reason that Chinese of
                                standing and intelligence have told me the mass of the people do
                                believe their own mandarin was assaulted while in the discharge of a
                                legitimate, though disagreeable, duty, and “that it will be hard to
                                bear to be in the right and have to suffer for it also.” The truth
                                should therefore be fully set forth, and then subsequent measures
                                will have their proper moral effect. It is to be feared that a
                                commission, composed exclusively of high Chinese officials, without
                                any foreigners, will fail to present the truth, and we shall suffer
                                in consequence, in the general estimation.</p>
                            <p>5th. I am told by numbers of Chinese of respectability that upon the
                                mode of settlement of the Tien-tsin difficulty depends the security
                                of our future relations. There has been an opinion gaining ground
                                here for years, and I speak now from personal knowledge, that a time
                                was coming when a different tone should be used toward foreigners,
                                which would be sustained by force if necessary. Such a sentiment in
                                the territory adjacent to a small port is of itself no great moment,
                                save as the constant iteration of it prepares the mind of the people
                                for making the trouble they predict. Now that the massacre of the
                                north has occurred, there has been excited and intense desire to see
                                how it will end. It is plain the Chinese in this region will be
                                influenced by it, for good or for evil, to annoy and hamper us, or
                                allow us the quiet enjoyment of treaty life.</p>

                                for foreign affairs, herewith makes a communication.</p>
                            <p>Two days since, I was honored by receiving the following imperial
                                decrees:</p>
                            <p>“Tsang Kwoh-fan and Tsanghow have sent up the following memorial,
                                wherein they give the result of their inquiry into the riot at
                                Tien-tsin and its attendant cireumstances:</p>
                            <p>“‘We have thoroughly examined into the charges brought against the
                                Roman Catholics of having bewitched and carried off people, and find
                                that there is no reliable evidence that the missionaries had
                                anything to do with it; for Wang-sun, who at first confessed that he
                                had given drugs to Wu Lan-chin, afterward retracted all he had <pb
                                    n="382" xml:id="pg_382" facs="0416"/>said, and their depositions
                                did not agree; further, the boys and girls taken from the hospital
                                of the Sisters of Charity, more than 150 altogether, all declare
                                that they were brought to the place by their relatives and not one
                                among them had been kidnapped.</p>
                            <p>“‘When Tsang Kwoh-fan first reached Tien-tsin, he personally made
                                inquiries and fully questioned people about the accusations of
                                taking out eyes and opening hearts, but not one of them could bring
                                forward a single actual case; nor had any family in or around the
                                city of Tien-tsin complained in the courts of having lost children.
                                The incidents closely resemble those in the provinces of Kianasi and
                                Hunan in the cities of Yang-chau and Tienmân, and in Ta-ming and
                                Kwangping, in this province (of Chihli,) all of which were caused by
                                anonymous inflammatory placards and exciting talk by which people’s
                                minds were distracted. Although these cases were all satisfactorily
                                settled, the truth or falsity of these rumors and placards was never
                                fully investigated and made generally known; while the people of
                                Tien-tsin were continually hearing of them and fully believed them
                                to be true.</p>
                            <p>“‘Moreover, owing to the practice of these foreign Roman Catholic
                                mission establishments to close their doors thoughout the year; and
                                to the existence of cellars under the mission-house and the hospital
                                of the Sisters of Charity, dug to contain coal and prevent dampness,
                                and to the rule that persons under medical treatment are not allowed
                                to go out; and lastly that many of the poor homeless wretches taken
                                in for relief were at the point of death, (and suffered great
                                mortality,) it came to pass that the popular suspicions were all
                                strengthened and not dissipated.</p>
                            <p>“‘During the months of May and June it happened that some kidnappers,
                                who had used drugs to bewitch people, were arrested and charged the
                                Roman Catholics with participation in their doings. [On the day] the
                                populace saw M. Fontanier, the consul, fire his pistol at the
                                officers, and immediately raising a great cry throughout their
                                ranks, at once ran together, crying out, this is the one who takes
                                out the eyes and hearts and cuts up human beings; words that were
                                mostly wild rumors, without a shadow of evidence to support
                                them.’</p>
                            <p>“The orders which were sent to Tsang Kwoh-fan and Tsanghow to jointly
                                manage this affair with fairness, have now brought out this report,
                                showing that the whole disturbance arose from unfounded rumors which
                                excited the suspicions of the people at Tien-tsin. This is plainly
                                to be seen. If the same rumors prevail in other provinces they will
                                give rise to endless suspicions which should be dissipated. It is to
                                be feared, however, that the strict laws relating to the bewitching
                                and carrying off of children and people have gradually come to be
                                regarded as a dead letter; and the board of punishments is therefore
                                ordered, wherever cases of this kind are brought before it, to
                                inflict even additional punishment on the guilty. The authorities in
                                the provinces will follow the decisions of the board of punishments
                                in dealing with all persons convicted of these crimes and execute
                                strict justice, that the wicked and cruel may be deterred from
                                similar doings.</p>
                            <p>“Pekin itself, being the head of the empire, (<hi rend="italic"
                                    >lit.,</hi> the place of the head of goodness,) must still more
                                be carefully cleared of such miscreants. Let the commandant of the
                                metropolitan guard therefore institute strict search, and let all
                                kidnappers who are taken up be immediately delivered to the hoard of
                                punishments for trial and condign punishment. Respect this.”</p>
                            <p>In addition to the preceding, I have received the following
                                decree:</p>
                            <p>“Tsang Kwoh-fan having reported that Chang Kwang-tsao, the prefect of
                                Tien-tsin, and Liu Kieh, the district magistrate, had so acted as to
                                excite a riot between the people and the Roman Catholics, and been
                                very remiss in taking precautions before it occurred, and since then
                                have been unable to arrest the criminals quickly, requests that they
                                be degraded from their posts and handed over for trial and
                                punishment. Let these two officers, therefore, be instantly deprived
                                of their rank and delivered to the board of punishments to be dealt
                                with. Respect this.”</p>
                            <p>I have now the honor to send you copies (of these two decrees) for
                                your excellency’s information.</p>

                                respecting measures to be taken to arrest [kidnappers.]</p>
                            <p>On the 6th of June the constable of Yung-fung-tien (a village near
                                Tien-tsin) seized and brought to this office two men named Chang and
                                Kwoh, who had been arrested for stupefying and bewitching a lad
                                named Li Ta-yang, in the district of Tsinghai, and carrying him off.
                                On examination they confessed that they had used certain drugs, and
                                recited incantations in order to bewitch children to follow them.
                                They were accordingly <pb n="383" xml:id="pg_383" facs="0417"
                                />ordered to be executed in that, district where the crime was
                                committed, in accordance with directions received from the higher
                                courts.</p>
                            <p>Rumors have been circulated that these villains had carried on their
                                practices by direction of certain persons, and had gone about the
                                country to bewitch and kidnap children in order to take out their
                                brains, eyes, and hearts, to be used in preparing certain medicines.
                                Detestable in the extreme! If instant measures are not taken to
                                visit such things with condign punishment, how can the villagers be
                                quieted, or the laws of the land vindicated? And the magistrate of
                                Tien tsin has sent out his policemen, and issued orders for them to
                                arrest such men. But as Tien-tsin is a large city, containing a
                                dense population, and the district is a wide region, it is really to
                                be feared that these miscreants will not give up their practices,
                                but will steal into its purlieus and hide themselves in
                                out-of-the-way places where they cannot be pursued, thence to watch
                                their chance to conjure away ignorant and simple children. If such
                                fellows are not sharply followed up and seized, how can these
                                inhuman deeds be stopped and the country quieted? Competent
                                detectives have therefore been appointed to follow up and arrest
                                them, to notify which is the object of this proclamation.</p>

                                for foreign affairs, herewith makes a communication.</p>
                            <p>On the 7th instant I received the following imperial decree:</p>
                            <p>“Chang Kwang-tsao, the prefect of Tien-tsin, and Liu Kieh, the
                                district magistrate, both of whom have been degraded, were reported
                                by Tsang Kwoh-fan, and have been handed over to the board for trial
                                and punishment. These degraded officers ought properly to be
                                examined where their offense was committed; and at Tien-tsin,
                                personal depositions can be taken, and the accused confronted with
                                witness, which will enable the board of punishments to examine awl
                                decide their eases equitably and intelligently. Let Tsien Ting-ming
                                immediately semi them to Tien-tsin in charge of a special officer,
                                who will wait with them till their depositions and cross-examination
                                are finished. Respect this.”</p>
                            <p>It appears to me that as the riot in which these officers are
                                involved occurred at Tien-tsin, it will be much easier to
                                cross-examine and get the real facts there; and I have accordingly
                                transmitted the above decree, requiring that the degraded prefect
                                and magistrate give their evidence and be cross-examined before
                                witness at Tien-tsin, preparatory to their being again delivered to
                                the board of punishments for final sentence, to his excelleney
                                Tsang, cabinet minister and governor general of Chihli, to act in
                                conformity thereto, and the object of this dispatch is to inform
                                your excellency of what has been done in this respect.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have the honor to inform you that, in
                            consequence of rumors of threatened violence by the Chinese, and a
                            general belief that an organized attack would be made upon them on the
                            15th of the 8th moon, (September 10,) the missionaries residing at
                            Tungchow, about forty miles from Chefoo, in the province of Shantung,
                            determined to remove, with their families, to Chefoo for safety. The
                            correspondence, copies of which I beg to inclose, will give you all the
                            information that I possess.</p>
                        <p>The only direct, information is contained in the letter of the Rev. <hi
                                rend="smallcaps">M</hi>r<hi rend="smallcaps">. C</hi>app; for the
                            rest I am indebted to the courtesy of the British chargé <pb n="384"
                                xml:id="pg_384" facs="0418"/>d’affaires, who kindly allowed me to
                            read and take copies of the report, with its inclosures, of the British
                            acting consul at Chefoo. Up to the present moment I have heard nothing
                            from the United States vice-consul.</p>
                        <p>I am quite free to admit that I was exceedingly vexed and mortified on
                            learning that the services of British vessels had been sought to remove
                            these people, when there was a United States gunboat at Tien-tsin that
                            could have gone to their relief in three or four days; and also in being
                            obliged to seek information as to what had been done through the British
                            legation, when reports from the United States vice-consul should have
                            been made to me without delay.</p>
                        <p>Were there an American resident at Chefoo who would accept the position,
                            I should be strongly inclined to advise the summary removal of Mr.
                            Holmes, and the appointment of a better man. Unfortunately there are no
                            persons resident there fitted for the position who will accept it for
                            the emoluments, and I suppose the reputation of the United States must
                            continue to suffer from such representatives as the vice-consul at
                            Chefoo.</p>
                        <p>Prior to the receipt of the news of their removal, the missionaries had
                            made no complaint, nor had I heard from them or the vice-consul at
                            Chefoo that any trouble was apprehended. From all that I am able to
                            learn I cannot but think the missionaries were unduly alarmed and their
                            action precipitate; at the same time the public mind is so much excited
                            by rumors, the truth of which is so difficult to ascertain from the
                            Chinese, that even the coolest and most courageous among the foreigners
                            are liable to over-estimate the danger, and adopt measures for
                            protection which they afterward ascertain were unnecessary.</p>
                        <p>In reply to Mr. Capp’s letter to me, I have advised them to return as
                            soon as they can feel any safety in so doing; and, as it would have a
                            good moral effect, I shall try to have them go back on one of our
                            vessels of war. The Monocacy is expected at Chefoo shortly—as soon,
                            probably, as they will be ready.</p>
                        <p>I have written a strong note to the prince, informing him of the
                            unsettled state of affairs at Tungchow, and asking him to take measures
                            for the protection of foreign residents; and have improved the occasion
                            to review the Tien-tsin affair, charging the troubles elsewhere to the
                            evil effects of the news of the riot. No answer has been received as
                            yet. As soon as a reply comes I will send you a copy of my note and the
                            prince’s response.</p>
                        <p>The proclamations of the local officials at Tungchow are timely, strongly
                            put, and, I hope, will do good.</p>
                        <p>Acting Consul Mayers, in his report to the British chargé d’affaires,
                            expresses my views so well concerning this whole affair that I quote
                            from his report:</p>
                        <p>The resident missionaries are, it may be presumed, the best judges with
                            regard to the steps it behooved them to take in view of their feeling of
                            insecurity and the known faithlessness of Chinese officials, but I
                            cannot repress a feeling of regret that so much encouragement has been
                            given to the anti-foreign party as the withdrawal from Tungchow will, I
                            conceive, result in. I am apprehensive that their departure will not
                            only produce a profound impression locally, but, being reported and
                            exaggerated in distant parts of the country, may be expected to embolden
                            the hostile spirit which appears to have grown up of late.</p>
                        <p>If the Chinese find that the missionaries can be induced to abandon their
                            posts of duty by threats of violence, they will, very soon, constitute a
                            repulsed army retreating in the face of the enemy.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> Permit us to submit to your
                                consideration the following: At Tungchow, in the province of
                                Shautung, the reports that had been circulating for months of an
                                intended attack upon the foreigners residing there and the natives
                                attached to them, became so definite and apparently well-founded
                                that we could no longer ignore them.</p>
                            <p>At a meeting of the foreign community, who are all American citizens,
                                held August 29, it was decided that we should temporarily leave the
                                place. We accordingly addressed a note (a copy of which, marked A,
                                we inclose) to Mr. Holmes, the American consul at Chefoo. In the
                                absence of an American gun-boat he made application to his
                                excellency Vice-Admiral Sir Henry Kellett. K. C. B., her Britannic
                                Majesty’s naval, commander-in-chief, who, with great kindness, sent
                                the Barossa and the Grasshopper to our assistance, and secured our
                                safe departure on Thursday, September 1st, instant.</p>
                            <p>We have written to Sir Henry Kellett the note a copy of which, marked
                                B, we inclose, in acknowledgment of his kindness.</p>
                            <p>Before our departure, in interviews with the local officers, we could
                                obtain no guarantee for the safety of our lives and property.</p>
                            <p>Within twenty-four hours, however, after our arrival at Chefoo, the
                                Chi-hien (district magistrate) of Tungchow reported the fact of our
                                leaving to the Tao-tai at Chefoo, who, in a communication to the
                                American consul, deprecates our departure, and cordially invites our
                                immediate return.</p>
                            <p>We beg leave to bring these statements to your notice, and would
                                consider it a great favor if you will kindly give us your judgment
                                as to the course of conduct proper for us to pursue under the
                                circumstances.</p>
                            <p>We are, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servants,</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Sir: I</hi> am requested, by a unanimous
                                vote of the American residents here to write to you on their behalf
                                to request you to obtain a steamer, a gunboat if possible, to come
                                to Tungchow Thursday morning of this week to remove us from this
                                place. The reason for this action I will give below.</p>
                            <p>We have credible grounds for believing that official communications
                                were received here some time back from Tsing-quo-fan, and from the
                                governor of the province, calling upon the authorities and the
                                people to make arrangements for massacring foreigners generally some
                                time this fall. It is believed here that Chi-hien, and the principal
                                military officers who were summoned to the provincial capital some
                                weeks ago, went for the express purpose of being instructed as to
                                what they should do with us, and as to the preparation they should
                                make for defending the city in case of war.</p>
                            <p>The Chi-hien came back from Chi-naw-foo last week, went on to Chefoo
                                immediately to communicate with the Taotai, and has returned to
                                Tungchow. The chief military mandarin of this city is expected here
                                three days hence, and it is said that he is bringing <pb n="386"
                                    xml:id="pg_386" facs="0420"/>2,000 soldiers with hire. Some
                                reportsstate that in the event [of the punishment] of the Chinese in
                                Tient-sin, they will take their revenge on us here—others, that they
                                will hold ns as hostages.</p>
                            <p>We hear that a very large military force is being collected in
                                Chi-naw-foo. There is a great deal of excitement here again, and
                                since the return of the Chi-hien the principal men of the city are
                                holding frequent conferences with the officers.</p>
                            <p>We have learned from independent sources that the people are
                                divided—some of them opposing any movement against us, and some of
                                them favoring it. The people generally expect that an attack will be
                                made upon us on the 16th of the present Chinese month. We have
                                received intelligence from our native Christians in Ping-tai and
                                Lai-yung, confirming these reports. Chinese connected with us are
                                urged by their Mends to get away from us by all means before the
                                15th, and there is reason to anticipate that they may be obliged to
                                do so in order to save their lives, if we remain here longer. It is
                                very probable that it will be impossible to leave Tungchow if we
                                delay long. We think that even now we would find it difficult in
                                getting away by the ordinary modes of travel. I might refer to other
                                rumors had I time and were it necessary.</p>
                            <p>It is with great reluctance that we have determined to send you this
                                communication, but under the circumstances we think the risk too
                                great to remain longer. Our plan is to leave our houses in the care
                                of the officers. We would be glad to have you come as an official
                                representative in communicating with them. We will be ready to leave
                                early Thursday morning. If no gunboat or steamer can be obtained we
                                would be greatly obliged if Mr. Mayers will fulfill the promise he
                                has already made, to come to us in his boat. Perhaps two boats would
                                be required. There are here five gentlemen, five ladies, and eight
                                children, and we would like to take with us a few Chinese.</p>
                            <p>If a steamer cannot come to us on Thursday, please communicate with
                                us at the earliest moment by special post.</p>
                            <p>I am, sir, on behalf of the American residents here, yours,

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have the honor to report to you that
                                on the application of Mr. Holmes, the United States vice-consul at
                                this port, the American missionaries residing at Tungchow, forty
                                miles distant from Che Foo, were yesterday removed hither by her
                                Majesty’s ships Barossa and Grasshopper, at the urgent request of
                                the missionaries themselves.</p>
                            <p>I received a note late in the evening of Tuesday, the 30th August,
                                from Mr. Holmes, who inclosed to me a letter he had received from
                                Tungchow, and intimated his intention of soliciting assistance on
                                the following morning from Vice-Admiral Sir Henry Kellett.</p>
                            <p>Correspondence took place on the 31st between Mr. Holmes and the
                                admiral, who subsequently furnished me with copies of the four
                                letters mutually exchanged, transcripts of which I now inclose for
                                your information.</p>
                            <p>Having been requested by Admiral Kellett to call on the United States
                                vice-consul after the receipt of his first letter, I found Mr.
                                Holmes apparently sharing my own opinion, that the apprehensions of
                                the missionaries of official designs against them were exaggerated
                                and based on insufficient information, although excusable,
                                doubtless, in view of their exposed position, the prevailing popular
                                excitement, and the anti-foreign spirit evoked by the massacre at
                                Tien-tsin. The reasons given by the missionaries for deciding on
                                immediate removal are set forth in the letter from Mr. Nevins, which
                                is annexed to Mr. Holmes’s first letter to the admiral, in addition
                                to which Mr. Holmes further supplied me with a letter written at the
                                same time by the Rev. Mr. Capp to Mr. Corbett of this place, a copy
                                of which I also inclose herewith.</p>
                            <p>After seeing Sir Henry Kellett, I called, at his request, upon the
                                Taotai, whom I sounded in the course of the conversation, with
                                reference to the affairs at Tungchow. He professed surprise on
                                hearing that the missionaries were again disturbed by rumors of
                                hostile designs, which he treated with ridicule, and begged me to
                                take notice that he held himself personally responsible for complete
                                security of the missionaries. I expressed my satisfaction on hearing
                                these assurances from his lips, coupled with the further undertaking
                                which he volunteered, to write at once to his subordinates at
                                Tungchow to take measures for checking the spread of idle reports,
                                and for assuring the safety of the foreign denizens of the town. I
                                did not think it expedient to make known to him that they
                                contemplated immediate removal, as I was still uncertain whether
                                this would actually take place. I communicated to Mr. Holmes the
                                result of nay interview with the Taotai. In the course of the day
                                further letters came in from Tungchow, announcing the fixed
                                determination of the missionaries to leave the place at once, and
                                expressing continued alarm. I am permitted by Mr. Holwill, of the
                                customs, <pb n="387" xml:id="pg_387" facs="0421"/>to whom one of
                                these letters is addressed, to forward a copy to you, and I inclose
                                the same herewith.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Holmes thereupon addressed a positive application to Admiral
                                Kellett for the immediate dispatch of a vessel of war, and the
                                corvette Barrossa and gunboat Grasshopper were accordingly ordered
                                to proceed at daylight on the following morning to render assistance
                                as requested. Sir Henry Kellett being desirous that an interpreter
                                should accompany the commanding officer, to assist him in
                                communication if necessary with boat people or others near the
                                vessels, I directed Mr. Lolbe to proceed on this service, with
                                instructions, copy of which I inclose. The two vessels reached
                                Tungchow at about 11 a. m., and the embarcation of the missionaries
                                and their families was completed by 3 p. m., without any difficulty
                                or molestation on the part of the people. The number brought away
                                consisted of three men, five women, and five children, two of the
                                missionaries remaining behind to arrange, if possible, with the
                                local officials respecting the safe custody of their houses and
                                property.</p>
                            <p>The Rev. Mr. Nevins called upon me this morning, and explained to me
                                at some length the reasons which had actuated himself and his
                                colleagues in retiring from Tungchow. Without giving credence to the
                                numerous reports of malignant intentions toward the missionaries and
                                foreigners generally, which emanated, they are informed, from the
                                governor of the province, they nevertheless thought their position
                                so insecure as to leave them no option but to abandon it. The
                                circumstance giving the greatest cause for alarm, among the
                                multitude of minor incidents, was the reported approach of a
                                reinforcement of 2,000 men to the garrison of Tungchow, who were
                                said to be marching from the provincial capital.</p>
                            <p>It appears to have been openly stated throughout the city that the
                                foreigners would be murdered on the 10th of this month, (the 15th of
                                the 8th moon,) and it was thought that the constant repetition of
                                such a prediction, unhindered by the presence of any protective
                                force, might work its own fulfillment, through the excitement of the
                                masses, even if no such sinister design originally existed.</p>
                            <p>The resident missionaries are, it may be presumed, the best judges
                                with regard to the steps it behooves them to take in view of their
                                feeling of insecurity and the known faithlessness of the Chinese
                                officials, but I cannot repress a feeling of regret that so much
                                encouragement should have been given to the anti-foreign party as
                                this withdrawal from Tungchow will, I conceive, result in. I am
                                apprehensive that their departure will not only produce a profound
                                impression locally, but, being reported in an exaggerated form in
                                distant parts of the country, may be expected to embolden the
                                hostile spirit which appears to have grown up of late.</p>

                                for your perusal, a letter just received from Rev. J. L. Nevins, D.
                                D., residing at Tungchow, which will explain itself.</p>
                            <p>The news from there being of rather an alarming character, and the
                                people deeming it unsafe to remain there longer in the absence of an
                                American man-of-war, if it would not be asking too much, may I
                                request that your excellency will be kind enough to allow a gunboat
                                to go to their assistance, providing you consider it necessary. The
                                residents there, eighteen in number, men, women, and children, have
                                made arrangements, according to the letter herewith, to leave
                                to-morrow, the 1st September.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have the honor to acknowledge the
                                receipt of your dispatch of this date, inclosing a letter from the
                                Rev. Dr. Nevins, of Tungchow, representing that in consequence of
                                certain alarming reports the American missionaries are desirous of
                                removing <pb n="388" xml:id="pg_388" facs="0422"/>themselves and
                                their families to Che Foo, and requesting that if I consider it
                                necessary, as there is no United States vessel of war present, I
                                will send an English gunboat to bring them away.</p>
                            <p>In reply, I beg to point out to you that you, as the United States
                                consul, are the proper person to decide as to the necessity, on the
                                evidence before you, of removing the American citizens, but I need
                                not assure you that if I receive any requisition from you to afford
                                succor to them I would immediately comply with it if able.</p>
                            <p>Just at this moment, the only suitable vessel, the Grasshopper
                                gunboat, is under repair and unfit for sea; but I have reason to
                                believe that if, on reflection, you consider that assistance should
                                be sent to Dr. Nevins and his colleagues, an application made to the
                                proper authorities will result in the dispatch of the Chinese
                                gunboat, now in harbor, to Tungchow to bring them away.</p>
                            <p>My information leads to the opinion that the apprehensions of the
                                missionaries are greater than necessary, and it is worth bearing in
                                mind that their withdrawal simultaneously from Tungchow, which is
                                not a treaty port, and forsaking their houses and property, will
                                probably give them much embarrassment in the future, as opposition
                                will certainly be actively made to their return by the anti-foreign
                                party.</p>

                                dangerous to remain longer, and have decided to come away
                                immediately, I deem it necessary, from their statements, that succor
                                should be sent to enable them to get away; therefore, as the

                                learned before this reaches you that we are getting scared up in
                                Tungchow. I have not time to write you the particulars. They have
                                been written in full to the American consul. I am still, however,
                                inclined to think that we are worse scared than hurt. I believe
                                there is danger; but I doubt if it is great enough to justify us in
                                leaving. I have expressed my views to the others, but they carry it
                                against me, and of course I must act with the rest. I do not think I
                                am less sensible of the danger than the rest; but I am willing to
                                run greater risks for the sake of the interests that are at stake. I
                                have not yet made up my mind to go with the rest; but, of course, I
                                cannot tell till the time cornels. It is possible that the knowledge
                                of the fact that we are “mobilizing” may develop things that we are
                                not looking for. I hope that the steamer that comes will be prepared
                                to stay at least one day, as it will be impossible for us to settle
                                upon affairs with the mandarins (conveying our houses to them) in
                                less than at least one day. I have never taken a step in my life
                                that goes so against every principle of my nature. It is certainly
                                the greatest trial I ever met with. To know what it costs to leave
                                here one must have lived here for seven years, and labored as I
                                have. I am most disturbed for our school. I fear the disbanding of
                                it will be disastrous. I can only say God’s will be done. It may be
                                wise for us to leave, and it may be a piece of folly. I wish others
                                could have been persuaded to wait for a little more light. Pray for
                                us that we may be guided aright and preserved from all evil.</p>
                            <p>Yours fraternally,</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I beg to acknowledge the receipt of
                                your note of 20th instant, informing me of the withdrawal of all the
                                Protestant missionaries from Tungchow, and inclosing a copy of Rev.
                                Mr. Nevins’s letter to the United States vice-consul at Che Foo,
                                giving the reasons for this action. With these came also a copy of
                                your note to Admiral Kellett, thanking him for his humane and
                                generous action, in sending vessels to your relief.</p>
                            <p>In your note you refer to the “reports that had been circulating for
                                months of an intended attack,” and speak of interviews between the
                                missionaries and the local officials prior to the departure of the
                                former, in which they failed to obtain any guarantee for the safety
                                of their lives and property. You also state that soon after your
                                arrival in Che Foo, the United States vice-consul received a
                                communication from the Taotai, in which he deprecated your departure
                                and requested your immediate return to Tung-chow. You close by
                                asking my judgment as to your future course, in view of all these
                                considerations.</p>
                            <p>In reply, I have to say that prior to the receipt of your note, I had
                                no intimation of apprehended trouble at Tungchow. If the reports
                                referred to had been in circulation for months, it would seem that
                                some information should have been given to the vice-consul at Che
                                Foo or to me. If you did make any communication to the vice-consul
                                upon the subject, he failed to apprise me of the fact.</p>
                            <p>I regret that your appeals to the local officers for protection were
                                not made in writing, so I might have some tangible evidence of their
                                culpability in not affording protection, on which to base a
                                complaint to the authorities in Pekin. As it is, I have sent a
                                strong note to Prince Kung concerning this matter, and have improved
                                the occasion to point out the causes which led to this unhappy state
                                of affairs, and impressed upon him the necessity of prompt action on
                                the part of the government in order to avoid consequences that may
                                be disastrous. As yet no reply has been received, but I hear
                                unofficially that stringent orders went immediately to the
                                provincial authorities in Shan-tung, which will, I hope, have a good
                                effect.</p>
                            <p>Without pretending to question the propriety of your course in view
                                of the danger which appeared to surround you, and conceding that you
                                ought to be able to judge better of the value of the reports than I
                                possibly can at this distance, I cannot repress a feeling of keen
                                regret that you felt compelled to abandon, even temporarily, afield
                                that had cost such a struggle to win, and that your action will be
                                likely to strengthen the anti-foreign feeling—not only in Tungchow
                                but in other places, and render the residence of missionaries in
                                China more uncomfortable than it has been hitherto.</p>
                            <p>My opinion is that the <hi rend="italic">male members</hi> of your
                                mission should return at the earliest moment they can get a
                                reasonable assurance of safety, and as you were taken away in a
                                vessel of war, I desire very much that you shall return in a <hi
                                    rend="italic">United States vessel</hi>, when <pb n="390"
                                    xml:id="pg_390" facs="0424"/>yon go. I expect one or more of the
                                fleet will be at Che Foo shortly, and as soon as I hear of the
                                arrival of any, I shall ask that you be returned to your post of
                                duty under the protection of your country’s flag, should you so
                                desire.</p>
                            <p>If one of our vessels should come, and not be likely to remain long
                                enough to communicate with me, you are at liberty to read this
                                letter to the commanding officer, and ask, in my name, the services
                                of his vessel for the purpose indicated above.</p>
                            <p>I hope to hear soon that active and honest measures are being taken
                                by the officials for your protection, and that you are all safely
                                back again in your field of labor.</p>

                                effect that, in consequence of reports of an intended attack by the
                                Chinese upon the American Protestant missionaries at Tungchow, in
                                the province of Shan-tung, and the usual land communication being
                                considered unsafe, application was made to the United States
                                vice-consul at Che Foo for relief, to enable them to reach a place
                                of safety. In the absence of a United States vessel of war at Chee
                                Foo, the vice-consul made application to Sir Henry Kellett, K. C.
                                B., commanding her Majesty’s naval forces in these waters, to afford
                                the necessary relief.</p>
                            <p>With a generosity and promptitude characteristic of her Majesty’s
                                naval officers, Admiral Kellett dispatched two vessels, the Barrossa
                                and Grasshopper, on the 1st instant, to Tungchow, and took away the
                                missionaries and their families, and landed them safely at Chee

                                the people who were relieved, I beg most respectfully to tender to
                                you, and through you to Admiral Kellett, my grateful acknowledgments
                                for this humane and generous action. I shall improve an early
                                opportunity to lay the facts before my Government, and I would feel
                                obliged if you would make them known to her Majesty’s government

                                    Tungchow, in Shan-tung, to which all are to give earnest heed.
                                    Issued September</hi> 2, 1870.</p>
                            <p>It appears that in consequence of the flagitious conduct of lawless
                                men at Tien-tsin, bewitching and carrying off children, in which
                                they implicated the Roman Catholics there, many people have
                                suspected that a quarrel would grow out of it, and have fomented
                                disturbance. In consequence, every kind of wild rumor has spread
                                from thence through the land, which has incited reckless loafers to
                                hatch trouble and fan suspicions, particularly saying that all
                                foreigners are to be killed. These falsehoods have disturbed
                                foreigners, [dwelling here,] and led them to suspend their work, and
                                rapidly move away from the place to avoid danger, their converts
                                also laboring under the same erroneous views. Such men, like
                                unscrupulous rascals, cannot be suffered for a single day, and it is
                                hard to imagine what object they can have in getting up these
                                suspicions to breed trouble. I have sent policemen here and there to
                                secretly ascertain who they are and seize them, and I also now issue
                                this proclamation for general information, and call on all, soldiers
                                and people, to fully observe its orders. Hereafter, let each of you
                                carefully attend to his own business, and neither start nor give
                                heed to idle canards, calculated to excite trouble and bring
                                misfortune on yourselves, If any dare disobey this, they shall be
                                summarily seized, and the lives of themselves and families
                                immediately pay the penalty. They will then have no place for
                                repentance.</p>

                                    the middle brigade at Tungchow, &amp;c., strictly prohibiting
                                    the circulation of rumors. Issued September</hi> 2, 1870.</p>
                            <p>It is well known that English and American missionaries have lived in
                                this city many years, engaged day and night in disseminating and
                                explaining the holy religion of <pb n="391" xml:id="pg_391"
                                    facs="0425"/>Jesus, and urging men to be good. Recently certain
                                fellows among the soldiers and people have been talking wildly about
                                the affair at Tien-tsin, blabbing this and that strange story, which
                                is nothing less than to utter seditious rumors for the purpose of
                                exciting suspicion and change. Such men, like reckless villains, are
                                only on the lookout for a chance to take advantage of some trouble
                                to rob and sack; they are all out of the pale of law, and excite
                                everybody’s indignation.</p>
                            <p>I have secretly sent out men who are ordered to inquire for and seize
                                any one found doing these things, and I further now issue this plain
                                proclamation for the general information of all classes of people.
                                Hereafter let every one contentedly attend to his own affairs, and
                                give no heed to the wild talk about affairs between natives and
                                foreigners. Whoever is found violating this command will be tried in
                                this court, and I shall ask the higher officers to have him executed
                                by martial law. No leniency will be shown, and let no one,
                                therefore, say he has not been warned, but let every one give
                                careful heed to this special proclamation.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> Referring to my dispatch No. 29, relating
                            to the withdrawal of the missionaries from Tungchow, I have now the
                            honor to inclose copies of my note, called out by this affair, to Prince
                            Kung, (inclosure A;) his reply thereto, (inclosure B,) and another note
                            from Prince Kung transmitting a decree of the Emperor, (inclosure
                            C.)</p>
                        <p>In view of the disturbed condition of the country, caused by rumors of
                            intended violence, and believing that these rumors, as well as the
                            hostile spirit exhibited by the natives, are caused mainly by the late
                            massacre at Tien-tsin, and that the delay and uncertainty in the
                            punishment of the guilty lead the people in other places to believe that
                            the riot was justifiable and meets with the implied approval of the
                            government rather than its condemnation, I deemed it entirely proper, as
                            well as my duty, to improve the occasion to review the Tien-tsin affair,
                            giving to the prince my opinions regarding the failure thus far of the
                            government to do its duty, and pointing out the peril in which the lives
                            and property of all foreign residents are placed in consequence of this
                            dilatory, halting, and uncertain policy. I also referred to the
                            possibility of dangerous complications growing out of this affair unless
                            a more rigorous course be pursued. The note is strong, though entirely
                            respectful, and will, I hope, have some effect for good. I beg,
                            most-respectfully, to refer to that document for a resumé of my opinions
                            upon the situation.</p>
                        <p>In this connection I desire to say that, while I believe there is danger,
                            I by no means consider the situation as perilous as the people generally
                            do; at the same time they may be right and I wrong.</p>
                        <p>The prince’s reply, while it is entirely satisfactory with regard to the
                            immediate subject which called it forth, the Tungchow disturbance, fails
                            entirely to meet the general question in a proper way. It is simply an
                            apology for the delay, and affords no reasonable ground for believing
                            that such steps will be taken as will quiet the turbulence of the
                            people, and reëstablish confidence among the foreign residents. He
                            intimates that there have been and are still difficulties in the way of
                            speedy action. This I am prepared to believe; but these difficulties, in
                            my opinion, could be surmounted if the prince and his associates would
                            exhibit a little more courage and resolution.</p>
                        <p>The hostile spirit of the people at Tien-tsin undoubtedly deterred the
                            officials from taking prompt action in the beginning, lest the attempt
                            at <pb n="392" xml:id="pg_392" facs="0426"/>summary punishment of the
                            rioters should cause another uprising for their protection and
                            deliverance; and the unwise action of the French chargé d’affaires
                            raised such a storm of opposition in the higher official circles to
                            prevent a compliance with the demand made by him, that Prince Kung and
                            his associates were, for a time, powerless. These reasons are without
                            force now, and afford no apology for delay.</p>
                        <p>It is undoubtedly true, that immediately after the receipt and rejection
                            of what may properly be termed M. de Rochechoart’s ultimatum, the
                            government expected a hostile demonstration from France, and commenced
                            making preparations to resist an attack. Li-Hung-Chang, an able official
                            and a general of distinction, who was then in command of the imperial
                            forces operating in the west against the Mohammedan rebels, was called
                            to Tien-tsin, with all the troops that could be spared from the western
                            armies. More recently he has been appointed governor general of this
                            province. He has now arrived, and has, it is said, from 10,000 to 20,000
                            troops near him at Tien-tsin. The moving of these troops gave rise to
                            all sorts of rumors of an intended attack upon foreigners.</p>
                        <p>My own opinion is, however, that the ordering of these troops to
                            Tien-tsin was solely with a view to defense in case of attack by the
                            French.</p>
                        <p>The news from Europe must have dispelled all apprehensions of any hostile
                            movement this autumn. It has also, I am sorry to say, had the effect to
                            make the officials more dilatory in their actions and less inclined to
                            do their duty promptly and properly.</p>
                        <p>The latest intelligence from Europe via St. Petersburg announces the
                            defeat and surrender of a large part of the French army, with the
                            Emperor at its head, the overthrow of the government and the
                            proclamation of a new one instead. In view of this startling and
                            unexpected news, the French chargé called his colleagues together on the
                            24th instant, and asked their advice and assistance in the common
                            interest of all. We have taken hold of the question and shall do what we
                            can; but the situation now is difficult and somewhat embarrassing, and I
                            am not sanguine as to results. The representatives of Great Britain,
                            Russia, North Germany and the United States, joined in a note to Prince
                            Kung, on the 24th instant, but as yet no reply has been received. I
                            defer sending a copy or making further comments until an answer comes
                            and I get more light.</p>
                        <p>If I appear to overburden the Department with dispatches and papers
                            concerning affairs here, my apology must lie in the fact that it is
                            altogether probable that correspondence and consultation will be
                            necessary between the chief treaty powers, growing out of political
                            questions here; and it is my desire that the Department may be in
                            possession of all the information necessary to form intelligent and
                            correct opinions upon all the questions involved.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                                in consequence of the threatening attitude of the people, and
                                failing to obtain from the local officials any satisfactory
                                assurances of protection, the American missionaries residing at
                                Tungchow, near Che Foo, deemed it prudent to withdraw temporarily to
                                the latter place. The danger to them appearing so imminent, the
                                ordinary routes of land travel being considered unsafe, <pb n="393"
                                    xml:id="pg_393" facs="0427"/>and there being no other means of
                                transport by water available, the admiral of her Majesty’s fleet in
                                these waters, upon the request of the United States vice-consul at
                                Che Foo, kindly sent two vessels of war on the 1st instant and
                                transported the missionaries with their families to Che Foo, where
                                they now are. The number of men, women, and children attached to the
                                mission is eighteen, all Americans. One of the missionaries, in
                                advising me of their action and the causes which led to it, asks my
                                advice as to the proper course for them to pursue, having in view
                                their personal safety and the security of their property which was
                                necessarily left behind at Tungchow. Before replying to this letter,
                                I deem it proper to lay the facts in this case before your imperial
                                highness, and, at the same time, offer some observations upon the
                                unhappy state of affairs which exists at Tungchow and other
                                places.</p>
                            <p>It is a fact, painfully apparent to all foreign residents, that,
                                since the terrible tragedy at Tien-tsin, the attitude of the local
                                officials and the people generally there, and at many other places,
                                toward foreigners, has been in marked contrast to that kind and
                                cordial relation which should exist. It is unnecessary here to
                                inquire whether the outbreak at Tien-tsin was a sudden uprising of
                                the people to redress, by violence, fancied wrongs, and was
                                altogether local in its origin, or whether it was a part of a more
                                extended and wide-spread conspiracy, fomented by designing officials
                                and persons of the higher classes of civilians, without cause, other
                                than a purpose of gratifying a long-cherished hatred and desire for
                                revenge against the people of western nations; whether the wrath of
                                the people was directed specially against the French as a
                                nationality, and the Roman Catholics as a religious body, or whether
                                all nationalities and religions would have suffered equally, had
                                they resided within the territory where the mob assembled, and near
                                the scene of its bloody deeds. Without discussing the <hi

                                to your imperial highness the result of my conclusions as to the <hi

                                affair at Tien-tsin has had upon the people in other places.</p>
                            <p>The tales of horrible cruelties practiced by the Roman Catholics are
                                now reported and believed by the people generally, notwithstanding
                                the report, after searching investigation, of the high officer
                                Tsing-Kwoh-fan to the contrary, and in opposition to the solemn
                                delarations of the Emperor, that all these stories are without
                                foundation and false. It seems scarcely possible that such opinions
                                can be entertained by the common people against the evidence before
                                referred to, upon any other hypothesis than that the local officials
                                and persons of rank and distinction are bringing an influence to
                                bear to render foreigners distasteful in the eyes of the people, and
                                inciting hostility which will, unless checked promptly, be likely to
                                bring on a collision.</p>
                            <p>There is no evidence of any change for the better in the feelings of
                                the inhabitants of Tien-tsin, nor are there any signs of regret for
                                the terrible scenes enacted on the 21st June. On the contrary, the
                                manufacture and sale of fans (until stopped by official action upon
                                the complaint of a foreign consul) bearing engravings of the burning
                                buildings and the murder of their inmates, show only too plainly
                                that the people of that city desire by illustrations of their bloody
                                deeds to be reminded of the eventful day when innocent and helpless
                                women were, with others, ruthlessly sacrificed. The failure to
                                punish any of the guilty actors, although nearly three months have
                                since elapsed, tends in no small degree to confirm the people in the
                                belief that the riot was a justifiable retribution, in which the
                                government sympathizes; and leads to the belief that similar attacks
                                upon foreigners will meet with official sanction and approval,
                                rather than condemnation and punishment. In addition to all this,
                                the knowledge that large bodies of troops are moving from the
                                western provinces eastward into Shan-tung and Chihli affords a basis
                                for the evil-disposed to circulate reports that the imperial
                                government has designs hostile to the foreign residents. This adds
                                to the excitement and fills with alarm the missionaries and others
                                residing in the two provinces before named.</p>
                            <p>It was currently reported in Tungchow during the last days in August,
                                that 2,000 troops were marching from the capital of the province
                                toward that place, preparatory to the extermination of the
                                missionaries, and threats were freely and openly indulged in that,
                                on the 10th of September all foreigners would be sacrificed. So
                                general was the belief that the native servants of the missionaries
                                were appealed to by their friends and relatives to leave their
                                employers before the day appointed, otherwise their lives would
                                probably be sacrificed with the rest. The missionaries, hearing
                                these reports from distinct and separate sources, felt compelled to
                                give heed to them, and failing to get any satisfactory refutation of
                                the reports, or any guarantee of safety from the local officials,
                                concluded to take the steps I have before indicated.</p>
                            <p>In the collective note of the 24th June, in which all the foreign
                                representatives joined, the danger of dilatory action on the part of
                                the government was pointed out, and grave apprehensions of further
                                trouble were felt, unless the uprising at Tien-tsin was promptly and
                                effectually put down; and in personal interviews which I have had
                                the honor to have with your imperial highness and the other members
                                of the Foreign Office since, I have urgently pressed upon you and
                                them the necessity of prompt and decided action in the way of
                                searching out and punishing the guilty. I have also <pb n="394"
                                    xml:id="pg_394" facs="0428"/>pointed out the great importance of
                                taking every means to enlighten and instruct the people in regard to
                                the peaceful purposes of all foreign residents, and the missionaries
                                in particular; that no foreigner has been, or possibly can be,
                                guilty of the practices imputed to them by the ignorant and
                                superstitious, and that all missionaries are animated by pure and
                                peaceful motives, engaged in no political intrigue, and seeking only
                                the highest welfare of the people by striving to make them honest
                                and good.</p>
                            <p>Candor compels me to say that there has been a lack of promptness,
                                and, I believe, of earnestness, on the part of the officials deputed
                                by the government to ascertain and bring to punishment the guilty
                                persons at Tien-tsin.</p>
                            <p>Prior to the troubles, two persons at Tien-tsin, and a larger number
                                at Nankin, accused of kidnapping, were arrested, tried, and punished
                                with the extreme penalty of the law; and in the case of the latter
                                the extreme haste of the officials in the trials and punishment of
                                the criminals provoked much discussion, and, I am informed, called
                                forth protests against what seemed to be indecent haste. If the law
                                sanctioned these hasty trials and summary executions in cases where
                                kidnapping was the crime, I fail to see why the assassins of
                                peaceful foreign residents, including foreign officials and innocent
                                and unoffending women, should have any greater lenity shown them;
                                and in a place where the known participation in the riot is an honor
                                and its leadership a notable distinction, it ought not to be
                                difficult to ascertain who are the guilty ones deserving punishment.
                                Hence the delay appears to be without cause, and leads many to doubt
                                the good faith of the government. Unless a change in the status of
                                affairs soon occurs, which will reëstablish public confidence in the
                                fidelity of the government to its treaty obligations, which will
                                reassure the citizens and subjects of the treaty powers that their
                                residence in China will be safe and their property protected, grave
                                apprehensions may reasonably be entertained that the good will and
                                cordial support of some of the most influential and powerful of the
                                western nations will be lost to China.</p>
                            <p>The traditional policy of the United States in their intercourse with
                                China is peace, which it is the earnest desire of the undersigned,
                                as well as his Government, to maintain, and nothing will cause a
                                departure from this policy, except the flagrant violation of the
                                rights and privileges of their citizens by the people and the
                                failure of the imperial government to apply the proper remedy
                                promptly. In view of these considerations, I again most earnestly
                                call your attention to the condition of affairs at Tung-chow, to the
                                end that you will cause such measures to be adopted as will assure
                                citizens of the United States of their safety, and hasten the return
                                of the missionaries to their homes and their posts of duty.</p>
                            <p>In the foregoing I have, with entire frankness, endeavored to place
                                before your imperial highness a plain exposition of the situation in
                                which all foreigners in the empire are placed, and the danger to
                                which they are exposed, which will, unless speedily averted, lead to
                                the most unhappy consequences.</p>
                            <p>With renewed assurances of my high consideration, I have the honor to
                                be, your imperial highness’ obedient servant.</p>

                            <p>Prince Kung, chief secretary of state for foreign affairs, herewith
                                sends a reply:</p>
                            <p>I had the honor to receive your dispatch of the 16th instant, in
                                which you inform me that Mr. Mateer and other American missionaries
                                residing at Tungchow, in Shan-tung, had written to you, stating that
                                rumors had been rife among the citizens there during this and last
                                month; that in consequence of the Tien-tsin riot, a body of troops
                                from the provincial capital Tsinan would reach it on the 10th of
                                September, whereupon their scholars and servants left them, and they
                                with their familes had all gone aboard ship, and temporarily removed
                                to Che Foo, from whence they had inquired of you whether they had
                                better go back to Tungchow or not; but before replying, you
                                concluded to bring the matter to my notice, alluding moreover to the
                                present state of unrest between natives and foreigners, and asking
                                that orders may be sent to the officials in Shan-tung to take
                                measures to remove the fears of the missionaries, and assure their
                                safe residence in Tungchow, &amp;e., &amp;c.</p>
                            <p>In respect to the rumors circulated at Tungchow, I have to reply that
                                before I had received your excellency’s dispatch orders had been
                                sent from the Foreign Office to the provincial governor, and to the
                                intendant of Tungchow, immediately to issue proclamations clearly
                                making known to the people that the rumors were quite groundless,
                                and they were to give no credence to them; and as they caused mutual
                                distrust and alarm, these officers were to take measures to
                                dissipate suspicions of this kind, so that foreigners and natives
                                could henceforth live peaceably together.</p>
                            <p>Further orders were yesterday sent to Governor Ting (of Shan-tung) to
                                enjoin upon <pb n="395" xml:id="pg_395" facs="0429"/>the district
                                magistrate of Punglai (<hi rend="italic">i.</hi>
                                <hi rend="italic">e.,</hi> Tungchow City) to adopt precautionary
                                measures to remove all doubt and alarm, so that when Mr. Mateer and
                                his associates return their safety can be assured. The day fixed by
                                rumor, September 10, for bringing in soldiers, and destroying the
                                missionaries, having long since passed over without disturbance,
                                plainly shows that the whole was a rumor, unworthy of belief, which
                                need have excited no alarm.</p>
                            <p>The doubt which your excellency expresses, that the delay in settling
                                the riot of Tien-tsin, and the want of energy manifested in dealing
                                with it, considering the serious consequences likely to result from
                                it, are calculated to lead all western nations to doubt the faith
                                and earnestness of the government, arouses in my mind the closest
                                attention and shows your full knowledge of the matter. In dealing
                                with an affair like this, that involves the relations between this
                                and other countries, it is indeed important that the government
                                should earnestly put forth its utmost energy, uniting safety with
                                speed in bringing it to a close. But in dealing with the
                                difficulties of this case we have proved the truth of the saying,
                                “the more haste the worse speed;” having found that the two arc
                                incompatible, the wisest course for us seems to be to humor things
                                so as to attain the end safely. Can any one doubt that government
                                desires to speedily bring the Tien-tsin riot and all that has grown
                                out of it to a close? Yet to arrest the murderers is not easy; to
                                find the clue to them is hard; but the hardest of all is to
                                reconcile the evidence obtained, for the whole affair was done on a
                                sudden provocation and had no leader who had planned it. When a
                                great crowd rushes together in a frenzy, the course of events cannot
                                be closely remembered, nor who it was that killed the victims be
                                certainly found out or known. The names of the leaders or the actual
                                murderers are not ascertainable, and this makes the difficulty in
                                arresting them. When robbers plunder and secrete their booty, it is
                                comparatively easy to trace them; but here all the world ran about
                                in commingling crowds, without order or leaders, and this is what
                                makes it so hard for us to get any clue to the guilty. In common
                                cases of robbery or murder the plunder is hid somewhere, or there is
                                proof of the killing; somebody has taken the lead in the act; but in
                                this instance there is nothing, no booty, no proof, no leader,
                                nothing to guide to a conviction. But the most difficult part is in
                                discriminating the evidence, for if the prisoners are verbally
                                interrogated their testimony is not true probably, and if they are
                                put to the question they are ready to implicate the innocent. This
                                shows the difficulties in the way of getting evidence. Amidst these
                                various obstacles, if the settlement of this affair be unduly
                                hurried, not only will it be hard to satisfy the Chinese people that
                                justice has been done, but I fear that foreigners will also be
                                disappointed. These are the causes which have delayed the settlement
                                of the Tien-tsin affair. Many guilty persons are already in custody,
                                among whom ten or more have been proven to be guilty and will suffer
                                the extreme penalty of the law. I think that their cases will be
                                closed in a few days and will remove all doubts as to whether
                                anything would be done. I have thus endeavored to state my
                                difficulties in conducting this affair, both toward my own
                                government and toward foreign nations, and I hope that your
                                excellency and all the other foreign ministers will appreciate the
                                contingencies of my position.</p>

                            <p>Prince Kung, chief secretary of state for foreign affairs, herewith
                                sends a communication:</p>
                            <p>I was yesterday honored by receiving the following decree.</p>
                            <p>“Li Hung-chang having been appointed governor general of the province
                                of Child, let him immediately proceed to Tien-tsin, and in
                                conjunction with Tsang kwoh-fan, Ting Jih-chang and Chinglin,
                                inquire into and manage affairs there. Let Mao Changhi, the
                                president of the board of works, return to Pekin and resume his
                                duties. Respect this.”</p>
                            <p>With respect to the Tien-tsin case I may observe that during the
                                three months which have passed, Governor General Tsang and his
                                colleagues have searched out and arrested more than eighty of the
                                criminals engaged in the riot, and he is now employed in examining
                                them and taking testimony; he will, without doubt, be able to
                                ascertain clearly who are guilty and decide their sentences.</p>
                            <p>His excellency Li having received the above order to go to Tien-tsin,
                                he will join in the inquiry and hasten the matter, so that there
                                seems now a strong probability that this affair may ere long be
                                brought to a conclusion.</p>

                        <p>The following telegram was sent to-day to Bancroft. Communicate its
                            substance verbally to Lord Granville:</p>
                        <p>It appears to the President that the hostilities between France and
                            Germany, if conducted in Chinese waters, will operate on the minds of
                            the Chinese to put in peril the lives of Europeans and Americans in that
                            empire. You are instructed to sound the government of North Germany to
                            ascertain whether it is possible to obtain a suspension of hostilities
                            and a coöperative action between the squadrons in the Chinese waters, so
                            far as the protection of the lives and property of Americans and
                            Europeans may require. In case the answer is favorable you will ask
                            leave to commuuicate their action to Washburne, and will send him a copy
                            of this telegram, which he will take as his authority to ask for a like
                            action on the part of the French government.</p>

                        <p>On communicating verbally this morning the substance of your telegram to
                            Bancroft, Granville requested me to inform you that what you proposed
                            had already been done. Commander of the Prussian naval forces in China
                            had proposed to the French commander their coöperative action to protect
                            European life and property. English government had already signified its
                            cordial applause of the step to both belligerents, and Granville hopes
                            that you may be inclined to the same course without preliminary
                            formalities.</p>

                            Granville infers that French government sanctions the step, but is not
                            sure that Prussian has done so. What you propose is begun with good

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir: R</hi>eferring to my No. 259, inclosing a copy
                            of Mr. Fish’s telegram of the 1st instant, instructing you to propose to
                            the North German government a suspension of hostilities in Chinese
                            waters, I have to say that no reply or acknowledgment has been
                            received.</p>
                        <p>When the massacre of Tien-tsin took place, Mr. Low was of opinion that
                            the outbreak was a local one and unpremeditated, * * * * and although
                            the Chinese populace were still much excited, Mr. Low thought that the
                            danger was over, that the government was sincere in its intention to
                            prevent a repetition, and to punish the offenders, and that there was no
                            probability of similar outbreaks elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>In his subsequent dispatches he still adheres to his original opinion
                            that the disturbance was local and unpremeditated, and that the
                            government at Pekin sincerely desired to prevent a repetition and to
                            preserve peace; but he appears to have decidedly modified his opinion as
                            to the probability that they will be able to do so. His doubts are
                            founded on the injudicious course pursued by the French chargé
                            d’affaires in demanding the summary execution of the Tien-tsin officials
                            as an ultimatum, and upon the hopes the populace in the large Chinese
                            cities derive from the state of war existing between Germany and France,
                            which they argue will neutralize the force of those two powers. He
                            expresses the fear that the government at Pekin may find itself too weak
                            to resist the pressure of popular opinion in the masses, acting in
                            harmony with the cherished wishes and purposes of the literati, and that
                            it may be forced into war to prevent popular outbreaks.</p>
                        <p>It seemed to the President that these views coming from a gentleman so
                            cautious, dispassionate, and prudent as Mr. Low, were entitled to more
                            than the ordinary consideration. He therefore directed, after
                            consultation with the cabinet, the telegram of the 1st instant to be
                            sent to you, believing that any advantage which one belligerent might
                            gain over the other in eastern waters would be of small consequence to
                            the victor, compared with the preservation of peace in China.</p>
                        <p>The President does not intend to depart from the policy pointed out in
                            Mr. Fish’s dispatch No. 148, of August 31, 1869. He does not propose to
                            take part, nor does he invite North Germany to take part in any
                            controversy between France and China growing out of the massacré of
                            Tien-tsin. He only desires that so far as the impression of the
                            neutralization of German and French influence by the state of
                            hostilities operated to enfeeble the central government, that impression
                            may be removed; and that should unfortunately a general war be declared
                            by China, or should an outbreak against foreigners take place which the
                            government cannot prevent nor punish, the several powers may be in a
                            position to afford the fullest measure of protection.</p>
                        <p>I inclose copies of two telegrams from Mr. Motley, which would seem to
                            indicate that the commanders of the French and Prussian fleets have come
                            to some understanding, but it is not clear that this has been ratified
                            at Berlin and Paris.</p>
                        <p>I also inclose a copy of a communication of the 5th instant from Baron
                            Gerolt bearing upon this subject.</p>

                        <p>It appears to the President that the hostilities between France and
                            Germany, if conducted in Chinese waters, will operate in the minds of
                            the Chinese to put in peril the lives of Europeans and Americans in that
                            empire. You are instructed to sound the government; of North Germany to
                            ascertain whether it is possible to obtain suspension of hostilities or
                            a coöperative action between the squadrons in the Chinese waters so far
                            as the protection of the lives and property of Americans and Europeans
                            may require. In case the answer is favorable, you will ask leave to
                            communicate their action to Washburne, and will send him a copy of this
                            telegram, which he will take as his authority to ask for a like action
                            on the part of French government.</p>

                            your correspondence with Prince Kung upon the removal of the
                            missionaries from Tung-chow and the disturbed condition of affairs in

                            apply the proper remedy promptly, are the only circumstances which will

                            their intercourse with China, is considered to be too strong an
                            assurance of forbearance, and it would be, perhaps, well that Prince
                            Kung should understand that any violation of the rights of our citizens
                            and any flagrant violation of treaty stipulations of other powers may

                            <p>After the completion of the survey of the reservation selected by the
                                hoard General Sykes left me, and I went at once to Pembina, camping
                                near the post set up by Major Long, which post is at present
                                recognized as the boundary line between the United States and the
                                British Possessions. Here, in accordance with verbal instructions
                                received from Major General Hancock, I commenced at once taking
                                observations for latitude, to determine the true position of the
                                forty-ninth parallel. Both Mr. King and myself took a large number
                                of observations, remaining five days at this camp for this purpose.
                                From the whole number I selected six observations which I believed
                                to be the most accurate and reliable, and which most closely agreed
                                with each other. A mean of these six places Long’s post in latitude
                                48° 59' 13?, or 4,763 feet south of the forty-ninth parallel. The
                                result I believe to be as accurate as could be obtained with the
                                instruments at my disposal. Observations with finer instruments may
                                change the result somewhat.</p>
                            <p>It so happened that of the six observations selected, three were
                                taken by Mr. King and three by myself.</p>
                            <p>Having determined the latitude, I planted a large oak post 4,763 feet
                                north of Long’s post, on the edge of the woods on the west bank of
                                the Red River. On this post “U. S.” was chiseled on the south side,
                                “B. P.” on the north side, and “49th °” on top. From this point I
                                ran the parallel thirty-five miles west, nearly to the foot of
                                Pembina Mountain, marking each mile by a stout stake driven through
                                three sods, cut on the direction of the parallel. Each stake has “U.
                                S.” chiseled on its south side, and “B. P.” on its north side.</p>
                            <p>It may be interesting to know that while running the parallel, I saw
                                drift-wood five miles west of Red River.</p>
                            <p>The ground from the Red River to the foot of Pembina Mountain has a
                                gradual upward slope of not much more, I should judge, than one foot
                                to the mile.</p>
                            <p>Having completed this duty, which took me till June 3, I rested one
                                day, and on June 5 started for Fort Wadsworth, via Fort Totten. Mr.
                                Bellon, guide at Fort Totten, was going there at the time, and could
                                be of service to me; and I was also enabled to measure the distance
                                from St. Joseph to Fort Totten and make a map of the country.</p>
                            <p>I reached Fort Totten on June 8. The distance is about one hundred
                                and eight miles; plenty of water along the route at this season; in
                                dry weather there is scarcely any. No wood from Pembina Mountain to
                                east end of Devil’s Lake; roads generally good.</p>

                            letter, dated the 23d ul timo, from the collector of customs at Pembina,
                            Minnesota, relative to a change effected by a survey recently made by a
                            United States military commission, under Major General Sykes, United
                            States Army, in the line heretofore recognized as the proper boundary

                            fixed by treaty at the forty-ninth parallel of latitude. It is therein
                            stated that the line now established is 4,600 feet north of that
                            heretofore recognized, and the results of the change are, in one
                            respect, at least, noted therein.</p>

                                the actual boundary line, would subject the whole of said Hudson’s

                                future importations thereto, to the payment of duty. I have
                                therefore ordered a full inventory of all their goods and effects
                                for the purpose of assessment of duty, in case the said last
                                established line shall be recognized as the true boundary.</p>
                            <p>I would, therefore, in view of these facts, respectfully request
                                instructions in the premises, and. beg to be advised as to which of
                                the two different lines established I am to recognize as the true

                            <p>It appears by a communication from the honorable the Secretary of the
                                Treasury of the United States to the State Department, inclosing a
                                letter of the 23d June last from the collector of customs at
                                Pembina, Minnesota, that the United States military commission under
                                Major General Sykes, United States Army, had by a series of careful
                                solar and lunar observations located and established the forty-ninth
                                parallel, or international boundary line, upward of 4,600 feet north
                                of the one hitherto recognized. The result of this change in one
                                respect at least your lordship will find noted in the above-cited
                                letter of the collector of Pembina, copy of which I annex among
                                other documents.</p>
                            <p>The question arising at the Treasury Department, whether the said new

                                two governments of Great Britain and the United States, has been
                                answered, as you will observe, by inclosed copy of a letter from the
                                acting Secretary of State of the United States, that no joint action
                                of the two governments had been taken for marking upon the surface
                                of the ground that portion of the boundary along the forty-ninth
                                parallel which extends from the Lake of the Woods to the Rocky or

                            <p>It has therefore been suggested by the State Department that no
                                proceedings be adopted by the custom-house authorities which will
                                disturb the existing condition of things on the border until the

                            from the United States Government, took observations to fix the exact

                            and after spending several days on this service, erected a post on the
                            bank of the river to mark the spot.</p>
                        <p>This post is about a quarter of a mile to the south of the Hudson’s Bay
                            Company’s fort, and is still standing.</p>
                        <p>Some time about 1860, the people of Pembina erected another post on the
                            river about a mile to the north of the first post.</p>
                        <p>A man from the Red River Settlement had put up a house close to the
                            boundary line, and was carrying on a trade in whisky which was. smuggled
                            into the village of Pembina, and this post was put up and the local
                            authorities claimed jurisdiction to it so as to drive the party away. It
                            was known by the name of the Whisky post.</p>
                        <p>Last spring a corps of engineers were sent out by the United States
                            Government to lay off a military reserve in the neighborhood of the
                            boundary line, and a series of observations was made to fix the
                            parallel. Eventually they put up a post which is about half way between
                            the original post and the so-called “Whisky post,” but at such a point
                            as to <pb n="404" xml:id="pg_404" facs="0438"/>throw the Hudson’s Bay
                            Company’s fort into the territory of the United States.</p>
                        <p>Whether the post which was erected last spring is on the forty-ninth
                            parallel or not, can easily be verified; but, in the mean time it would
                            be very desirable that the small force now in that neighborhood should
                            remain there for the protection of persons and the security of the
                            mails. The only shelter, however, which they can find is in the Hudson’s
                            Bay Company’s fort. The Governor General has therefore forwarded a
                            request from the Canadian government that I would confer with the
                            Secretary of State as to the expediency of allowing the boundary line
                            which was run by Captain Pope to be considered as the boundary for the
                            present, until the real boundary is ascertained and finally settled, so
                            that the Hudson’s Bay post may be used as a shelter during the winter$
                            for they consider that it is in the interests of the inhabitants on both
                            sides of the line that order should be preserved on the frontier, which
                            result can best be obtained by a body of troops of both nations being
                            stationed in its vicinity.</p>
                        <p>I have therefore the honor to ask that this proposal may be taken into
                            consideration, and to express a hope that the Government of the United
                            States will view it favorably.</p>

                        <p>I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your note of the 4th
                            instant, touching the discovery made last spring by a corps of the
                            engineers of the army of the United States, as the result of a series of
                            observations that the 49th parallel of latitude, when correctly run,
                            throws the Hudson’s Bay Company’s fort into the territory of the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>Your excellency is also pleased to inform me that in the year 1850, the
                            present General (then Captain) Pope, under authority from the United
                            States Government, took observations to fix the exact spot where the
                            49th parallel of latitude crosses the Red River, and that, after
                            spending several days on this service, he erected a post on the bank of
                            the river to mark this spot, which post is about a quarter of a mile to
                            the south of the Hudson’s Bay Company’s fort, and you propose to allow
                            the boundary line which was run by Captain Pope to be considered as the
                            boundary for the present until the real boundary is ascertained and
                            finally settled, so that the Hudson’s Bay post may be used as a shelter
                            during the winter.</p>
                        <p>I am directed by the President, to whom this proposition has been
                            submitted, to say that he has no information other than that contained
                            in your letter, as to the observations said to have been made by Captain
                            Pope in 1850, and as to their result. Without waiting, however, to
                            ascertain whether those alleged acts were or were not done under
                            instructions, he directs me to say that this Government will not for the
                            present object to the occupation by her Majesty’s subjects of the
                            territory near Pembina, of which the sovereignty is thrown in doubt by
                            the result of the observations of last spring.</p>
                        <p>It is, as you correctly remark, easy to verify whether the post which <pb
                                n="405" xml:id="pg_405" facs="0439"/>was erected last spring is on
                            the 49th parallel or not, and the interest of both countries would seem
                            to call for an early settlement of the question by a joint survey before
                            further emigration into that country, and by jointly fixing upon the
                            surface of the ground monuments to mark the line of the boundary which
                            may be established.</p>
                        <p>Until Congress shall make an appropriation for that purpose, this
                            Government will not be in a position to propose to her Majesty’s
                            government the establishment of such a commission. This department will
                            endeavor, at the earliest possible day, to obtain from the War
                            Department an estimate of the probable expense to the United States of
                            such a commission with a view of submitting the estimates to Congress at
                            the coming session and of asking for an appropriation for the purpose
                            indicated. It is hoped that her Majesty’s government, if not already
                            empowered, will take similar steps so that so much of the land boundary
                            to the west of the Lake of the Woods, between the United States and the
                            dominions of her Majesty, as has not been already fixed, may be
                            determined and marked by permanent monuments upon the surface of the
                            ground, beginning with the Red River country.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In reply to the communication of the
                                7th instant, from the Department of State, asking for an estimate of
                                the probable cost of surveying and marking the boundary between the
                                United States and the British possessions, from the Lake of the
                                Woods to the Rocky Mountains, I beg to reply that a
                                properly-organized commission, with two sets of astronomical and
                                surveying parties to expedite the work, would require, from the
                                estimate hereunto annexed, an expenditure of about $100,000 yearly
                                while actually engaged upon field duties.</p>
                            <p>But it is not possible to state with certainty the length of time
                                required to trace and mark the whole line, as the progress that
                                would be made depends upon the nature of the country to be passed
                                over.</p>
                            <p>The line is about eight hundred and sixty miles long. The season for
                                working to advantage is short, and although the country is generally
                                an open one, the number of astronomical stations to be occupied,
                                upon which the rate of progress mainly rests, depends so much upon
                                the distance of prominent points of elevation from each other that
                                they cannot be estimated.</p>
                            <p>From one month to six weeks would, no doubt, making due allowance for
                                bad weather, be required to establish, astronomically, a point on
                                the parallel to trace its connection with a preceding one and to
                                move the party to the next. Should these points average fifty miles
                                apart, there would be some seventeen stations, or say eight stations
                                for each astronomical party, to occupy which would consume from
                                eight to twelve months actual field duty for the completion of the
                                line.</p>
                            <p>It is not probable that the parties can be kept in the field
                                continuously for this length of time, but that the work would have
                                to run through two seasons at least, if not longer.</p>
                            <p>The services of the officers and the greater part of their assistants
                                would be required for another year on office-work to complete the
                                records of the survey, so that the probable expense which would be
                                incurred for completing the work might be set down at $325,000.</p>
                            <p>Officers of engineers have been frequently assigned to perform such
                                duties as these, and if the demarcation of this boundary should be
                                confided to them the estimate should be modified.</p>
                            <p>Very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

                                    undersigned has the honor to report that, by an act passed on
                                    the 22d May, 1868, (31 Vic., c. 61,) certain provisions were

                                    copy of which act is hereunto annexed. These provisions are
                                    taken very much from enactments previously existing in the late
                                    Province of Canada, (Consol. Stat., Canada, c. 62,) in Nova

                                <p>The undersigned has the honor further to state that his
                                    excellency the Governor General in council, on the 8th January
                                    last, was pleased to order, “That the system of granting fishing
                                    licenses to foreign vessels, under the act 31 Vic., c. 61, be
                                    discontinued, and that henceforth all foreign fishermen be
                                    prevented from fishing in the waters of Canada. Also, that six

                                    in Canada or hovering (in British waters) within three marine
                                    miles of any of the coasts, hays, creeks, or harbors in Canada,
                                    and stay on board so long as she may remain within such place or
                                    distance.</p>
                                <p>3. If such ship, vessel, or boat be bound elsewhere, and shall
                                    continue within such harbor, or so hovering for twenty-four
                                    hours after the master shall have been required to depart, any
                                    one of such officers or persons as are above mentioned may bring
                                    such ship, vessel, or boat into port and search her cargo, and
                                    may also examine the master upon oath touching the cargo and
                                    voyage; and if the master or person in command shall not truly
                                    answer the questions put to him in such examination, he shall
                                    forfeit four hundred dollars; and if such ship, vessel, or boat
                                    be foreign, or not navigated according to the laws of the United
                                    Kingdom or of Canada, and have been found fishing, or preparing
                                    to fish, or to have been fishing (in British waters) within
                                    three marine miles of any of the coasts, bays, creeks, or
                                    harbors of Canada, not included within the above-mentioned
                                    limits, without a license, or after the expiration of the period
                                    named in the last license granted to such ship, vessel, or boat
                                    under the first section of this act, such ship, vessel, or boat,
                                    and the tackle, rigging, apparel, furniture, stores, and cargo
                                    thereof shall be forfeited.</p>
                                <p>4. All goods, ships, vessels, and boats, and the tackle, rigging,
                                    apparel, furniture, stores, and cargo liable to forfeiture under
                                    this act, may be seized and secured by any officers or persons
                                    mentioned in the second section of this act; and every person
                                    opposing any officer or person in the execution of his duty
                                    under this act, or aiding or abetting any other person in any
                                    opposition, shall forfeit eight hundred dollars, and shall be
                                    guilty of a misdemeanor, and, upon conviction, be liable to
                                    imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years.</p>
                                <p>5. Goods, ships, vessels, and boats, and the tackle, rigging,
                                    apparel, furniture, stores, and cargo seized as liable to
                                    forfeiture under this act, shall be forthwith delivered into the
                                    custody of the collector or other principal officer of the
                                    customs at the port nearest to the place where seized, to be
                                    secured and kept as other goods, ships, vessels, and boats, and
                                    the tackle, rigging, apparel, furniture, stores, and cargo
                                    seized are directed by the laws in force in the province in
                                    which such port is situate to be secured and kept, or into such
                                    other custody and keeping as the governor in council, or a court
                                    of vice-admiralty shall order.</p>
                                <p>6. All goods, vessels, and boats, and the tackle, rigging,
                                    apparel, furniture, stores, and cargo, condemned as forfeited
                                    under this act, shall, by direction of the collector or other
                                    principal officer of the customs at the port where the seizure
                                    has been secured, be sold at public auction, and the proceeds of
                                    such sale shall be applied as follows: The amount chargeable for
                                    the custody of the property seized shall first be deducted and
                                    paid over for that service; one-half of the remainder shall be
                                    paid, without deduction, to the officer or person seizing the
                                    same; and the other half, after first deducting therefrom all
                                    costs incurred, shall be paid to the receiver general of Canada,
                                    through the department of marine and fisheries; but the governor
                                    in council may, nevertheless, direct that any ship, vessel, boat
                                    or goods, and the tackle, rigging, apparel, furniture, stores,
                                    and cargo seized and forfeited shall be destroyed, or be
                                    reserved for the public service.</p>
                                <p>7. Any penalty or forfeiture under this act may be prosecuted and
                                    recovered in any court of vice-admiralty within Canada.</p>
                                <p>8. The judge of the court of vice-admiralty may, with the consent
                                    of the person seizing any goods, ship, vessel, or boat, and the
                                    tackle, rigging, apparel, furniture, stores, and cargo, as
                                    forfeited under this act, order the redelivery thereof, on
                                    security by bond to be given by the party, with two sureties, to
                                    the use of her Majesty; and in case any goods, ship, vessel, or
                                    boat, or the tackle, rigging, apparel, furniture, stores, and
                                    cargo so redelivered is condemned as forfeited, the value
                                    thereof shall be paid into court and distributed as above
                                    directed.</p>
                                <p>9. Her Majesty’s attorney general for Canada may sue for and
                                    recover in her Majesty’s name any penality or forfeiture
                                    incurred under this act.</p>
                                <p>10. In case a dispute arises as to whether any seizure has or has
                                    not been legally made, or as to whether the person seizing was
                                    or was not authorized to seize under this act, oral evidence may
                                    be heard thereupon, and the burden of proving the illegality of
                                    the seizure shall be upon the owner or claimant.</p>
                                <p>11. No claim to anything seized under this act and returned into
                                    any court of viceadmiralty for adjudication shall be admitted
                                    unless the claim be entered under oath, with the name of the
                                    owner, his residence and occupation, and the description of the
                                    property claimed; which oath shall be made by the owner, his
                                    attorney or agent, and to the best of his knowledge and
                                    belief.</p>
                                <pb n="410" xml:id="pg_410" facs="0444"/>
                                <p>12. No person shall enter a claim to anything seized under this
                                    act until security has been given in a penalty not exceeding
                                    $240, to answer and pay costs occasioned by such claim; and in
                                    default of such security the things seized shall be adjudged
                                    forfeited, and shall be condemned.</p>
                                <p>13. No writ shall be sued out against any officer or other person
                                    authorized to seize under this act for anything done under this
                                    act, until one month after notice in writing delivered to him or
                                    left at his usual place of abode by the person intending to sue
                                    out such writ, his attorney, or agent, in which notice shall be
                                    contained the cause of action, the name and place of abode of
                                    the person who is to bring the action, and of his attorney or
                                    agent; and no evidence of any cause of action shall be produced
                                    except such as shall be contained in such notice.</p>
                                <p>14. Every such action shall be brought within three months after
                                    the cause thereof has arisen.</p>
                                <p>15. If, on any information or suit brought to trial under this
                                    act on account of any seizure, judgment shall be given for the
                                    claimant, and the judge or court shall certify on the record
                                    that there was probable cause of seizure, the claimant shall not
                                    recover costs, nor shall the person who made the seizure be
                                    liable to any indictment or suit on account thereof; and if any
                                    suit or prosecution be brought against any person on account of
                                    any seizure under this act, and judgment be given against him,
                                    and the court or judge shall certify that there was probable
                                    cause for the seizure, then the plaintiff, besides the thing
                                    seized or its value, shall not recover more than three and a
                                    half cents damages, nor any costs of suit, nor shall the
                                    defendant be fined more than twenty cents.</p>
                                <p>16. Any officer or person who has made a seizure under this act
                                    may, within one month after notice of action received, tender
                                    amends to the party complaining, or to his attorney or agent,
                                    and may plead such tender.</p>
                                <p>17. All actions for the recovery of penalties or forfeitures
                                    imposed by this act must be commenced within three years after
                                    the offense committed.</p>
                                <p>18. No appeal shall be prosecuted from any decree or sentence of
                                    any court touching any penalty or forfeiture imposed by this
                                    act, unless the inhibition be applied for and decreed within
                                    twelve months from the decree or sentence being pronounced.</p>
                                <p>19. In cases of seizure under this act, the governor in council
                                    may, by order, direct a stay of proceedings, and in cases of
                                    condemnation, may relieve from the penalty in whole or in part,
                                    and on such terms as may be deemed right.</p>
                                <p>20. The several provisions of this act shall apply to any foreign
                                    ship, vessel, or boat, in or upon the inland waters of Canada;
                                    and the provisions hereinbefore contained in respect to any
                                    proceedings in a court of vice-admiralty shall, in the case of
                                    any foreign ship, vessel, or boat in or upon the inland waters
                                    of Canada, apply to, and any penalty or forfeiture in respect
                                    thereof shall be prosecuted and recovered in one of the superior
                                    courts of the province within which such cause of prosecution
                                    may arise.</p>
                                <p>21. Neither the ninety-fourth chapter of the Revised Statutes of
                                    Nova Scotia, (third series,) “of the coast and deep-sea

                                    this act applies; and so much of the said chapter and of each of
                                    the said acts as makes provision for cases provided for by this
                                    act is hereby declared to be inapplicable to such cases.</p>

                            Prime Minister of the Dominion of Canada, accompanying the dispatch of
                            his excellency <pb n="411" xml:id="pg_411" facs="0445"/>the Governor
                            General, which paragraph is in the following language, to wit:</p>
                        <p>That the system of granting fishing license to foreign vessels, under the
                            act 31 Vic., cap. 61, he discontinued, <hi rend="italic">and that
                                henceforth all foreign fishermen be prevented from fishing in the

                        <p>The words underscored seem to contemplate an interference with rights

                            1818, which secures to American fishermen the right of fishing in
                            certain waters which are understood to be claimed at present as

                            Labrador, unless the same or any portion thereof be settled, in which
                            case it is not lawful for the said fishermen to dry or cure fish at such

                            elsewhere, and shall continue within such harbor or so hovering for
                            twenty-four hours after the master shall have been required to depart,

                            furniture, stores, and cargo liable to forfeiture under this act, may be
                            seized and secured by any officers or persons mentioned in the second
                            section of this act; and every person opposing any officer or person in
                            the execution of his duty under this act, or aiding or abetting any
                            other person in any opposition, shall forfeit eight hundred dollars, and
                            shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction be liable to
                            imprisonment <pb n="413" xml:id="pg_413" facs="0447"/>for a term not
                            exceeding two years. On the 8th of January, 1870, the Governor General
                            of the Dominion of Canada, in council, ordered that suitable sailing
                            vessels, similar to La Canadienne,” be chartered and equipped for the
                            service of protecting the Canadian in-shore fisheries against illegal
                            encroachments by foreigners, these vessels to be connected with the
                            police force of Canada, and to form a marine branch of the same. It is
                            understood that, by a change of the boundaries between Canada and
                            Labrador, the Canadian territory now includes Mount Joly and a portion
                            of the shore to the east thereof, which in the treaty of 1818 was
                            described as the southern coast of Labrador.</p>
                        <p>This municipal change of boundary does not, however, interfere with the
                            rights of American fishermen, as defined by the treaty, on that portion
                            of what was the southern coast of Labrador, east of Mount Joly.</p>

                                    22d April, 1870, from her Majesty’s minister at Washington,
                                    inclosing copy of a note which he received from Mr. Fish, in
                                    which he invites his attention to the first paragraph of the
                                    order in council of the 8th of January last, discontinuing the
                                    system of fishing licenses, and stating that Mr. Fish also made
                                    a verbal communication to him upon the same subject, and said
                                    that the phrase “waters of Canada” might be supposed to include
                                    some of those waters in which, by the treaty of 1818, American
                                    fishermen have a right to fish, but which, by an extension of
                                    the boundaries of Canada, may now be comprised within the
                                    “waters of Canada.”</p>
                                <p>Mr. Thornton states that he assured Mr. Fish of his conviction
                                    that the above-mentioned order in council has no intention of
                                    abridging any of the rights to which citizens of the United
                                    States are entitled by the treaty of 1818, and that he would
                                    call your excellency’s attention to the subject.</p>
                                <p>The committee have also had under consideration the annexed
                                    report, dated 28th <pb n="414" xml:id="pg_414" facs="0448"

                                <p>The minister of marine and fisheries has the honor to state, with
                                    reference to Mr. Thornton’s dispatch of the 22d instant,
                                    accompanied by a note from Mr. Secretary Fish, in which the
                                    latter calls attention to the first paragraph of the order in
                                    council of 8th January last, and expresses his apprehension of
                                    interference with certain fishing rights guaranteed to the
                                    United States by article one of the convention of 1818, that the
                                    wording of the minute of council referred to clearly shows, by
                                    providing for the prevention of “<hi rend="italic">illegal</hi>
                                    encroachment by foreigners” on the in-shore fisheries of Canada,
                                    that the Canadian government never contemplated any interference
                                    with rights secured to United States citizens by the treaty in
                                    question between the British and American governments.</p>
                                <p>Mr. Thornton was therefore quite right in assuring Mr. Fish, in
                                    general terms, that there could be no intention to abridge any
                                    rights to which citizens of the United States art entitled by
                                    treaty.</p>
                                <p>The undersigned remarks that Mr. Fish also labors under a
                                    misapprehension in supposing that the present boundaries of the
                                    Dominion comprise any fishing grounds affected by the existing
                                    treaty stipulations to which Mr. Fish’s note refers, which were
                                    not formerly within the bounds of the old province of Canada.
                                    With regard to the general effect of the first paragraph of the
                                    order in council of 8th January last, quoted at length, and
                                    underlined in Mr. Fish’s note, the undersigned would further
                                    observe that the act relating to fishing, by foreign vessels,
                                    under the authority of which licenses were issued to United
                                    States fishermen, applied to all foreigners; and as the
                                    discontinuance of the license system which had existed under it
                                    applies also to other foreign vessels and fishermen frequenting
                                    bur coasts, and who are not entitled to fish anywhere in the
                                    waters of Canada, the terms of such formal discontinuance were
                                    necessarily general, and in any case they could apply only to
                                    those waters within which our “in-shore fisheries” are situated,
                                    and in which neither American nor other foreign subjects have
                                    any legal right to fish.</p>
                                <p>The whole respectfully submitted.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> In Mr. Secretary Cardwell’s letter to
                                the lords commissioners of the admiralty of the 12th of April, 1866,
                                it was stated that American vessels should not be seized for
                                violating the Canadian fishing laws, “except after willful and
                                persevering neglect of the warnings which they may have received;
                                and in case it should become necessary to proceed to forfeiture,
                                cases should, if possible, be selected for that extreme step in
                                which the offense has been committed within three miles of
                                land.”</p>
                            <p>The Canadian government has recently determined, with the concurrence
                                of her Majesty’s ministers, to increase the stringency of the
                                existing practice of dispensing with the warnings hitherto given and
                                seizing at once any vessel detected in violating the law.</p>
                            <p>In view of this change and of the questions to which it may give
                                rise, I am directed by Lord Granville to request that you will move
                                their lordships to instruct the officers of her Majesty’s ships
                                employed in the protection of the fisheries that they are not to
                                seize any vessel unless it is evident and can be clearly proved that
                                the offense of fishing has been committed, and the vessel itself
                                captured within three miles of land.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have the honor to acknowledge your note
                            of 18th instant, addressed to Mr. Davis, inclosing a dispatch from the
                            Governor General of Canada, forwarding copy of a “minute of the privy
                            council,” and also a report of the minister of marine and fisheries,
                            dated 28th April last.</p>
                        <p>The reiteration in this respect of the assurance which you had previously
                            given, that there could be no intention on the part of the Dominion of
                            Canada to abridge any rights to which the citizens of the United States
                            are entitled by treaty, is in accordance with the confident expectation
                            of this Government.</p>
                        <p>It had, however, attracted the notice of the Government that, by an order
                            in council of 8th January last, it was ordered that “henceforth all
                            foreign fishermen be prevented from fishing in the waters of Canada.”
                            The question arose, What are the waters of Canada?</p>
                        <p>At the date of the treaty of 1818 the boundary of Canada, as understood,
                            was defined by the 27 chap. 49 George III, entitled “An act for
                            establishing courts of jurisdiction in the island of Newfoundland and
                            the islands adjacent, and for reannexing part of the coast of Labrador
                            and the islands lying on said coast to the government of Newfoundland,”
                            (March 30, 1809,) by the 14th section of which it was enacted “that such
                            parts of the coast of Labrador from the river Saint John to Hudson’s
                            Streights, and the said island of Anticosti, and all other smaller
                            islands so annexed to the government of Newfoundland by the said
                            proclamation of the seventh day of October, one thousand seven hundred
                            and sixty-three, (except the said islands of Madelaine,) shall be
                            separated from the said government of Lower Canada, and be again
                            reannexed to the government of Newfoundland.”</p>
                        <p>The mouth of the river Saint John, referred to in this act, is understood
                            to be between the 64th and 65th meridian of longitude west from
                            Greenwich.</p>
                        <p>We further understood that in June, 1825, by the 9th section of cap. 59,
                            6 George IV, entitled “An act to provide for the extinction of federal
                            and seigniorial rights and burthens in lands held <hi rend="italic">á
                                titre de tief</hi> and <hi rend="italic">á titre de cens,</hi> in
                            the province of Lower Canada, and for the gradual conversion of those
                            tenures into the tenure of free and common socage and for other purposes
                            relating to said province,” it was enacted that so much of the said
                            coast as lies to the westward of a line to be drawn due north and south
                            from the bay or harbor of Ance Sablon, inclusive, as far as the 52d
                            degree of north latitude, with the island of Anticosti, and all <pb
                                n="418" xml:id="pg_418" facs="0452"/>other islands adjacent to such
                            part as last aforesaid of the coast of Labrador, shall be, and the same
                            are hereby, reannexed to and made a part of the said province of Lower
                            Canada, and shall henceforward be subject to the laws of the said
                            province, and to none other.</p>
                        <p>The bay or harbor of Ance Sablon is understood to be in the longitude of
                            about 57° 8', at or near the entrance of the Straits of Belle Isle.</p>
                        <p>The treaty of 1818 secures to the inhabitants of the United States, in
                            common with the subjects of her Britannic Majesty, the liberty to take
                            fish of any kind on the shores of the Magdalen Islands, arid also on the
                            coasts, bays, harbors, and creeks from Mount Joly, on the southern coast
                            of Labrador, to and through the Straits of Belle Isle, and thence
                            northwardly, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Mount Joly, thus fixed by treaty as the westernmost limit on the coast of
                            Labrador of the liberty of fishing for the inhabitants of the United
                            States, is understood to be in the longitude of about 61° 40' From that
                            point eastward and northward, on the shores of what was then called
                            Labrador, the fishermen of the United States have the liberty to take
                            fish.</p>
                        <p>The act last above recited seems to establish the boundaries and the
                            jurisdiction of Canada as extending to the bay of Ance Sablon, about
                            four and a half degrees of longitude to the east of Mount Joly, and to
                            include the Magdalen Islands.</p>
                        <p>It was under the impression that this act establishes the jurisdiction
                            and the boundary of Canada, as extending to a line drawn due north and
                            south from the bay or harbor of Ance Sablon, and including the Magdalen
                            Islands, that on the 21st April last I invited your attention to the
                            first paragraph of the order in council of the Dominion of Canada on the
                            8th January last, declaring “that henceforth all foreign fishermen be
                            prevented from fishing in the waters of Canada,” as contemplating a
                            possible interference with the rights guaranteed to the United States
                            under the treaty of 1818. The minister of the privy council and the
                            report of the minister of marine and fisheries, of which you have given
                            me copies, give assurance of the intent of the authorities of the
                            Dominion government not to abridge those rights; but the order in
                            council may be interpreted by those to whom its execution is intrusted
                            to authorize their interference with fishermen of the United States
                            while in the exercise of their guaranteed liberty. If our understanding
                            that the boundary and jurisdiction of Canada extend to the bay or harbor
                            of Ance Sablon, and include the Magdalen Islands, be correct, “the
                            waters of Canada” embrace the coast of Labrador from Mount Joly to the
                            bay of Ance Sablon, and include also the Magdalen Islands. Desirous to
                            avoid the possibility of any misapprehension on the part of those who
                            may be charged with the execution of the order in council, I beg to call
                            your attention to the acts to which I have referred, and to request, in
                            case I am in error with regard to the eastern boundary and the extent of
                            jurisdiction in Canada, that you will advise me of the real boundary and
                            jurisdiction. If I am correct in this respect, and if that part of the
                            coast of what in 1818 was known as Labrador included between Mount Joly
                            and the bay or harbor of Ance Sablon, or the Magdalen Islands, be in
                            “the waters of Canada,” I do not doubt that the authorities of the
                            Dominion will recognize the necessity of such modification of the order
                            in council of the 8th of January last, or of such additional
                            instructions to be given as will secure the fishermen of the United
                            States from interference while in the exercise of the liberty guaranteed
                            to them by the treaty of 1818.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, with the highest consideration,</p>

                            receipt of your note of the 31st ultimo relative to the exception which
                            you took to the wording of the Canadian order in council of the 8th of

                        <p>I am inclined to think that you are right in supposing that the limit of
                            Canada extends as far east as Ance Sablon on the coast of Labrador, and
                            that the Magdalen Islands are comprised within it, for I am not aware
                            that any change has been made since the act of Parliament of 1825 quoted

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Lords: * * * * *</hi> Her Majesty’s
                                government are clearly of the opinion that by the convention of 1818
                                the United States have renounced the right of fishing, not only
                                within three miles of the colonial shores, but within three miles of
                                a line drawn across the mouth of any British bay or creek. But the
                                question, What is a British bay or creek? is one that has been the
                                occasion of difficulty in former times.</p>
                            <p>It is, therefore, at present, the wish of her Majesty’s government
                                neither to concede, nor, for the present, to enforce, any rights in
                                this respect which are, in their nature, open to any serious
                                question. Even before the conclusion of the reciprocity treaty, her
                                Majesty’s government had consented to forego the exercise of its
                                strict right to exclude American fishermen from the Bay of Fundy,
                                and they are of opinion that during the present season that right
                                should not be exercised in the body of the Bay of Fundy, and that
                                American fishermen should not be interfered with, either by notice
                                or otherwise, unless they are found within three miles of the shore,
                                or within three miles of a line drawn across the mouth of a bay or

                            receipt of your note of the 3d instant, and of the papers accompanying
                            it, giving the names of the British vessels to be employed in
                            maintaining order at the Canadian fisheries, and the instructions
                            proposed to be issued by Vice-Admiral Wellesley to the commanders of
                            those vessels.</p>
                        <p>I beg leave to point out to you and to her Majesty’s government an
                            apprehended discrepancy between the terms of the instructions thus
                            communicated and those which were given by the admiralty to the
                            vice-admiral, a copy of which, dated the 5th ultimo, accompanied your
                            note of the 26th ultimo, and which direct that “no vessel should be
                            seized, (meaning fishing vessels of the United States,) unless it is
                            evident and can be clearly proved that the offense of fishing has been
                            committed and that the vessel is captured within three miles of
                            land.”</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, I find with the instructions issued by Vice-Admiral
                            Wellesley, and forming a part of them, a letter marked <hi rend="italic"
                                >confidential</hi>, from the secretary of state for the colonies to
                            the lords of the admiralty, dated Downing street, April 2, 1866, in
                            which is expressed the opinion of her Majesty’s government, that the
                            United States have renounced the right of fishing within three miles of
                            a line drawn across the mouth of any British bay or creek, and also that
                            American fishermen should not be interfered with, either by notice or
                            otherwise, unless they are found within three miles of a line drawn
                            across the mouth of a bay or creek which is less than ten geographical
                            miles in width, in conformity with the arrangement made with France in
                            1839, and that American vessels found within these limits should be
                            warned that by engaging or preparing to engage in fishing they will be
                            liable to forfeiture, and should receive notice to depart.</p>
                        <p>The vice-admiral communicated a copy of these instructions, winch, he
                            proposed to issue immediately to the commander of the Plover, to the
                            secretary of the admiralty on the 27th of April last; and though it is
                            not doubted that on receipt of the later instruction addressed to him on
                            the 5th ultimo, by the lords commissioners of the admiralty, he will
                            modify the directions to his subordinates so that they will be in <pb

                            the admiralty, and without entering into any consideration of questions
                            which might be suggested by the letter referred to, which I understand
                            to be superseded by later instructions, I think it best to call your
                            attention to the inconsistencies referred to, in order to guard against
                            misunderstandings and complications that might arise in the absence of
                            modifications of the instructions communicated in your note of the 3d

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I had the honor to receive yesterday your
                            note of the 8th instant relative to an apparent discrepancy between the
                            instructions issued by Vice-Admiral Wellesley, inclosed in my note of
                            the 3d instant, and those given by the admiralty to him, which
                            accompanied my note of the 26th ultimo. You are, however, quite right in
                            not doubting that Admiral Wellesley, on the receipt of the later
                            instructions addressed to him on the 5th ultimo, will have modified the
                            directions to the officers under his command so that they may be in
                            conformity with the views of the admiralty. In confirmation of this I
                            have since received a letter from Vice-Admiral Wellesley, dated the 30th
                            ultimo, informing me that he had received instructions to the effect
                            that officers of her Majesty’s ships employed in the protection of the
                            fisheries should not seize any vessel unless it were evident, and could
                            be clearly proved, that the offense of fishing had been committed and
                            the vessel itself captured within three miles of land.</p>
                        <p>I avail myself at the same time of the opportunity to point out to you,
                            in compliance with an instruction which I have received from the Earl of
                            Clarendon, that the circular of the 16th ultimo of your honorable
                            colleague, the Secretary of the Treasury, respecting the Canadian
                            in-shore fisheries, may lead to future misunderstanding, inasmuch as it
                            limits the maritime jurisdiction of the Dominion of Canada to three
                            marine miles from the shores thereof, without regard to international
                            usage, which extends such jurisdiction over creeks and bays, or to the
                            stipulations of the treaty of 1818, in which the United States renounce
                            the right of fishing within three miles, not of the coast only, but of
                            the bays, creeks, or harbors of her Britannic Majesty’s dominions in
                            America.</p>

                            impression that Admiral Wellesley will have modified the directions to
                            the officers under his command engaged in the protection of the Canadian

                            out, under instructions from the lamented Earl of Clarendon, that the
                            circular of the 16th ultimo, issued by the Secretary of the Treasury of
                            the United States, respecting the Canadian in-shore fisheries, may lead
                            to further misunderstanding, inasmuch as it limits the maritime
                            jurisdiction of the Dominion of Canada to three marine miles, from the
                            shores thereof.</p>
                        <p>In view of the claims heretofore presented by her Majesty’s government,
                            and which, as it contends, are supported by the law of nations and the
                            stipulations of the treaty of 1818, as to the extent of British maritime
                            jurisdiction in the waters in which the fisheries are prosecuted on the
                            eastern coast of North America, the President is pleased to recognize in
                            the tenor of the dispatches and instructions which have been addressed
                            by her Majesty’s government to the Canadian authorities and to Admiral
                            Wellesley a generous spirit of amity, which is reciprocated by the
                            United States. Animated by that spirit, he directs that her Majesty’s
                            government be informed that the description of the limit of Canadian
                            maritime jurisdiction contained in the circular in question, and which
                            was adopted before this Government was made acquainted with the nature
                            of the instructions which it was proposed by her Majesty’s government to
                            issue, was used for the sake of brevity in expressing the interpretation
                            which has been heretofore placed upon the first article of the treaty of
                            1818 by this Government, and not with the expectation of renewing a
                            controversial discussion upon the subject, which, under present
                            circumstances, he would sincerely deprecate.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> While at Prince Edward Island a few days
                            since, I was informed by Mr. J. C. Hall, and other extensive fishermen
                            on that island, that they were daily expecting an order to the
                            commandants of her Majesty’s vessels cruising along that island,
                            forbidding American fishermen the privilege, heretofore long enjoyed by
                            American vessels, of entering its ports to dry fish, purchase supplies,
                            and to reship their fish for ports in the United States.</p>
                        <p>On my return yesterday I received from Mr. Hall a <hi rend="italic"
                                >letter</hi> and a copy of “The Patriot’’ upon that subject, which I
                            have the honor to inclose for the information of the Department.</p>
                        <p>The fishing interests of Prince Edward Island are mainly in American
                            hands. Mr. Hall informs me that of the twelve or fourteen thousand
                            barrels of mackerel annually shipped from there his firm ships eight
                            thousand barrels.</p>
                        <p>The islanders are quite largely interested in furnishing shippers with
                            supplies of barrels, salt, provisions, &amp;c., who will be nearly
                            ruined by a strict enforcement of the treaty of October 20, 1818.</p>
                        <p>One of the members of the Dominion government is freely quoted in the
                            island as having said that the government intended, by a strict
                            enforcement <pb n="423" xml:id="pg_423" facs="0457"/>of colonial rights,
                            to compel a reciprocity treaty with the United States.</p>
                        <p>I agree in opinion with the editor of “The Patriot” upon the probable
                            effect of such a policy.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be. very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

                                Majesty’s steamers Valorous and Plover have closed up all trade
                                privileges of landing mackerel in the ports of this island; ordered
                                off a Gloucester schooner this morning; would not allow her to take
                                her bait or supplies.</p>
                            <p>Her voyage is broken up, and she goes directly to Gloucester. This
                                Japanese policy has been sprung upon this island without a day’s
                                notice. As all ports of this gulf are now closed against our
                                fishermen, and as late in the season they cannot prosecute the
                                fisheries unless they can make use of the harbors at will, unless
                                something is done, our vessels must abandon these fishing grounds.
                                The island government would protect them had they the power. But
                                they are helpless. That the trade commercial regulations, including
                                the landing of mackerel, that have existed and been encouraged here
                                for the last six years, should be terminated at once, is, to say the
                                least of it, unfriendly to the last degree, and should receive the
                                immediate attention of our Government. The remedy is plain; close up
                                the shipment of goods in bond through the States to Canada. This
                                whole business has been one of a purely commercial character, and
                                the treaty of 1818, under which this outrage upon our fishermen is
                                justified, has no connection with it. The restriction then was to
                                prevent our fishermen from landing on the shores where there were no
                                ports, to cure and dry their fish, and to prevent illicit trade.
                                Here our fishermen enter and clear, and take out permit to land
                                their mackerel from the collector, and as their mackerel are a free
                                article in this island, there can be no illicit trade. I trust this
                                will receive the prompt attention of our Government.</p>
                            <p>Yours, truly,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inclose herewith two
                            numbers of the Halifax Morning Chronicle—a leading newspaper published
                            in this city— containing an editorial article, as well as extracts from
                            other provincial papers, relative to the recent action of the Canadian
                            and imperial authorities prohibiting the transshipment in bond from
                            Canadian and other provincial ports of American-caught fish.</p>
                        <p>This sudden prohibition of the bonding system, which has existed for
                            years without interruption, and which has been mutually beneficial to
                            the traders of both countries, evinces a determination on the part of
                            the Dominion and imperial authorities to throw every obstacle in the way
                            of American fishing vessels visiting for any purpose a Canadian or
                            colonial port.</p>
                        <p>It appears to me, in view of the unprecedented stringency of recent acts
                            of the Canadian parliament in reference to the fisheries, and the still
                            more unprecedented stringency with which those acts are attempted to be
                            enforced against American fishermen, at a time, too, when the policy of
                            modern nations favors a relaxation of the restrictions upon the deep-sea
                            fisheries, that our Government would be justified, while <pb n="424"

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I am in receipt of reliable information
                            from various parts of Cape Breton Island, that a very large majority of
                            our fishing vessels now in the waters near that island, and on the
                            fishing grounds north of it, are about to return to our own shores,
                            principally, although not solely, on account of the very strict and
                            literal construction, and not less strict enforcement, of the provisions
                            of the treaty of 1818, and the Canadian in-shore fishery laws. The
                            action of the Dominion government in this respect being calculated to
                            annoy and harass our fishermen without benefiting, if not seriously
                            injuring, the interests of the people of the maritime, provinces, seems
                            to confirm the declaration often made by members of the confederate
                            party, referred to in my dispatch No. 9, that their government intends
                            to retaliate for an alleged illiberal commercial policy on the part of
                            our Government; in other words, that they mean to coerce the United
                            States into a reduction of duties on Dominion goods.</p>
                        <p>Assuming this to be the case, it may be deserving of serious
                            consideration, whether the interests and dignity of the United States
                            would not be best consulted by not merely abstaining from any change of
                            our duties, which may have been intended, in favor of the Dominion of
                            Canada, but also by the withdrawal of such privileges as have heretofore
                            been extended to that country by our Government. As reflecting public
                            sentiment in this consular district on the fishery question, I beg to
                            call the attention of the Department to an article headed “Protection of
                            the fisheries,” on page 2 of the “Easton Chronicle,” of the 25th
                            instant, a copy of which I herewith transmit.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have the honor to inclose herewith
                            copies of a correspondence with Vice-Admiral George Greville Wellesley,
                            respecting supplies to American fishermen in colonial ports.</p>
                        <pb n="425" xml:id="pg_425" facs="0459"/>
                        <p>The contradictory reports in circulation in reference to the orders given
                            by the vice-admiral and the frequent applications made to me by American
                            citizens engaged in the ocean fisheries for information on the subject
                            rendered the correspondence necessary.</p>
                        <p>It will be seen by the vice-admiral’s communication that for the first
                            time since the treaty of peace in 1815 have the imperial authorities
                            prohibited ice, bait, or other supplies from being furnished in the
                            colonial ports to American fishermen engaged in the deep-sea or ocean
                            fisheries. And this prohibition, so extraordinary and unprecedented, was
                            neither announced nor enforced, either by the imperial or Dominion
                            authorities, until after the commencement of the fishing season, when
                            our vessels were on their voyages to the fishing grounds.</p>
                        <p>In my judgment the grounds upon which the prohibition is sought to be
                            justified by the vice-admiral are wholly untenable, and arise from a
                            total misconception of the objects, purposes, and intent of the treaty
                            of 1818. That treaty was adopted exclusively for the purpose of settling
                            certain differences and disputes between the United States and Great
                            Britain, respecting the “liberty claimed by the United States to take,
                            dry, and cure fish on certain coasts, bays, harbors, and creeks of her
                            Britannic Majesty’s dominions in America.” It made no reference to and
                            did not attempt to regulate the deep-sea fisheries, which were open to
                            all the world, and over which Great Britain had not, at the time of the
                            adoption of the treaty, and has not now, any more control than the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>It is obvious that the words “and for no other purpose whatever,” used in
                            the treaty of 1818, immediately after the clause declaring that “the
                            American fishermen shall be admitted to enter such bays or harbors for
                            the purpose of shelter and of repairing damages therein, of purchasing
                            wood and of obtaining water,” must be construed to apply solely to such
                            purposes as are in contravention of the treaty; namely, to purposes
                            connected with the taking, drying, or curing fish within three marine
                            miles of certain coasts, and not in any manner to supplies intended for
                            the ocean fisheries, with which the treaty had no connection; supplies
                            which ever have been and ever must be legitimate articles of trade and
                            commerce, and which cannot, it appears to me, be prohibited in a time of
                            peace, either by the imperial or Dominion authorities, without violating
                            the usages of civilized and enlightened nations.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                                receipt of your communication of yesterday, suggesting an
                                application to the Dominion authorities for the in formation which I
                                requested.</p>
                            <p>I addressed you under the impression that the imperial and Dominion
                                authorities were coöperating and acting under the same orders,
                                regulations, and instructions in reference to all matters connected
                                with the protection of the in-shore fisheries.</p>
                            <p>As American fishermen are almost daily visiting this port on their
                                way to the fishing banks, it becomes a matter of great importance to
                                them to know whether any orders have been issued by your excellency,
                                as the representative of the imperial government, to prevent them
                                from obtaining such supplies as have been customary, both before and
                                since the treaty of 1818, in all the ports of the British North
                                American provinces.</p>
                            <p>Since addressing you I have understood that the commanders of her
                                Majesty’s vessels, acting under the authority of your excellency,
                                have notified American fishermen bound to the fishing banks that
                                they would not be permitted to procure ice or other supplies in any
                                of the colonial ports, and that any attempt to procure such supplies
                                would subject their vessels and cargoes to seizure and
                                confiscation.</p>
                            <p>As consul of the United States I am frequently applied to by American
                                citizens engaged in the deep-sea fisheries for information on this
                                subject. To enable me to give such information I have respectfully
                                to request you to furnish me with copies of any orders issued by
                                your excellency in relation to supplies to American fishermen.</p>

                            <p>Although it is not within the scope of my authority to furnish you
                                with these documents, I may state in general terms, which will
                                probably be sufficient for the purpose you have in view, that the
                                duty enjoined on the commanding officers of her Majesty’s ships is
                                to prevent any infringement of the arrangements agreed on between
                                the two governments in respect of the fisheries in the treaty of
                                1818. That treaty expressly defines the purposes for which alone
                                United States fishing vessels are to be allowed to enter ports
                                within certain limits. The words used are as follows:</p>
                            <p>“<hi rend="italic">Provided</hi>, <hi rend="italic">however,</hi>
                                That the American fishermen shall be admitted to enter such bays or
                                harbors for the purpose of shelter and repairing damages therein, of
                                purchasing wood and of obtaining water, and for no other purpose
                                whatever. But they shall be under such restrictions as may be
                                necessary to prevent their taking, drying, or curing fish therein,
                                or in any other manner whatever abusing the privileges hereby
                                reserved to them.”</p>
                            <p>It appears to me that the expression “for no other purpose whatever”
                                excludes them from procuring ice, bait, or other supplies, and the
                                officers have, therefore, in my judgment, properly notified American

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> It is understood that the government of
                            the Dominion of Canada is prohibiting vessels of the United States from
                            entering ports under its jurisdiction for the purpose of leaving fish in
                            bond, and subsequently reshipping them. It is desirable to be informed
                            whether the practice referred to was not permitted previous to the late
                            reciprocity treaty; also, whether American fishing vessels were admitted
                            to the ports of entry of the British North American provinces for that
                            or any other purpose prior to the date of that treaty; and if any
                            colonial law existed under which this was prohibited, whether any
                            prosecutions for its violation have taken place, and with what
                            result.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your dispatch No. 20, and to state in answer that after
                            thorough investigation I have come to the conclusion that American
                            fishing vessels have not entered this port, prior to date of the late
                            reciprocity treaty, for the purpose of leaving fish in bond, and
                            afterward reshipping them, or for any other purpose but that of
                            obtaining wood, water, or shelter, and of being repaired. I have,
                            however, been informed that our fishing vessels were in the habit, prior
                            to the date of that, treaty, of entering the port of Charlotte Town,
                            Prince Edward Island, in order to purchase supplies and to leave fish in
                            bond to be subsequently reshipped.</p>
                        <p>According to general report, our fishing vessels were also in the habit
                            at that time of buying provisions, and even lead and salt, at different
                            points in the Strait of Can so, but could not leave their fish in bond,
                            there being no port of entry established in the strait before the date
                            of the reciprocity treaty.</p>
                        <p>The local laws of the province, in force at the time referred to, in
                            regard to bonded warehouses, do not prohibit the landing of fish in <pb
                                n="428" xml:id="pg_428" facs="0462"/>bond for reshipment. Whether
                            the local laws, concerning in-shore fisheries prior to the date of the
                            reciprocity treaty, contain any provisions pretending to interpret the
                            convention of 1818, 1 am as yet unable to say, as the revised statutes
                            of Nova Scotia do not enumerate obsolete or repealed laws, and as the
                            session laws that I have so far been able to collect, going back to
                            1840, do not contain acts referring to the subject.</p>
                        <p>The best lawyers in the country have no knowledge of any local
                            legislation on the subject, nor of any prosecutions against our fishing
                            vessels, except for alleged fishing within the prohibited boundary.</p>
                        <p>I shall not remit my exertions to obtain fuller information, and to make
                            a supplementary report at the earliest day practicable.</p>

                            inquiries contained in your dispatch No. 256, in reference to the
                            fisheries, to submit the following report:</p>
                        <p rend="center">FISHERY LAWS.</p>
                        <p>The existing laws relating to the fisheries consist of the treaty of
                            1818, between the United States and Great Britain; the imperial act
                            framed June 14, 1819, for the purpose of carrying the provisions of the
                            treaty into effect; the British North American act framed March 29,
                            1867, giving authority to the Canadian government over the sea-coast and
                            inland fisheries; and the Dominion acts framed respectively May 22,
                            1868, and May 12, 1870, relating to fishing by foreign vessels.</p>
                        <p>All these acts, Canadian as well as imperial, purport to be founded upon
                            the treaty of 1818, and designed to enforce its provisions. Some of the
                            provisions of the colonial acts respecting the fisheries are borrowed
                            from imperial statutes relating to trade and navigation, and although
                            enacted to protect the in-shore fisheries, are not strictly applicable
                            to fishing vessels.</p>
                        <p rend="center">SUPPLIES.</p>
                        <p>In no act is there any prohibition against fishing vessels visiting
                            colonial ports for supplies. The silence of all the acts upon this
                            point, and the practice of more than half a century under imperial laws,
                            framed expressly for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions
                            of the treaty, justify the conclusion that no such prohibition was
                            contemplated by it. This view of the subject derives additional support
                            from the fact that at the time of the adoption of the treaty the
                            mackerel fishing; as now carried on, was comparatively unknown.</p>
                        <p>During the intervening years between 1818 and 1870, throughout all the
                            controversies between the United States and Great Britain on the subject
                            of the fisheries, no question until the present had arisen in reference
                            to supplies. They were always readily procured in colonial ports, and
                            the trade being profitable to the people of the colonies, was
                            facilitated by the local authorities.</p>
                        <pb n="429" xml:id="pg_429" facs="0463"/>
                        <p>The controversies which preceded the adoption of the reciprocity treaty
                            related principally to our right to fish in certain bays, and to the
                            exact limits within which American fishermen, by the convention of 1818,
                            were entitled to fish on the coasts of British North America.</p>
                        <p>The rights insisted upon by citizens of the United States were
                            practically decided in their favor by the commissioners appointed under
                            the convention of 1853, between the United States and Great Britain, in
                            the case of the schooner Washington. That schooner, while fishing in the
                            Bay of Funday in 1843, ten miles distant from the shore, was seized by
                            the British authorities, taken into Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, and there
                            condemned for a violation of the fishery laws.</p>
                        <p>In 1853, after the adoption of the reciprocity treaty, the case was
                            brought before the commissioners on a claim of the owners of the
                            schooner for damages; and after a full and careful examination was
                            decided in favor of the claimants, to whom damages were awarded for the
                            illegal seizure and condemnation. Since that time what is termed the
                            “headland” interpretation of the treaty, theretofore at different times
                            insisted upon by Great Britain, and uniformly opposed by the United
                            States, if not actually abandoned, has been held in abeyance, and it is
                            not probable that any questions will hereafter arise in relation to it
                            between the two countries.</p>
                        <p>In regard to fishing supplies, the practice which has so long prevailed
                            of procuring them in colonial ports, with the full knowledge and consent
                            of both governments, whose citizens have mutually shared in the benefits
                            resulting from such pracitice, must be regarded as a practical
                            construction given to the treaty which concludes all parties.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">transshipment in bond.</hi></p>
                        <p>Since the abrogation of the reciprocity treaty until within a few weeks
                            past, it had been the practice of the colonial authorities to permit the
                            transshipment in bond of American-caught fish. The practice was founded
                            upon no statutory enactment, but was adopted as a commercial regulation,
                            mutually beneficial to our fishermen and the people of the provinces. It
                            afforded facilities to the former in the prosecution of a lawful and
                            useful avocation, and increased the trade and contributed to the
                            prosperity of the latter. While its discontinuance, in itself, violates
                            no established commercial usage between friendly nations, as in the case
                            Of the prohibition of supplies to our fishermen, yet the <hi
                                rend="italic">time</hi> of its discontinuance, in the midst of the
                            fishing season, without previous notice, and when much greater and more
                            important bonding privileges were, and still are, extended by the United
                            States to the British colonies, is a just cause of complaint.</p>

                        <p>While fresh fish, the product of the British North American fisheries, is

                        <p>To subject fishing vessels coming into colonial ports, as is now the
                            case, to the compulsory regulations respecting pilotage applied to
                            merchant vessels, and at the same time to deny them when in port the
                            ordinary privileges extended to such merchant vessels, is manifestly
                            unjust.</p>

                        <p rend="center">BURDEN OF PROOF CHANGED.</p>
                        <p>The Dominion act framed in 1868 reverses, in violation of the principles
                            of the common law, the ordinary modes of proof, and declares, in section
                            ten, that “in case a dispute arises as to whether any seizure has or has
                            not been legally made, or as to whether the person seizing was or was
                            not authorized to seize under the act, the burden of proving the
                            illegality of the seizure shall be upon the owner or claimant.” Under
                            this section an American fishing vessel coming into port in the exercise
                            of a conceded and unrestricted treaty right, either for the purpose of
                            shelter, of repairing damages therein, of purchasing wood, and obtaining
                            water, and unlawfully seized, instead of being presumed to be in port
                            for a lawful purpose, is presumed by the act of seizure itself, however
                            unauthorized, to be guilty of a violation of the fishery laws. Thus the
                            presumption of guilt, which is to subject a fishing vessel to seizure
                            and confiscation, is made, in the first instance, to depend upon the
                            caprice of the seizing officer, and not upon the conduct of the officers
                            and crew of the captured vessel. It is obvious that such a rule of
                            action must be instrumental in inflicting wrong and injury upon innocent
                            and unoffending parties.</p>
                        <p rend="center">STRAIT OF CANSO.</p>
                        <p>It has been intimated that still further restrictions will be imposed
                            upon our fishermen, and that an attempt will be made to exclude them
                            from the Strait of Canso. This appears to me incredible, in view of
                            established principles of international law and the usage which has so
                            long prevailed.</p>
                        <p>Wheaton, in his Elements of International Law, says: “Straits are
                            passages communicating from one sea to another. If the navigation of the
                            two seas thus connected is free, the navigation of the channel by which
                            they are connected ought also to be free. Even if such strait be bounded
                            on both sides by the territory of the same sovereign, and is, at the
                            same time, so narrow as to be commanded by cannon-shot from both shores,
                            the exclusive territorial jurisdiction of that sovereign over such
                            strait is controlled by the right of other nations to communicate with
                            the seas thus connected.” And he holds that “the principle on which the
                            right to navigate straits depends is, that they are accessorial to those
                            seas which they unite, and the right of navigating which is not
                            exclusive but common to all nations, the right to navigate the seas
                            drawing after it that of passing the straits.”</p>
                        <p>The Strait of Canso for more than a century has been open as a public
                            highway to the vessels of all friendly nations. It formerly separated
                            French from English territory, and after the restoration of Cape Breton
                            to England by the capture of Louisburg in 1745, through the aid of
                            troops from Massachusetts, it was kept open to the commerce of the
                            world. Afterward, when Cape Breton, in 1820, ceased to be a separate
                            English colony, and was united to and became a part of Nova Scotia,
                            within whose territorial limits it then became included, the strait
                            still remained open, as a public highway, to the vessels of every
                            nation, and has since continued without interruption, and still
                            continues to be used and enjoyed as a general thoroughfare by American
                            vessels in common with vessels from other countries.</p>
                        <p>After such a dedication of this strait to maritime and commercial uses by
                            the French, English, and colonial authorities, and after our vessels
                            have pursued their fishing voyages through it for more than a century,
                            our right to navigate it cannot now be questioned.</p>

                            port.</hi></p>
                        <p>The manner in which the fishery laws are now construed and attempted to
                            be enforced by the Dominion authorities, if acquiesced in would amount
                            to a practical exclusion of our fishing vessels from colonial ports;
                            for, although their right to enter for the purpose of “shelter,
                            repairing damages, purchasing wood and obtaining water,” is guaranteed
                            by solemn treaty, yet, no sooner do they now enter, than, contrary to
                            all former practice, they are required to depart even before it is
                            ascertained for what purpose and under what circumstances they resort
                            thither.</p>
                        <p>While authority is given to certain officers, both imperial and Canadian,
                            to seize any American fishing vessel “found within three marine miles of
                            any of the coasts, bays, creeks, or harbors in Canada,” which, after
                            examination, “has been found fishing or preparing to fish, or to have
                            been fishing in British waters,” yet nothing in any of the acts
                            respecting the fisheries warrants this summary exclusion of such vessel
                            from port, or prohibits any vessel from entering as well for the purpose
                            of procuring supplies, as for shelter, repairs, wood, and water. On the
                            contrary, the fishery laws themselves, as well as the regulations
                            respecting pilotage, recognize the right of foreign fishing vessels
                            freely to enter the ports of the British North American provinces.</p>
                        <p>The rigorous measures now for the first time adopted, which materially
                            affect the interests of a large class of American citizens engaged in
                            the prosecution of an important branch of industry, while deriving no
                            sanction from the treaty of 1818, or the usages of nations, are rendered
                            still more objectionable from having been undertaken without notice
                            previously given, either by the Canadian minister of marine and
                            fisheries, by the collectors of colonial customs, or by the vice-admiral
                            in command of her Majesty’s fleet in the British North American waters.
                            In consequence of which, American fishing vessels, on their voyages to
                            the Grand Banks, have been seized in colonial waters, and, in subversion
                            of every principle of right or justice, subjected to confiscation under
                            some previously unknown order. Our fishermen can better endure hardship
                            and peril than wrong and injustice.</p>
                        <p>Our fisheries furnish a nursery for a vigorous and energetic race of
                            seamen in time of peace, and effectively add to our naval strength in
                            time of war; and the enterprising and intrepid men engaged in them—
                            whose employment is as hazardous to themselves as beneficial to the
                            nation—should be encouraged by the liberality and protected by the power
                            of the republic.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> Several seizures of American fishing
                            vessels are reported by the consular officers within your consulate
                            general, and by the parties interested. Some of the vessels thus seized
                            upon the charge of violating <pb n="432" xml:id="pg_432" facs="0466"
                            />the laws of the Dominion of Canada, or the other British North
                            American provinces, have been taken into port for adjudication by the
                            tribunals to which that function is assigned by the laws of the
                            respective provinces. It is to be presumed that those tribunals will
                            decide the cases respectively with intelligence and impartiality. It is
                            the duty of the owners of the vessels to defend their interests before
                            the courts at their own expense and without special assistance from the
                            Government in the present stage of affairs. It is for those tribunals to
                            construe the statutes under which they act. If the construction they may
                            adopt shall appear to be in contravention of our treaties with Great
                            Britain, or to be (which cannot be anticipated) plainly erroneous in a
                            case admitting no reasonable doubt, it will then become the duty of the
                            Government—a duty it will not be slow to discharge—to avail itself of
                            all necessary means for obtaining redress. The present embarrassment is,
                            that while we have reports of several seizures upon grounds as stated by
                            the interested parties, which seem to be in contravention of
                            international law and special treaties relating to the fisheries, these
                            alleged causes of seizure are regarded as pretensions of over-zealous
                            officers of the British navy and the colonial vessels, which will, as we
                            hope and are bound in courtesy to expect, be repudiated by the courts
                            before which our vessels are to be brought for adjudication. It is the
                            desire of this Government, nevertheless, that our consular officers
                            should watch the course of proceeding in these cases, and give prompt
                            and authentic information of any decision which may be made in them. In
                            particular if the charge against any American fishing vessel is only
                            that she has been preparing to fish, without actual fishing in the
                            prohibited limits, it is to be made known to the counsel of the owners
                            of the vessel that this Government is not disposed to regard such mere
                            preparation as an infraction of the obligations of our citizens engaged
                            in the outfit and employment of fishing vessels, and it is desirous of
                            having the point distinctly presented and adjudicated, if possible,
                            without being complicated with other questions, so that if adversely
                            decided, a case presenting that single issue may be made for appeal to
                            the British tribunal of last resort. It is understood that the
                            instructions of the imperial government of Great Britain do not
                            authorize the capture of an American vessel <hi rend="italic">found
                                fishing</hi> within three miles of the coasts from which they are
                            prohibited, or of a line drawn across the mouths of bays whose mouths do
                            not exceed six geographical miles in width. In any case of condemnation
                            it is desirable to have it appear with precision as well whether the
                            vessel condemned was fishing within the prohibited distance, as whether
                            the actual capture was made within that distance or beyond it, so as to
                            be upon the high seas, in the sense which this Government is disposed to
                            attach to these words, for the purpose of questions arising out of the
                            operations of our fishing vessels on the northeastern coast.</p>
                        <p>In short, without incurring any expense in the employment of counsel till
                            further instructed, it is expected that our consular officers in the
                            districts where trials may take place of American vessels for supposed
                            violations of the laws of the British imperial or colonial governments
                            will lend their countenance and aid to the parties interested, and give
                            prompt information of any decisions which may be made. They will
                            request, in courteous terms, of the proper officer of any court making a
                            decison, a certified copy of the opinion which may be written in the
                            cause, paying the proper fee therefor, which will be allowed in their
                            quarterly accounts, and forward it with the least possible delay.</p>
                        <p>This Department has expected such information from the spontaneous
                            activity of our consular officers, and attributes the absence of it to
                            the <pb n="433" xml:id="pg_433" facs="0467"/>provincial courts being now
                            in vacation. If this is the fact, I shall be glad to be informed of the
                            dates at which the respective courts, having jurisdiction in the
                            premises, may be expected to convene for the dispatch of business.</p>
                        <p>You will call the attention of all the consuls in your jurisdiction to
                            the contents of this instruction, who are located at points where
                            vessels will be likely to be taken in for adjudication.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of
                            your dispatch of the 29th ultimo, in reference to the seizure of
                            American fishing vessels off the coast of Nova Scotia and Prince Edward
                            Island.</p>
                        <p>Upon the receipt of your telegram of the 28th ultimo, I sent a dispatch
                            to all the consuls in the maritime provinces, calling their attention to
                            their duty to report on cases of seizure by telegraph, and also in
                            writing by mail.</p>
                        <p>Upon the receipt of yours of the 29th, which came to hand yesterday, I
                            caused copies to be at once prepared, and despatched the same by mail,
                            accompanied by a letter to each, of which the inclosed is a copy. Two,
                            at least, of the important consuls, that at Halifax and St. John, are
                            now absent on leave from the Department, and I fear their deputies may
                            not be as accurate in collecting information as the consuls would have
                            been if at home.</p>
                        <p>It seems to me that the unfriendly construction given by the Dominion
                            government of the treaty of 1818 was intensified in its harshness by the
                            almost covert manner in which it was sought to be enforced. It was with
                            the greatest difficulty that our consuls could ascertain from the
                            commanders of the various armed vessels what they would consider cause
                            for seizure and condemnation.</p>
                        <p>No adequate or suitable notice was given to the captains of American
                            fishing vessels, and they were seized for acts which they had been
                            permitted to do from time immemorial, as well before as subsequently to
                            the above-mentioned treaty.</p>
                        <p>Information has come to me from so many sources of declarations made by
                            the various ministers of the Dominion government, that I cannot doubt,
                            and it is openly proclaimed here and believed to be true, that the
                            enforcement of the above-mentioned treaty, in the manner it has been
                            enforced, has two objects, viz.: one of which is to create a Canadian
                            sentiment in antagonism to the United States, with a view to check the
                            spread of American sentiment here looking to ultimate annexation; the
                            other object is, by the close control of the fishing interests to compel
                            the United States, through her interests, to make a treaty of
                            reciprocity of trade between the United States and the British provinces
                            in North America.</p>
                        <p>The prevention of our vessels from purchasing supplies in Nova Scotia and
                            Prince Edward Island is injuring the trade and commerce of those <pb
                                n="434" xml:id="pg_434" facs="0468"/>points, while the Dominion
                            government is deriving no corresponding advantage.</p>
                        <p>But a small fraction of the fish taken there is taken by the Canadians,
                            and the exclusion of the people of the United States from there will not
                            be likely, in view of the character of the inhabitants, and the duty
                            upon fish, if maintained, to increase the number of Canadian
                            fishermen.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I transmit herewith a copy of a
                                communication which I have just received from the Department of
                                State, giving its views and wishes in reference to the seizure of
                                American vessels for alleged violation of the treaties and laws
                                passed in pursuance to them, regulating the fishing trade between
                                the United States and the British North American provinces. I had
                                supposed that the consuls within whose districts seizures have been
                                made had kept the Department fully advised of each seizure and the
                                ground upon which they were respectively made. I fear this duty has
                                been neglected, which is much to be regretted considering the large
                                interests involved, and the delicate and important questions that
                                may arise. The neglect should be remedied at once and fully.</p>
                            <p>You will please report at your earliest opportunity what vessels have
                                been seized, the date of seizure resspectively, upon what alleged
                                grounds, and what disposition has been made of the vessel. If a
                                libel of information has been filed in the admiralty court, obtain a
                                copy of it and transmit it to the Department. State when the courts
                                commenced session, or when they will hold a session at which the
                                several cases of seizure will be tried. Consult freely with the
                                attorneys for the claimants of the several vessels and make yourself
                                familiar with the precise points which have arisen or will be likely
                                to arise in each case, and with great care to accuracy, and transmit
                                that information to the Department of State, and in cases where
                                condemnation has already been had, procure and send to the
                                Department the opinion of the judge condemning it; and it would be
                                well, in case a vessel were released, to procure and send a like
                                opinion.</p>
                            <p>You should keep the Department as freely and accurately advised of
                                all these cases of seizure as a lawyer would his client in the
                                progress and determination of an important suit.</p>
                            <p>Very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

                                situate out of the united kingdom, and shall not qualify an alien
                                for any office or for any municipal, parliamentary, or other
                                franchise. 2. That this section shall not entitle an alien to any
                                right or privilege as a British subject, except such rights and
                                privileges in respect of property as are hereby expressly given to

                                foreign state to the effect that the subjects or citizens of that
                                state who have been naturalized as British subjects may divest

                                has been entered into by her Majesty; and from and after the date of

                                citizen of the state referred to in such order, who has been
                                naturalized as a British subject, may, within such limit of time as
                                may be provided in the convention, make a declaration of alienage,
                                and from and after the date of his so making such declaration such
                                person shall be regarded as an alien, and as a subject of the state
                                to which he originally belonged, as aforesaid.</p>
                            <p>A declaration of alienage may be made as follows, that is to say: If

                                of quieting doubts as to the right of such person to be a British

                                the certificate as in the case of a certificate of naturalization,
                                and an oath of alligiance shall in like manner be required

                                nationality has been granted shall, from the date of the certificate

                                laws thereof, or in pursuance of a treaty to that effect.</p>

                            forward a paper which I have prepared on brigandage in Greece, a subject
                            to which recent events have attracted public attention at home and
                            abroad. This must be my excuse for asking your kind perusal of the facts
                            presented.</p>

                                condition of brigandage in greece.</hi></p>
                        <p>The exceptional and trying position in which Greece stands with regard to
                            brigandage is not ameliorated by the diversity of views expressed by
                            foreign governments and foreign journals as to its character and the
                            means for its eradication. These is but one point of perfect unanimity,
                            namely, that brigandage is an unmitigated evil, and in this opinion
                            Greece agrees with all the world. There is no public man, scholar,
                            shopkeeper, or artisan in the kingdom who will deny that his country is
                            disgraced and her interests injured by this plague spot in their midst.
                            Every ministry, in turn, whatever amount of opprobrium is justly or
                            unjustly cast upon it for inefficiency or corruption, honestly laments
                            the existence of brigandage, and would heartily rejoice at its
                            termination. It is not, therefore, because Greece does not feel that it
                            is an infliction that the evil is not removed. Only those who are the
                            greatest sufferers by it comprehend the exact position of the case, and
                            the difficulties which surround it. Some of these difficulties may be
                            briefly stated.</p>
                        <p>Brigandage in Greece is not the child of to-day; it was born of Turkish
                            oppression, when restless men fled to the mountains to secure the only
                            independence vouchsafed them. Although the outlaw who now takes
                            advantage of impenetrable defiles of the mountains to evade pursuit is
                            without that nobility of character which the ancient Kleft possessed, he
                            has the same strategy and cunning, and from the same mountain fastnesses
                            can defy the pursuit of any soldiers but those accustomed to the
                            configuration of the land. Hence the absurdity of the proposition
                            sometimes made by foreign writers that marines from the ships of war
                            stationed at the Piraeus, or detachments of French or English soldiers,
                            should be sent into the mountains of the Morea and of Attica to
                            exterminate brigandage. An army might scour the kingdom and find not a
                            single brigand, Even if it effected a surprise and brought on a
                            conflict, more soldiers than brigands would probably fall, and the
                            nucleus of the band would escape to reappear in an unsuspected locality,
                            reënforced and more formidable than if they had never been interfered
                            with. The brigands are wandering bands; to-day in the Taygettres,
                            to-morrow in the Parnes; now alarming the peaceful farmers in Acaruania;
                            again threatening the excursionist in the public roads of Attica. From
                            place to place they move with a rapidity acquired only by years of
                            experience in a life which finds stimulus and excitement in the dangers
                            which surround them.</p>
                        <p>It is true that many of the bands are, so to speak, “localized” in
                            well-known spots. They are known, not only to the government, in name
                            and person, but mingle at times freely with the people of the villages
                            in this vicinity. They give money to the peasants, and from the latter
                            receive warning and even protection in case of pursuit.</p>
                        <p>Herein lies one of the chief elements of difficulty in the question of
                            brigandage. The peasants of a distant village, or the wandering
                            shepherds of Wallachia, who feed their flocks in Northern Greece, any
                            who may be at any time intruded upon by these mountain outlaws, have no
                            other choice but submission to their authority. Certainly, to oppose it
                            would be their worst policy; revenge in some shape would be certain to
                            follow. They therefore treat them as friends; supply them, if required,
                            with food; and, to secure their own safety, never betray them. Thus a
                            sort of forced fellowship exists between these two classes, and the
                            brigand becomes the patron of the harmless and industrious agricultural
                            community. Oftentimes it happens that the brigand has relatives among
                            the villagers, and then the tie becomes indissoluble. But the most
                            serious complication is found in the undeniable fact that certain
                            politicians court the favor of brigand chiefs to further their own
                            ambitious ends. The leaders of bands inhabiting country districts and
                            friendly to the people around them, and with whom, as has been
                            explained, there exists a sort of mutual dependence, are found extremely
                            useful in seasons of political excitement. The candidate for election to
                            the chamber of deputies finds it for his interest to keep on good terms
                            with one who can with such facility do him good or do him injury. He
                            knows that if he denounces the outlaw without the ability to crush him,
                            he, his family, or his property, will some time or other pay the penalty
                            of this courageous step. He finds that he has nothing to gain and
                            everything to lose by stirring in such a matter, and if he contents
                            himself with simple neutrality, his political opponent, who is less
                            scrupulous, will secure the brigand’s services and win the day. Few men
                            in a community so recently emerged from foreign oppression and the worst
                            condition of oriental corruption are sufficiently independent and
                            patriotic to shake off these contaminating influences. Thus it happens
                            that the brigand, who, in spite of his bad name, is practically known
                            only in the community around him as a reckless and good-natured
                            adventurer, mingles in the crowd at the polls, and influences his
                            acquaintances and friends to vote for his patron. Nothing could be more
                            demoralizing, nothing more humiliating to a free and self-governing
                            people. But until older and more enlightened nations are free from the
                            disgrace of employing corrupt means to further political ends, the stone
                            should be thrown lightly at the heads of the Greek people because some
                            among them feed their personal ambition with such unlawful
                            sustenance.</p>
                        <p>If the politician and the peasant of the mountain districts finds it for
                            his interest or <pb n="441" xml:id="pg_441" facs="0475"/>safety to bear
                            with the outlaw, the landholder finds it equally the part of policy to
                            conciliate him. The proprietor of an estate would be unworldly wise to
                            expose his people to capture and his property to robbery by refusing to
                            give bread and meat to a wandering band of suspicious characters who are
                            reported by his servants to be concealed in his grounds. Still wiser is
                            he if, by giving a few thousand drachmes per year to the leaders of
                            bands who haunt the vicinity, lie can secure permanent immunity from
                            danger. If he could rid himself and the country from this pest by
                            betraying the brigands to the Government, he would surely do it; but as
                            it is by no means certain that the soldiers sent against them would be
                            even partially successful, he prefers the alternative of discretion.
                            This is why men known for their respectability and moral worth, in
                            Athens and elsewhere, find themselves forced to do that which is nothing
                            more nor less than an encouragement to one of the vilest of public
                            crimes. The police annals of most cities will show that this system of
                            black mail is not confined to brigandage in Greece. There are those who
                            propose that, as a preliminary step to the rooting out of the evil of
                            brigandage, all those who, in any way, directly or indirectly,
                            contribute to the support of the outlaw, shall be prosecuted and
                            punished. In the most important instances it would be extremely
                            difficult, if not impossible, to prove the fact. From the very character
                            of the transactions they are necessaily conducted with the greatest
                            privacy. The party who paid the tribute would not betray himself, and
                            the last man to violate the secret would be the brigand, whose code of
                            “honor” is stronger than the written law.</p>
                        <p>It might be found, too, that the largest sums which find their way into
                            the pockets of outlaws from such sources are paid, not by Greeks, but by
                            foreigners, whose pecuniary interest in Greece induce them to pay this
                            easy premium on life and property assurance. The more closely that this
                            matter is examined the more intricate is found to be the web of its
                            solution. It is entwined about the political, social, and commercial
                            structure, and although repeatedly swept away, the creative cause
                            continues to exist in spite of judicial action and the ceaseless
                            complaint of public opinion.</p>
                        <p>The Greeks assert that brigandage has more than once been exterminated,
                            and that nothing but the inefficiency of this ministry or the complicity
                            of that one causes the reappearance of the scourge. Experience has
                            shown, however, that political circumstances are more at fault than
                            individuals in this matter. The brigand is a restless character, and
                            danger and adventure have charms for him. A revolution at home or the
                            prospect of a war with the Turks finds him on hand ready to join the mob
                            in the city or the army in the field; and in case of conflict he will be
                            found among the bravest of his fellows. So it happened that many of
                            these men enlisted as soldiers to assist in the Cretan insurrection, and
                            others came down from the mountains during the late imbroglio between
                            Greece and Turkey in the hope of finding profitable, or at least lawful
                            employment. With the disappearance of the war-cloud the brigand either
                            returns to his mountain haunt or for months hangs about the country with
                            that mischievous indefiniteness of purpose which forbodes evil; for his
                            person is unsafe from arrest, and if he would, he could not with
                            impunity take up any industrial pursuit. Such epochs are sure to be
                            followed by open acts of brigandage in different parts of the kingdom.
                            When the presence of bands is reported, the government dispatches troops
                            in pursuit, with more or less success. Reports come in from time to time
                            of a certain number of outlaws captured or killed at the expense of the
                            lives of more or less of the soldiers. The prisoners are lodged in jail,
                            and in the course of time judgment is pronounced; but it not
                            infrequently happens that “extenuating circumstances” are found to
                            mitigate the punishment of death. Executions occur at rare intervals,
                            and then but few in number. There is a sentiment of pity to which
                            justice at the last moment seems to defer, and in the popular mind an
                            undefined halo of heroism surrounds the “mountain chieftain,” which
                            makes it an ignoble act to take his life away in this summary manner.
                            The glory of the ancient Kleft, the brave defender of his country, the
                            “generous and courageous child of fortune,” casts a pale reflection upon
                            the mere mountain robber of to-day, and serves his turn when nothing
                            else would. It is but just, in the consideration of this subject, to
                            remove the erroneous idea which prevails in many minds, that the brigand
                            is a blood-thirsty monster, reckless of human life, a wild wretch
                            swooping like a bird of prey upon the defenseless traveler, to rob or to
                            kill as many best suit the interests of the moment. A large proportion
                            of the Greek outlaws were forced, or thought themselves forced by
                            circumstances, to take to the mountains to escape worse trials at home.
                            A family quarrel, a homicide, the result of a drinking-house brawl,
                            escape from arrest for some petty offense, desertion from the army, and
                            similar causes have induced men, otherwise peaceable and well-disposed,
                            to become brigands. The lust for gold, the temptation to obtain even a
                            moderate fortune without the labor of toiling for it, and the mere love
                            of adventure, have induced others, who enjoyed good reputations in their
                            village homes, to join their fortunes with those of some wandering band
                            of outlaws. The disposition to shed blood is foreign to their purpose;
                            but their <hi rend="italic">prestige</hi> is only preserved by taking
                            the life of the captive if the ransom or an equivalent to it is not
                            forthcoming. They bind themselves so to do by an acknowledged law, and
                            so well is this understood that the ransom is always paid <pb n="442"
                                xml:id="pg_442" facs="0476"/>by the friends of the captive, the
                            amount being decided by negotiation, which, in some cases, requires many
                            months. The exception to this course is most rare, and never in Greece
                            was there such an exception so unforseen and so bloody in its
                            consequences as that winch has so lately transpired. In this case, the
                            brigands believed that they were “betrayed,” and under a sense of
                            disappointment and anger resolved that their prisoners should not be
                            forced from them. The latter were warned that their lives depended upon
                            them physical ability to keep pace with them in their flight, and had it
                            been possible for them to have done so they would have been alive
                            to-day. This is the first instance in which the life of a foreigner has
                            been taken by Greek brigands. As has been said, it is not for their
                            interest, and it is contrary to their nature to shed blood uselessly. It
                            is equally for their interest to treat their captives well, to look to
                            the condition of their health, and to create a favorable impression by
                            contributing, so far as their mountain habits permit, to the comfort of
                            the unfortunate individuals who fail into their hands. All travelers who
                            have had personal adventures of this kind to relate speak of the rough
                            kindness, if not deference, which they experienced during their
                            captivity. In this and in other respects the Greek brigand is not to be
                            placed in the same category with the desperadoes of southern Italy,
                            Sicily, Spain, and Hungary. Bad as is the actual evil, there is more to
                            fear in the way of personal danger from a solitary tour in Ireland, a
                            journey across the plains of Arizona, or even a nocturnal promenade in
                            the outskirts of London, than there is inany portion of the kingdom of
                            Greece.</p>
                        <p>It is much easier to describe an evil than to suggest practicable
                            remedies for its removal. That Greece will in the course of time rid
                            herself or be rid of the infliction of brigandage is highly probable. To
                            do it speedily and efficiently, requires an organization of power, the
                            beginning of which can hardly be said to have commenced. The murder by
                            brigands of the four foreigners at ——, including two secretaries of
                            legation, produced a shock which was felt wherever the name of Greece is
                            known, and the people of this kingdom are humiliated and saddened to a
                            degree which has raised public attention to the absolute necessity of
                            making the question of brigandage a vital necessity. This sacrifice of
                            precious lives was immediately met by the slaughter of eight of the
                            outlaws, and the capture of four others of the band, and it is not
                            unreasonable to expect that for some time to come a vigorous pursuit of
                            other bands known to exist in Attica will be kept up. But even the
                            greatest success in this way will not rid Greece of brigandage while the
                            adjacent provinces, dependencies of Turkey, are known to swarm with
                            these lawless rascals, whose character for ferocity is. not to be
                            compared with those of Greek nationality, and who enjoy a freedom of
                            action denied to the brigand in Greece.</p>
                        <p>There is an occasional movement of Albanian troops directed against
                            brigandage, but it bears no proportion to even the feeble efforts of the
                            Greek government to suppress the evil. Mr. Rangabéz, now the minister
                            for Greece at Constantinople, was the minister for foreign affairs at
                            Athens in 1856, and was at that time influential in suppresses
                            brigandage on the Turkish side of the border, by obtaining the
                            substitution in Thessaly of regular troops in the place of those of the
                                <hi rend="italic">deuenagos</hi>, “who used to dispense with the use
                            of soldiers to the end that they themselves might pocket the soldiers’
                            fee.” After that arrangement Greece was comparatively free from
                            brigandage until the revolution of 1861, when the old state of things
                            appears to have returned, for Mr. Rangabéz has informed us that so far
                            from fighting them, “the Turks permit the brigands to enter Greece
                            without disturbance, and on their return afford them protection, or what
                            is the same thing, permit them to enter the ranks. The Greek government
                            has for many years exhausted itself with vain representations to the
                            Porte as well as to the protectionary powers against this condition of
                            things.” A correspondent of the Levant Herald, an English journal
                            published in Constantinople, wrote on the 19th of April last, that “at
                            that moment, in Thessaly, brigands held no less than twenty captured
                            persons as hostages for ransom.” This far worse condition of the evil in
                            the Turkish provinces explains one of the grand difficulties which the
                            Greeks have to contend with, but it does not excuse successive
                            governments in Greece for the apathy which exists on this subject when
                            it is not forcibly brought to their notice by outrages committed almost
                            before their very eyes. It is one of those questions which being not
                            easy of management, they hope will, in time, correct itself. It is
                            brought to the surface by party warfare, and is laid aside when its
                            further agitation is unprofitable.</p>
                        <p>It is manifest, that to utterly exterminate brigandage in Greece, the
                            work must begin in Turkey. Greece is the youngest of all the free
                            nations, and has not yet thoroughly learned the elementary branches of
                            political economy. Perhaps if she had fewer teachers she would advance
                            more rapidly. Like all poor and struggling nations, she attracts
                            attention by those defects in her political and social character which
                            other nations conceal beneath an external prosperity. Thus, brigandage
                            is prominent in Greece, while the same evil, in a far more offensive
                            form, has for ages existed in Calabria and the Appenines. It is but
                            lately that Count Gideon Buday, in an official report to the government
                            of Vienna, states that the disclosures of brigands arrested in Cevatia,
                            in Hungary, “compromise more than one thousand persons, but all the
                            suspected <pb n="443" xml:id="pg_443" facs="0477"/>could not be
                            arrested, as sufficient room was not to be found in the prisons, and
                            fears are entertained that further investigation will gravely compromise
                            an incredible number of influential persons, and lead to the discovery
                            of facts of a nature to irritate public opinion.”</p>
                        <p>With a strong and independent government; with a national guard to
                            relieve the regular soldiers; with a thicker population, and with the
                            facility of roads into the interior, brigandage, so far as it is
                            confined to Greece proper, could be utterly exterminated. At present,
                            there are long deserted places, which, to protect properly, would
                            require more soldiers than there are in the kingdom. But even with these
                            disadvantages, if there existed that potent voice of public opinion
                            which is felt only where power is <hi rend="italic">diffused</hi> among
                            a people, no villanous hands of outlaws would dare to practice their
                            enormities in Greece any more than did the ruffians in California, after
                            the people, in self-defense, took the law into their own hands.</p>
                        <p>The Greeks are eminently a peaceful and law-abiding people, and with the
                            gradual introduction of administrative reforms, and less external
                            pressure, will rid themselves of the burdens which now impede their
                            progress.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your dispatch, dated April 19, in reply to my No. 15, and in
                            which you are pleased to say that “In the absence of the correspondence
                            with the British minister, to which you (I) refer, the Department
                            withholds an expression of opinion.”</p>
                        <p>Perhaps in my brief dispatch I failed to convey a correct understanding
                            of my intended meaning. I was not a party to that correspondence and had
                            I been, I should have promptly transmitted the correspondence to you.
                            The changed feeling ascribed to the government in my dispatch was
                            produced by the general unfriendly conduct of the British minister, and
                            that correspondence convinced the government the minister was playing a
                            studied part. It was known to the government that the British minister
                            had called at this legation on behalf of Señor Granados, and that I had
                            refused his request to grant that rebel asylum. It was known too that
                            Mr. Corbett approved my reasons for that refusal, and had agreed with me
                            upon a common line of action, that was to govern the conduct of each
                            toward the insurgents against whom the government had issued orders for
                            their arrest, should they apply for asylum, and that I had held to the
                            understanding, and that he had not.</p>
                        <p>It was known that after the British minister had failed to secure asylum
                            for Granados at this legation, he secreted him in his own house. * * * *
                            It was also known to the government that the French and Italian
                            ministers had absented themselves from this city at this particular
                            time. * * * * These and many similars acts were made known to the
                            President and ministry through their secret agents, and convinced them
                            that Mr. Corbett was false to his professions of friendship for them,
                            and that he was seeking to compromise me with the government from
                            selfish motives.</p>
                        <p>That Mr. Corbett has reaped the severest displeasure of this government
                                <pb n="444" xml:id="pg_444" facs="0478"/>by his conduct toward it is
                            well known here, and that by bringing my conduct to the knowledge of the
                            President and ministry, he has caused them to make known in the most
                            public and marked manner their approval of it, is also true. Mr. Corbett
                            desired and believed that the insurgents would, under the lead of Mandez
                            Cruz, the successor of Serapio, succeed in displacing the present state
                            officials, and his conduct was shaped to secure favor in the event of
                            such success.</p>
                        <p>I believed it to be my duty to sustain the constitutional government in
                            all its just efforts to preserve its authority, and have done so. But I
                            advised firmly against harsh and extreme treatment of these political
                            offenders, and for the mild punishment meted out to them much is due to
                            my advisement and the favorable opinion the government entertained of my
                            conduct during the struggle for supremacy.</p>
                        <p>I have made a careful translation of the correspondence exchanged between
                            the parties, and herewith transmit you copies thereof and copies of the
                            official paper in which it was published.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, with great respect, your obedient servant,</p>

                            <p>S<hi rend="smallcaps">ir</hi>: I had the honor to receive, at
                                half-past nine o’clock last night, the communication which your
                                excellency directed to me, dated the 15th instant, and which is in
                                reply to mine of the 14th instant. Your excellency states that you
                                do not consider yourself obliged to answer the demand which I. by
                                order of the President, directed to you, asking “if it was really
                                true that Don Miguel Garcia Granados was actually in the house of
                                her Britannic Majesty’s legation, against whom an order, for his
                                arrest had been delivered, for complicity with the seditious party
                                that have disturbed the public order.”</p>
                            <p>I consider it to be my duty not to admit in all its latitude the
                                principle claimed by your excellency, that international usages
                                authorize your unlimited right to deny to the local authorities all
                                information that they might be directed to ask of matters
                                transpiring in your house.</p>
                            <p>The admission of such a principle would be equivalent, under many
                                circumstances that could present themselves, to annulling completely
                                the action of justice, and to establish the most complete immunity
                                for abuses committed within the habitation of a foreign agent. The
                                government of Guatemala admits and respects the doctrine of
                                immunity, as the same has been taught by the practice of enlightened
                                nations, and will always consider it a strict duty to respect such
                                right.</p>
                            <p>With regard to the disagreeable incident which has provoked this
                                correspondence, I have received orders from the President to inform
                                your excellency that the President has truthful information that Don
                                Miguel Garcia Granados is really in the house of her Britannic
                                Majesty’s legation, and that it is with sentiments of sincere regret
                                that the President finds himself obliged to make this affirmation,
                                leaving the consequences of a proceeding so strange to the agreeable
                                relations existing between this government and the representative of
                                her Britannic Majesty with him. who, without cause, has sought to
                                alter them.</p>

                                of Don Miguel Garcia Granados, and that the paragraph which heads

                                receipt of your excellency’s dispatch, dated yesterday, in which you
                                refer to the paragraph that precedes the correspondence, published
                                in the last Gaceta, between her Britannic Majesty’s legation and
                                this ministry and which you suspect may convey an impression that
                                your projected voyage might have some connection with the
                                referred-to correspondence.</p>
                            <p>Your excellency desires to inform me that, since November last, you
                                had solicited leave of absence and had received the desired
                                permission las! month and that as there is no connection between
                                that correspondence and your departure, you wish your communication
                                to be published to prevent a wrong impression obtaining with the
                                public on that subject.</p>
                            <p>In reply I have the honor to manifest to your excellency, that,
                                really, there does not exist any connection whatever between your
                                next voyage and the incident which gave birth to the correspondence
                                published in the Gaceta. For, I am aware that your excellency had
                                solicited leave of absence long before that incident took place, and
                                therefore we have no objection whatever to the publication of your
                                dispatch, and it will be inserted in the next number of the Gaceta,
                                together with my reply to it.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt, by the steamer of the 18th instant, of your dispatch No. 17,
                            dated July 7, ultimo.</p>
                        <p>I have just been informed by an American gentleman, who came direct from
                            that town, that Don Miguel Garcia Granados and Mendez Cruz are at
                            Comitan, just across the border, and that they have recruited about 500
                            men, are daily expecting arms from Vera Cruz, and that when received
                            they propose to invade the territory of and revolutionize this
                            government.</p>
                        <p>The government have received the same information through departmental
                            officers, and there now remains not a doubt as to the presence there and
                            the purposes of these arch-rebels.</p>
                        <p>Granados is the party to whom the British minister granted asylum, and
                            afterward surrendered his person upon demand made by this government.
                            The ministry here believed that Granados has purchased the coöperation
                            of the principal departmental officials of Chiapas and Socomesco, and
                            the late reported invasion of Mexican territory by Guatemalians was
                            started by these Mexican officials in the interest of Granados, and the
                            government have sent a strong force to the border to engage the
                            insurgents should they cross the boundary line. The Mexican State of
                            Chiapas has allowed Guatemalian insurgents to recruit their forces on
                            its frontier again and again since my residence here, and, in many ways,
                            has given evidence of a most implacable enmity toward this government,
                            as personally constituted.</p>
                        <p>With a purpose to end these unfriendly acts, and to come to a good
                            understanding with Mexico, the minister of state of this republic has
                            addressed two notes to that of Mexico bringing these matters to his
                            attention. He called at this legation and made a personal request that I
                            inclose them to our minister at Mexico for safe delivery, and that we
                            jointly urge their favorable consideration.</p>
                        <pb n="447" xml:id="pg_447" facs="0481"/>
                        <p>Regarding it to be for our own better interests that peace should be
                            preserved between these two republics, I have addressed a note to Mr.
                            Nelson, as requested by him, and herewith inclose a copy marked A. I
                            also inclose a copy of a memorandum, furnished by the state department,
                            for the private information of Mr. Nelson, and which is marked B.</p>
                        <p>The allegations contained in the memorandum are undoubtedly true, known
                            to me to be so, and just as related by parties to me, who came seeking
                            the influence of this legation for Granados, and by that consummate
                            villian and arch-traitor himself.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, with great respect, your obedient servant,</p>

                                minister of foreign affairs of this republic to the minister of
                                foreign affairs of Mexico on the subject of border difficulties, and
                                which I have been requested to transmit to you for delivery.</p>
                            <p>I also inclose a statement of the particular acts complained of by
                                this government, made out and furnished by the state department, and
                                from which it will be seen the Mexican officials of the departments
                                of Chiapas and Socomesco are mainly responsible for the unfriendly
                                conduct and hostile acts recited.</p>
                            <p>I regret to state that my information sustains each allegation as is
                                charged by this government.</p>
                            <p>The object sought by the Guatemalian government in thus addressing
                                the Mexican government is, to ascertain if their differences cannot
                                be settled by peaceful negotiations, and our friendly offices in
                                that behalf are solicited by this government.</p>
                            <p>I believe it to be her true policy, and I am fully convinced this
                                government earnestly desires amity with Mexico.</p>
                            <p>Señor Don Pedro de Aycinena, the secretary for foreign affairs of
                                this republic, assures me his government is entirely willing to
                                submit to friendly arbitration all questions of disagreement, or to
                                settle them by friendly discussion, as Mexico may prefer.</p>
                            <p>If, then, the Mexican government be equally inclined to peace and
                                friendly disposed, a speedy adjustment can be reached, and, as it is
                                equally important to our Government as to these that their
                                controversy finds a peaceful solution, we should aid in that
                                behalf.</p>
                            <p>Therefore I beg you to call upon the President of Mexico and his
                                secretary of state, and to urge them to an acceptance of the
                                proposals of this government.</p>
                            <p>That is certainly the first duty of the Mexican government, and the
                                most politic and certain way to secure undisturbed possession of her
                                own border territory, and the friendship of Guatemala when needed;
                                and, in the constantly changing condition of her own domestic
                                relations, it is not difficult to forsee that the occurrences of a
                                single day may make the friendship of Guatemala of the first
                                importance to Mexico.</p>
                            <p>But your larger, experience in dealing with these questions will
                                suggest the correct line of conduct, and the arguments most fitting
                                to be urged to gain a favorable hearing and result; therefore I
                                intrust to your better judgment the management of our joint
                                commission.</p>
                            <p>I have the honor to be, with great respect, your obedient
                                servant.</p>

                            <p>The authorities of the State of Chiapas, near neighbor of Guatemala,
                                have shown during the last few years, and especially since 1867,
                                very little benevolence toward this republic. Giving asylum in its
                                territory, indiscriminately, not only to fugitives for political
                                causes, but also to criminals who have fled on account of common
                                crimes; thus, it has been formed in the frontier towns of Chiapas
                                and Socomesco a center of hostilities against Guatemala, from which
                                expeditionary parties of armed men have come to molest and disturb
                                the peace of our tranquil populations.</p>
                            <p>The revolution headed by General Cruz, which did so much mischief to
                                the country, <pb n="448" xml:id="pg_448" facs="0482"/>came from
                                Chiapas; and if that disorder lasted so long, it was due to the fact
                                that as many times as the rebels were beaten by the regular forces
                                of the government they went to seek refuge in the neighboring
                                territory, where they recruited themselves and prepared to repeat
                                their aggressions. That rebellion had not in reality any political
                                character, and its principal means of action was to encourage the
                                hatred of the Indian race against the other races inhabiting the

                            <p>This very day, a new invasion of Guatemala is being organized
                                publicly in Chiapas, promoted by Don Miguel Garcia Granados, a
                                Guatemalan citizen who left the country in March last, under the
                                compromise backed by a bail, of not trying to disturb public order,
                                and not to return without special permission of the government. This
                                individual is now busy enlisting soldiers in Comitan, a frontier
                                town, in making other preparations, and it is said that he is
                                expecting some arms from the United States, by way of Vera Cruz and
                                Tabasco. These facts have been officially denounced to the governor
                                of Chiapas, but he has given no answer to these remonstrances.</p>
                            <p>For a longtime there has existed in Guatemala a number of emigrants
                                or exiles from Chiapas, larger perhaps than the number of
                                Guatemalians who are there; and not only they are not allowed to
                                commit hostilities against the authorities of that State to which
                                they seem always disposed, but they are obliged to reside peacefully
                                in the interior of the country.</p>
                            <p>This government does not pretend to expect that the authorities of
                                Chiapas should deny the asylum to the emigrants, nor asks for the
                                delivery of the criminals, although it could do so in virtue of an
                                ancient treaty of extradition; it has only demanded of them to do
                                with the Guatemala emigrants who have taken asylum in Chiapas as it
                                is done here with the Chiapans residing in Guatemala—that is, not to
                                permit them to live in the frontier places nor hostilize this
                                republic.</p>
                            <p>There is no motive whatever of discord between Guatemala and Mexico,
                                nor contrary interests between the two people; it being entirely
                                false the report of aggressive intentions on the part of this
                                republic, with the object of occupying the territory of Socomesco.
                                The prefect of that department is the person who has authorized the
                                occupation of a part of Guatemala, arbitrarily altering the
                                recognized limits from time immemorial, and intimating to the
                                inhabitants of those places that they must recognize the Mexican
                                authorities or abandon the localities where they have always lived.
                                To give to this so irregular and arbitrary proceeding a semblance of
                                legitimacy, the prefect has supposed an invasion of Guatemalians,
                                and has given upon this incident a false report to the federal
                                government of Mexico. The minister of foreign affairs of Guatemala
                                has addressed two notes to that of Mexico, stating the truth of
                                these facts, giving the most ample assurances that on the part of
                                Guatemala there has not taken place any act of hostility, and
                                demanding that orders be given to the authorities of Chiapas to
                                fulfil the duties imposed on them by the international law in the
                                relations between two neighboring states who are at peace.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> The intelligence of the overthrow of the
                            Napoleonic dynasty, and of the proclamation of the republic in France,
                            has thus far produced no general excitement in Italy. These events have
                            been expected for weeks, and of course do not come in the form of a
                            surprise. They will, however, exert a powerful influence on Italian
                            politics, and their effects are not the less likely to be great and
                            lasting, because they do not immediately manifest themselves in popular
                            agitation.</p>
                        <p>The news put an immediate end to the hesitation of the cabinet on the
                            Roman question, and it was decided yesterday evening, in a ministerial
                                <pb n="449" xml:id="pg_449" facs="0483"/>council, to proceed
                            immediately to the occupation of the Pontifical territory. Negotiations
                            with foreign powers, and informally with the Papacy on this subject are
                            understood to have been in progress for some days, and though the Pope
                            has not yet given his consent to the entrance of the Italian troops, it
                            does not seem probable that an armed resistance to so overwhelming a
                            superiority of force will be attempted.</p>
                        <p>All minds are now occupied with the solution of the difficult question of
                            the future relations between the kingdom and the Papacy; and the fate
                            not only of the present administration, but of interests far more
                            important than the continuance or the retirement of a cabinet will
                            depend much on the terms which the government shall offer to the
                            Church.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> The announcement in my dispatch, No. 300,
                            that the Italian government had decided upon the occupation of the
                            Pontifical territory was made upon the authority of the Opinione, a
                            journal which, though not technically an official gazette, is generally
                            better informed respecting the policy of the ministry than any other
                            political paper published at Florence, but it proves erroneous.</p>
                        <p>The government is, however, sending a very large force to the frontier,
                            and there is much reason to believe that the ministry intends to take
                            immediate and decisive action, and thereby anticipate, if not prevent,
                            popular movements which will otherwise inevitably very soon break out in
                            both the Italian and the Papal territory, and that, too, in a form
                            possibly more difficult to deal with than the Roman question itself.</p>
                        <p>It is announced this morning that Count Ponza di San Martino, a
                            conspicuous member of the Piedmontese opposition party, is on his way to
                            Rome on a special mission from the Italian government to the Pope. This
                            gentlemen’s known opinions are in favor of the immediate political, as
                            well as military, occupation of Rome, and of the removal of the national
                            capital from Florence to that city. It has not transpired what the exact
                            nature of his instructions is, but it is not in the least likely that he
                            would have accepted the appointment unless they are in accordance with
                            his political views.</p>
                        <p>So far as I can learn, no political party in Italy has any clear and
                            settled views as to the future relations between the kingdom and the
                            Papacy, and there is nothing in any of the declarations of the present
                            ministry which indicates that it sees its way a whit more clearly than
                            the people.</p>
                        <p>By the first article of the constitution of 1848, the state is pledged to
                            the exclusive maintenance of the Catholic religion; by repeated
                            ministerial and royal declarations, it is pledged to the absolute
                            separation of church and state, and the recognition of absolute equality
                            of rights in different religious sects; and by the disastrous convention
                            of 1864, it has admitted the right of foreign intervention between Italy
                            and the Papacy, and has pledged itself to defend the Pontifical
                            territory against any assertion of right by the Italian people.</p>
                        <pb n="450" xml:id="pg_450" facs="0484"/>
                        <p>In short Italy has unwisely placed herself in a position which cannot be
                            long endured, but from which she cannot be extricated without either
                            concessions from Rome and the Catholic powers, which she has no reason
                            to expect, or a violation of pledges, some of which were very
                            indiscreetly given.</p>
                        <p>One policy suggested, but I hope not approved by the ministry, is to take
                            immediate military possession of the states of the Church, leaving the
                            civil government in the hands of the Papal authorities until the final
                            relations between the kingdom and Rome are settled by the European
                            congress, of which so many continental statesmen are now dreaming.</p>
                        <p>This is equivalent to a surrender of the whole claim of Italy to the
                            territory in question The Italian kingdom has no friends among the
                            governments of Europe, nor could it count on a single voice in a general
                            congress upon any of the issues between itself and Rome.</p>

                            evening.</p>
                        <p>I inclose herewith printed slips containing the instructions given to
                            Count Ponza di San Martino, special envoy to Rome, and two circulars of
                            the minister of foreign affairs to the diplomatic representatives of
                            Italy at foreign courts, in reference to the intended occupation.</p>
                        <p>Count Ponza di San Martino’s report of his reception at Rome is not yet
                            made public, but I shall probably be able to send a copy of it in a day
                            or two. It is not known at this hour whether forcible resistance will be
                            made by the papal government, but it is not expected.</p>
                        <p>The Italian government has long hesitated in the adoption of a decided
                            policy, and in fact it has been so constantly in the habit of blindly
                            following the dictation of the Emperor of France in the conduct of all
                            its foreign relations, without attempting to mark out a policy for
                            itself, that since the downfall of the empire silenced its oracle the
                            ministry has been completely bewildered and quite unable to arrive at a
                            conclusion upon any subject until forced by the fear of popular violence
                            to decide upon the military occupation of the Papal territory.</p>
                        <p>Its future course in this matter, unless controlled by external forces,
                            will be characterized by vacillation, tergiversation and duplicity, as
                            it has always been since 1864, and I see no reason to hope that any
                            measures originated by this or any probable future cabinet will tend to
                            settle the question upon any terms which ought to be acceptable to the
                            Italian people.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> The Italian troops entered Rome yesterday,
                            after a short resistance, and are now in full possession of the entire
                            Roman territory. It is worth noticing that on the approach of the
                            Italian forces the Baron von Arnim, Prussian minister at Rome, came out
                            to the headquarters of the commanding general, at the instance of the
                            Papal government, and informed him that the Pope did not wish resistance
                            to be made, but that “the militia were masters of the situation and
                            would not lay down their arms as long as they could hold the city.”</p>
                        <p>The Italian government believed that this was merely an evasion of the
                            Papal government to throw the responsibility of shedding blood upon
                            other shoulders than its own, and the fact now known that the garrison
                            ceased firing and surrendered, when ordered by the Pope, shows that the
                            soldiers were throughout under the authority of the Vatican.</p>
                        <p>The Italian government, which in this matter appears to have acted from
                            the beginning in obedience to popular dictation and the pressure from
                            Piedmont, proposes a plebiscite on the question of annexation, but
                            whether it will submit, at the same time, that of the transfer of the
                            capital, I am unable to say. In any case, the Parliament will be
                            convoked as soon as possible, and the policy of the ministry will then
                            be accommodated to what is believed to be the will of the nation, the
                            cabinet having no longer a policy of its own on any subject.</p>
                        <p>Indeed, the purposes, or at least professions, of the ministry have
                            changed very suddenly, although it pledged itself to carry out the
                            “national programme” at the session of the senate three weeks ago; the
                            president of the council solemnly assured the senate that the government
                            would in no case resort to force, and the minister of foreign affairs,
                            only last week, declared, in the most explicit manner, to eminent
                            statesmen opposed to the movement, that the Italian troops could never
                            enter Rome, and that they would simply occupy strategic points, none of
                            which would probably be within twenty miles of the city.</p>
                        <p>The terms proposed by the government to the Papacy have not been
                            authoritatively promulgated, but one of them is believed to be the offer
                            of the independent sovereignty of the Città Leonina, or right bank of
                            the Tiber, and of all the ecclesiastical establishments in the city on
                            the left bank. I do not think it improbable that such a proposal has
                            been made, but I cannot believe that the ministry really supposes such a
                                <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> could possibly be carried out.
                            Thus far the Pope refuses to treat at all, and his obstinacy may
                            seriously embarrass both the King and the Parliament, but so far as I
                            can now judge it seems altogether probable that the removal of the seat
                            of government to Rome at an early day will be voted by a large majority.
                            This will be a hard measure for Florence, which has incurred a debt of
                            forty millions of francs in city improvements not yet half finished, to
                            fit it for a national capital, and it will involve in ruin hundreds, if
                            not thousands, of capitalists who have invested largely in city funds,
                            and still more largely in building houses for the accommodation of a
                            rapidly augmenting population, which will now as rapidly diminish.</p>
                        <pb n="452" xml:id="pg_452" facs="0486"/>
                        <p>The restoration of the French empire is still hoped for by the French
                            party in Italy, and I was told yesterday, on excellent authority, that
                            the Italian minister believed that in that event Austria will coöperate
                            with Italy in compelling the people of France to accept the fallen
                            dynasty.</p>
                        <p>The force sent to the Roman territory, instead of forty thousand men, is
                            now stated to have amounted to not less than seventy or eighty thousand.
                            The probable object of this accumulation of troops in that region is to
                            disarm suspicion as to the real motives of the government in calling out
                            so large levies, by avoiding, for the moment, the concentration of a
                            considerable army near the French frontier.</p>
                        <p>The action of the ministry toward Rome has, for the time, completely
                            disarmed the opposition, and the tranquillity of the kingdom—leaving out
                            of view the probable effect of the successful establishment of a
                            republic in France—will depend much on the form which shall be given to
                            the relations between the Italian Crown and the Papacy.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> The Italian government has at length
                            decided to dissolve the present and elect a new Chamber of Deputies, and
                            I inclose herewith a journal containing the royal proclamation for the
                            dissolution and new elections, as well as for the convocation of
                            Parliament on the 5th of December next.</p>
                        <p>The same journal contains the report of the council to the King on the
                            Papal question, and you will perceive that the guarantees now offered to
                            the Papacy are more limited than those which had been proposed on some
                            former occasions.</p>
                        <p>Public opinion has pronounced itself on this point, as well as on the
                            removal of the capital to Rome, in a way which can be neither
                            misinterpreted nor resisted, and in reference to this latter measure,
                            conspicuous political men have gone so far as to declare, in numerously
                            attended public meetings, that the refusal or long delay of the
                            government to fulfill the national aspirations would very seriously
                            endanger the monarchy.</p>
                        <p>These declarations, which the ministers very well know were not empty
                            chimeras, have been warmly applauded, and they, and other energetic
                            expressions of the popular will, have, no doubt, had their influence in
                            bringing the ministry to a decision.</p>
                        <p>The assertion of the ministry in the report that “The removal of the seat
                            of government to Florence, and the convention of the 15th of September,
                                <hi rend="italic">devised with a view of facilitating the solution
                                of this arduous question, by affirming anew the right of the Romans

                            aspirations for Rome,” is, to say the least, noteworthy, and will not,
                            taken in all its parts, be received with universal assent by persons
                            well informed in regard to the history of the convention, and its
                            influence on the public sentiment of Italy.</p>

                            (inclosure No. 1) translation of an “account of persecutions of native
                            Christians” in the Soto Islands, which was kindly furnished me by the
                            French minister, who received it from the hands of the French Roman

                        <p>While I do not doubt that the humbler classes of Japanese are frequently
                            subject to ill-treatment, and occasionally to torture, by their
                            two-sworded officials, at places at some distance from any seat of
                            government, I still incline to the opinion expressed in my dispatch No.
                            30, of the 27th ultimo, and also believe that such persecutions, as far
                            as alleged to be owing to conversions to Christianity, are often
                            exaggerated, it not entirely unfounded.</p>
                        <p>The Soto Islands, as far as I have been able to ascertain, have never
                            been visited yet by any foreign missionary, and it is difficult to see
                            how the inhabitants, few of whom ever leave their homes, could ever have
                            become converted to the Roman Catholic faith.</p>
                        <p>I transmit inclosure No. 2. copy of an identical letter addressed by the
                            foreign representative on the subject to the Japanese ministers for
                            foreign affairs, and as soon as their reply shall have been received, a
                            translation will be at once submitted to you.</p>

                                    the islands of Soto.</hi></head>
                            <p>At the date of the 16th April the places where Christians were
                                subjected to the worst treatment were: 1, Matsugahama; 2,
                                Uragashira; 3, Mitsunoura; and, 4, Kusubari.</p>
                            <p>I. Matsugahama is a village in the island of Fusakajima. It was in
                                this little island that the persecution commenced on the 12th
                                November, 1868.</p>
                            <p>In the first instance 22 Christians were seized, imprisoned at Fukai,
                                the capital of Soto, and then put to the torture. A little while
                                later these prisoners, together with all the Christians of the
                                island, men, women, and children, nearly 200 persons in all, were
                                taken to Matsugahama, where they must still be, with the exception
                                of those who are dead. Torture, hunger, and cold have already killed
                                numerous persons.</p>
                            <p>1. Paul Sakeichi, aged 79 years, arrested the 12th November, was
                                beaten with an iron rod, and thrown in prison, where he died toward
                                the middle of December, of hunger, cold, and the blows he had
                                received.</p>
                            <p>2. Francis Rikiso, aged 55, son of the above Sakeichi, arrested the
                                same day as his father, was, after being beaten almost to death,
                                submitted to the torture named <hi rend="italic">sangtshino
                                    seine,</hi> during which he fainted. On recovering
                                consciousness, he was, on the following day, tortured again; the
                                executioners beat him with iron bars, putting live coals into his
                                mouth. Again it was thought he was dead. Thrown into a prison where
                                he had scarcely room to rest his bruised body, he was soon nothing
                                but one living sore, and died, after three months of agony, on the
                                17th February, 1869. His body was left unburied for four days and
                                nights in the midst of the prisoners.</p>
                            <p>3. John Iokichi, child at the breast, died of starvation on the 8th
                                December.</p>
                            <p>4. Jane Shimo, aged less than a year, died of starvation on the 29th
                                January.</p>
                            <p>5. Catherine Soichi, aged less than a year, died of starvation on the
                                22d February.</p>
                            <p>6. Peter Sango, aged 4 years, died of cold and starvation on the 12th
                                March.</p>
                            <p>7. Marie Mam, aged 59 years, arrested in November, and beaten almost
                                to death at the time, died of her wounds on the 18th March.</p>
                            <pb n="454" xml:id="pg_454" facs="0488"/>
                            <p>8. Elizabeth Some, aged 42 years, tortured as in the preceding case,
                                and died of her wounds on the 14th March.</p>
                            <p>9. Paul Rekimaten, aged two years, died of starvation on the 29th
                                March.</p>
                            <p>10. Madeline Noyo, aged 21 years, died of starvation and cold on the
                                1st April</p>
                            <p>11. Teela Yomo, aged 4 years, died of hunger and cold on the 1st
                                April.</p>
                            <p>12. Thomas Macajino, aged 4 years, died of hunger and cold.</p>
                            <p>13. Maria Sercio, aged 4 years, died of hunger and cold.</p>
                            <p>14. Julia Toichi, aged 4 years, died of hunger and cold.</p>
                            <p>15. Dominica Fumi, aged 11 years, died of hunger and cold.</p>
                            <p>16. Domenci Hansuke, aged 6 years, died of hunger and cold.</p>
                            <p>17. Another child, name unknown, died of hunger and cold.</p>
                            <p>II. At Uragashira 59 men were locked up on the 16th December, 1868.
                                Since then their women and children have been added to this number.
                                This addition took place in the middle of March.</p>
                            <p>III. The Christians of Mitsunoura, and those of Furejima, are shut up
                                in the same prison. Their number was at first 60; it is now doubled
                                by the imprisonment of their women and children.</p>
                            <p>IV. At Kusubari, on the 3d January, there were only 31 prisoners: now
                                the women and children share the fate of their brothers and fathers,
                                as in the prisons above mentioned.</p>
                            <p>The Christians of these four prisons are almost piled up one upon the
                                other to such a degree that seventeen persons have only a mat 6 feet
                                long and 3 broad. They have suffered terribly from hunger. All have
                                not been tortured. Those who have been so have undergone the torture
                                known to the Japanese as <hi rend="italic">ichome mitshame sanqshimo
                                    seine.</hi> Certain women have been exposed naked to the gaze of
                                the executioners and or the crowd.</p>
                            <p>The tortures named above have not been applied with full rigor,
                                doubtless for fear of causing violent death. Of the tortured
                                prisoners who have succeeded in escaping from prison, two have been
                                received in one family, and in spite of assiduous care have not yet
                                been healed of the wounds inflicted by the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >sangtshino seine.</hi> (They were tortured toward the end of
                                January.) One had his left leg, and the other his right arm, in an
                                almost hopeless state.</p>
                            <p>At Kakuehigarasima and Dainoura the Christians are actually kept
                                under surveillance in their villages until the return from
                                Simonosiki of a daikoran, who has gone thither to receive orders
                                respecting them.</p>

                                <p>I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your excellencies’
                                    letter of May 1, stating that Yamaguchi Hanzo, the officer who
                                    had been sent to inquire into the alleged persecutions of native
                                    Christians in the islands of Soto, had returned and reported
                                    that no such persecutions had occurred. And in a further
                                    dispatch, dated the 15th instant, your excellencies also state
                                    that the same unreserved denial had been made by Clan Soto, who
                                    had been examined by your excellencies at Yeddo.</p>
                                <p>I think it therefore my duty to place in the hands of your
                                    excellencies the accompanying detailed statement of information
                                    received by me on this painful subject. From the particulars
                                    therein given, it would appear that as many as four hundred
                                    Christians of both sexes, and all ages, have been arrested; that
                                    many of them have been tortured; and that two men, three women,
                                    and twelve children have died under the treatment they received,
                                    or from the effects of cold and hunger.</p>
                                <p>Your excellencies cannot fail to be struck with the wide variance
                                    which is observable between the reports they have received and
                                    the statement furnished the foreign representatives, and you
                                    will doubtless see the necessity of carefully prosecuting your
                                    inquiries until the truth shall have been ascertained. I would
                                    desire that this investigation should be effected solely by the
                                    Mikado government without interference on the part of the
                                    foreign representatives. And I, together with my colleagues,
                                    will therefore anxiously await the receipt of the further
                                    communication which your excellencies are so good as to promise

                        <p>On the 10th instant I received another letter from the Japanese minister,
                            announcing that the native Christians remaining at Urakami, near
                            Nagasaki, would be placed under sentence of labor, in charge of several
                            daimios, and deported accordingly. (Translation herewith, inclosure No.
                            2.) On the same day, I received from our consul at Nagasaki (inclosure
                            No. 3.) copy of a joint protest of the consuls of the treaty powers at
                            that port against the contemplated banishment or deportation of seven
                            hundred of those native Christians to parts unknown.</p>
                        <p>I at once addressed a letter on this important subject to the Japanese
                            minister for foreign affairs, copy of which I herewith transmit,
                            (inclosure No. 4,) urging a reconsideration of the measure, and calling
                            their attention to the disastrous influence which persecution of
                            Christians would not fail to exercise on their relations with the United
                            States and other treaty powers.</p>
                        <p>I also transmit (inclosures Nos. 5 and 6) copies of the letters addressed
                            to the Japanese minister for foreign affairs on this subject by the
                            ministers of France and Great Britain respectively; the latter dated
                            from Hiogo.</p>
                        <p>The British minister having since returned to this port, a conference was
                            at once held, at which it was unanimously determined to address a joint
                            note to the government of the Tenno, asking for an interview with all
                            the heads of departments on the subject at Yeddo. I transmit (in closure
                            No. 7) copy of that joint note.</p>
                        <p>I have this day received (translation herewith, inclosure No. 8) a letter
                            from the Japanese minister in reply to mine of the 11th instant, stating
                            their reasons for the instructions issued by the Tenno for the
                            deportation of those unfortunate Christians, but holding out no promise
                            of amendment of their fate.</p>
                        <p>It is to be hoped that an interview with all the principal members of the
                            government may be had at an early day, and in time for transmission of
                            the result by this mail.</p>

                            <p>In reply to the letter received in the 5th month of last year, we now
                                beg to inform your excellency that we duly inquired into the alleged
                                ill treatment of Christians, from the officers in charge of the Soto
                                Islands; and, as their statement did not appear to us sufficiently
                                explicit, we directed some officers from Nagasaki to visit those
                                islands and investigate the matter on the spot.</p>
                            <p>Altogether, there were more than one thousand persons on those
                                islands who professed Christianity. Out of those, three hundred and
                                thirty-five were reconverted to their own country’s religion, after
                                having been gradually advised and disciplined. Five hundred and
                                ninety-three were kept in prison, where they continued to receive
                                advice, and one hundred and forty of those persons escaped from
                                their prison.</p>
                            <p>It having been reported that some of those had formed a conspiracy to
                                rise against authority, they were caught and tried, and those who
                                did not confess were coerced in <pb n="456" xml:id="pg_456"
                                    facs="0490"/>the usual way, in order to extort confession from
                                them; but they have not been struck with iron rods, nor has fire
                                been put into their mouths, as mentioned in your letter. Moreover,
                                the prison, so-called, was simply a dwelling-house arranged in such
                                a way that the persons kept in it could not go out during the night.
                                During the daytime they were permitted to work on their farms. Of
                                this large number some have died from natural causes, but not from
                                any cruel treatment administered. Those persons received a much
                                gentler treatment than usually accorded to criminals under the laws;
                                and since special orders were issued during the last (sixth) month
                                relative to Christianity, ill treatment of native Christians has
                                been forbidden, and we believe, therefore, that the cruelties
                                reported to have been practiced are simply the result of rumors
                                without foundation. These rumors, however, having again been heard,
                                we have sent other officers to those islands, under instructions to
                                make a still fuller investigation.</p>
                            <p>In the mean time we address you the foregoing for your information in
                                reply.</p>

                            <p>We have the honor to inform you that the native Christians in
                                Urakami, near Nagasaki, were last year distributed among several
                                princes, under sentence of labor. After inquiring, it appeared that
                                several had remained, but, owing to the disturbances at the time, we
                                were unable then to dispose of them.</p>
                            <p>Tranquillity now having been restored, we intend to deliver those who
                                remained to the several princes, to be under their control, and to
                                perform the same labor as their own people; our reasons for this
                                measure being, that if those Christians remain undisturbed, from the
                                unfriendly feelings of which they are the objects, difficulties will
                                inevitably arise between them and their neighbors, and in this
                                manner it will become troublesome to govern those
                                country-people.</p>
                            <p>In conclusion, we beg to state that, all rumors that may be
                                circulated notwithstanding, those people will not be subject to any
                                severe labor.</p>

                                treaty powers, resident at Nagasaki, have the honor to address you
                                on the subject of the native Christians living at Urakami.</p>
                            <p>It has been reported to us that seven hundred of these Christians are
                                on the point of being compelled to embark on board of two steamers
                                and banished to a distant part of Japan, thereby separating them
                                from their homes and families, and from no other motive than because
                                they are Christians. We do not address to you this letter with any
                                wish to interfere with the jurisdiction which you possess over your
                                people, but simply, in the name of humanity, to beg you not to adopt
                                any measures of persecution toward the people at Urakami for the
                                sole reason that they are Christians, for we can assure you that
                                such inhuman measures will be regarded with indignation by the
                                civilized world.</p>

                            <p>In this connection I beg to tender you late intelligence from
                                Nagasaki by inclosing copy of a joint letter dated on Sunday, the 2d
                                instant, addressed by the consuls of the treaty powers to the
                                governor of that port. According to two days’ later intelligence,
                                (namely, the 4th instant,) her Britannic Majesty’s minister then at
                                Nagasaki requested the governor to delay for fifteen days the
                                deportation of <hi rend="italic">not less than the seven</hi>
                                hundred of those unfortunate people, (referred to in in closure,)
                                but in reply was informed by the governor that his orders were
                                peremptory, and that he had no alternative but to send them in
                                steamers to distant parts of Japan.</p>
                            <pb n="457" xml:id="pg_457" facs="0491"/>
                            <p>I cannot find terms sufficiently expressive of my profound regret at
                                this occurrence, and can only believe that you are imperfectly aware
                                of the disastrous influence which this measure, if carried out, will
                                not fail to exercise on the relation between Japan and all the
                                treaty powers.</p>
                            <p>From the introduction of foreign science and of useful improvements
                                for the benefit of the people, modern civilization is now deeply
                                interested in witnessing the effects of Japan under the government
                                of his Majesty the Tenno, to take rank among the foremost powers of
                                the world, and painful will be the impression abroad, and subversive
                                of all feeling of good-will now being created, when it becomes known
                                that Japanese are being punished by deportation or banishment, or in
                                any manner whatever, for professing or pretending to profess
                                religious opinions, in no respect interfering with the duties as
                                citizens or subjects.</p>
                            <p>The absolute freedom in all matters of religious belief has been and

                                prosperity of the United States, and nations may be said to prosper
                                in proportion as their governments abstain from interference in
                                matters of conscience.</p>
                            <p>There can be no friendship without respect: and if the government of
                                Japan now forfeits the latter by inconsiderate steps, its relations
                                with other powers will be considered unsound and untrustworthy. The
                                punishment or coercion of Japanese for religious belief will be
                                deemed to furnish the measure of Japanese civilization, and will be
                                so regarded by all the nations in treaty with Japan.</p>
                            <p>The loss of respect, I need not point out to your excellencies, will
                                necessarily involve a loss of confidence. It will turn the
                                friendship that now exists into suspicion of the ulterior designs of
                                your government, and may, in the opinion of foreign governments,
                                suggest the expediency of being prepared to guard against
                                contingencies in future dealings with Japan.</p>
                            <p>While thus submitting in general terms the effects which any
                                ill-considered action of your government in this important matter
                                will produce, I may be permitted to express the hope that the
                                Japanese government will take it into reconsideration, and thus
                                enable my colleagues and myself to officially contradict the
                                impressions which the knowledge of the contemplated treatment of
                                native Christians, as thus far announced, will not fail to
                                create.</p>

                            <p>On arriving at Nagasaki on the 3d instant, the undersigned learned
                                with deep concern that the local government had issued orders for
                                the immediate removal of nearly the whole of the male population of
                                the village of Urakami, amounting to about seven hundred men, for
                                the sole reason that they continue, as they have done for along time
                                past, to make professions of the Christian faith. These orders had
                                been issued in the most sudden and peremptory manner; the first
                                notice was given on the evening of the 1st instant, when the men in
                                question were summoned to appear in the government office at
                                Nagasaki, on the following day, in order to be put aboard two
                                steamers, then waiting to receive them, and to convey them away from
                                their homes and families to the places selected for their exile.</p>
                            <p>They had committed no offense, but, on the contrary, had
                                industriously followed their agricultural pursuits; and only twenty
                                days before the issue of the above order they had paid in the taxes
                                due on the harvest which they had just husbanded. On hearing that
                                they were to be torn from their homes, many of these poor people
                                fled in dismay to the adjoining hills, while about one hundred and
                                fifty presented themselves at the government office. Thus their
                                families were suddenly deprived of means of support, and a peaceful
                                village was converted into a scene of general distress.</p>
                            <p>Immediately on receiving this painful intelligence, the undersigned
                                sought an interview with the chikongi of Nagasaki, Nomura Gio, who
                                visited him on the afternoon of the 3d instant, accompanied by
                                Watanabe Daichie, of the censorate. The undersigned regretted to
                                find that these officers confirmed the correctness of the above
                                statement.</p>
                            <p>They were acting, they said, upon orders received from Yeddo, and
                                Watanabe had been specially sent from the capital to see to the
                                execution of these orders, which were to the effect that the
                                remainder of the Christians within the jurisdiction of Nagasaki,
                                numbering, according to their estimate, between one and two thousand
                                souls, were all to be sent into exile.</p>
                            <p>The undersigned explained with much earnestness to these officers the
                                assurance <pb n="458" xml:id="pg_458" facs="0492"/>which he and the
                                ministers of the treaty powers had received on the subject a year
                                ago from the government of his Majesty the Tenno, and pointed out
                                that the steps they were now taking were wholly opposed to those
                                assurances. The Tenno’s government had promised the foreign
                                representatives, in a letter written in January last, that their
                                treatment of the native Christians would be marked by the
                                progressive spirit of the age; that they were sensible that it would
                                be an offense to all those Christian nations with whom Japan wished
                                to cultivate friendly relations to prosecute Japanese subjects
                                simply because they professed the religion of those nations, and
                                that the government of the Tenno had determined to maintain no
                                longer the old severe laws against Christianity, but would adopt in
                                place of them a mild and lenient course of action. Although the
                                undersigned was not called on to discuss with local officers a
                                subject which had already been so fully considered with the Japanese
                                government, he did not fail to point out to them that the
                                persecution of native Christians would bring discredit upon their
                                country, and might gravely prejudice the relations of Japan with
                                foreign states, as the latter could scarcely fail to regard such
                                proceedings as unfriendly to themselves.</p>
                            <p>Nomura Goi and Watanabe retired to consider the remonstrances of the
                                undersigned but on visiting him again on the morning of the 4th they
                                informed him that no other course was open to them but to carry out
                                their orders.</p>
                            <p>The undersigned repeated his conviction that their action must be
                                founded upon some misconception of the orders of the supreme
                                government. He, therefore, urged that further proceedings should be
                                delayed, and that Watanabe should accompany the undersigned to
                                Yeddo, to confer with the supreme government, but, unfortunately,
                                Nomura Goi and Watanabe declined to entertain this proposal.</p>
                            <p>It only remains, therefore, for the undersigned to forward this
                                protest against the proceedings of these officers to their
                                excellencies the Japanese ministers for foreign affairs, in order
                                that it may be laid without delay before the government of his
                                Majesty the Tenno. He expects to return to Yokohama in a few days,
                                and he will then join his colleagues, the representatives of the
                                other treaty powers, in such further steps as they and he may think
                                it advisable to adopt. But in the mean time he trusts that the
                                Tenno’s government will at once see the necessity of disavowing and
                                putting a stop to the proceeding of the Nagasaki officers. He
                                abstains from offering comment upon the dangerous consequences which
                                a revival of the persecution of native Christians is calculated to
                                occasion, until he is informed whether the Japanese government is
                                really responsible for so ill-advised a measure. He cannot suppose
                                it possible that after treating this important question with such
                                commendable moderation during the past year, the government of his
                                Majesty the Tenno should have suddenly entered on a contrary course,
                                opposed alike to the assurances they had given to the foreign
                                representatives and to the spirit of enlightenment and of progress
                                by which they have declared themselves to be guided. By such a
                                course Japan could not fail to forfeit the good opinion of all
                                western states, and to throw doubt upon the earnestness of her
                                professed desire to cultivate friendly relations with those
                                states.</p>
                            <p>Their excellencies cannot suppose that the undersigned, in presenting
                                this remonstrance to the government of the Tenno, seeks for a moment
                                to interfere in the internal affairs of Japan; but the unfortunate
                                proceedings of the Nagasaki officers above detailed justify him in
                                pointing out to his Majesty’s government that they should be
                                prepared, as he trusts is the case, to abstain from acts by which
                                the feelings of all the treaty powers wall be outraged, if they
                                really seek to maintain with those powers the cordial understanding
                                which the undersigned hoped had been established.</p>

                            <p>I received the letter in which your excellencies inform me that the
                                government has decided to remove the Christians of Urakami from
                                their homes, for the purpose of distributing them among various
                                daimios, under sentence of labor. According to the statement of your
                                excellencies, the arbitrary measure is in final execution of the one
                                carried out last year, the motive being to prevent quarrels between
                                those Christians and their neighbors interfering with the
                                established authority.</p>
                            <p>On the other hand, I learned from the intelligence received by me
                                from Nagasaki, that in compliance with instructions sent from Yeddo
                                since the 1st instant, the local authorities had already taken steps
                                to deport seven hundred of those unfortunate Christians, and that
                                all efforts to procure a delay had failed.</p>
                            <p>I intend to join my colleagues in examining a situation which, to me,
                                appears serious <pb n="459" xml:id="pg_459" facs="0493"/>in every
                                respect, but as several of them are absent from Yokohama I hasten to
                                earnestly protest against a cruel and unjust measure against
                                innocent people, whose only offense is the profession of the
                                Christian religion.</p>
                            <p>I shall not inquire to-day in how far the quarrels among the people
                                of Urakami, alleged as motive for their deportation, are justified
                                by facts; but I am enabled to state that no mention of any such
                                cause is made in his report by the vice-consul of France, who, on
                                the contrary, states that those Christians have invariably conducted
                                themselves as obedient subjects.</p>
                            <p>In conclusion, I must state that the course now adopted by the Mikado
                                is in direct opposition with declaration made to us in the beginning
                                of last year by the minister for foreign affairs.</p>

                            <p>S<hi rend="smallcaps">ir</hi>: The undersigned have already addressed
                                to their excellencies separate communications protesting against the
                                course which the government of his Majesty the Tenno are adopting
                                toward the native Christians of Urakami.</p>
                            <p>Before proceeding to report to their respective governments the
                                determination conveyed to them in their excellencies’ dispatch of
                                the 7th instant, which, if unfortunately persisted in, will be
                                received, they are convinced, by their respective governments with
                                deep regret, the undersigned think it wise to request a conference
                                with the general government, in order that they may urge on the
                                earnest attention of the latter the views which are likely to be
                                taken by all the treaty powers of the fresh persecution of native
                                Christians in Japan. They have therefore to propose that his
                                excellency the Hocho, and such other members of the government as
                                are authorized to deal with this question, should meet the
                                undersigned at Yeddo at one o’clock on the 19th instant, at such
                                place as their excellencies may find it convenient to indicate. They
                                have also to request that the government of his Majesty the Tenno
                                will, in the mean time, be so good as to instruct the local
                                authorities at Nagasaki, by the United States mail steamer leaving
                                Yokohama on the 20th instant, to suspend all proceedings against the
                                native Christians until the general government shall have maturely
                                considered the representations which the undersigned, animated by
                                the most friendly feeling toward Japan, conceive it to be their duty
                                to make to the government of his Majesty on this important
                                subject.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sirs:</hi> We have received your dispatch of the
                                11th January relative to the measures taken by the authorities of
                                Nagasaki with regard to native Christians, under instructions from
                                our government.</p>
                            <p>As you are aware, the profession of Christianity has been prohibited
                                in our country from ancient times; but in consequence of the promise
                                we made last year, that those Christians should be treated
                                leniently, they have been left undisturbed at their homes. Every
                                possible advice to change their Christian belief was given them. In
                                return they insulted the deities, thrones, and temples, quarreled
                                with the other inhabitants, and committed various lawless acts.</p>
                            <p>Should such acts be left unrestrained, the local administration would
                                be embarrassed and our government, having no other means, sent those
                                people to various other places to be educated. Orders were therefore
                                issued to Nagasaki to simply remove them and to inflict no
                                punishment whatever; and after careful consideration it was deemed
                                by our government that this is the most lenient measure that would
                                be adopted.</p>
                            <p>The particular circumstances, of which we believe you are not well
                                informed, will be communicated at our next interview. In the mean
                                time, we hasten to send the foregoing in reply to your dispatch.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> On the 18th instant a reply was
                                received from the Japanese minister of foreign affairs to the joint
                                note of the foreign representatives of the 17th instant, appointing
                                the following day, the 19th instant, for an interview at Yeddo with
                                the highest officers of state on the Christian question.</p>
                            <p>I accordingly proceeded thither in company with my colleagues, and I
                                now have the honor to submit herewith (inclosure No. 1) copy of a
                                memorandum of the interesting conference held on that occasion.</p>
                            <p>From this memorandum (your perusal of which I beg especially to
                                invite) you will perceive that the high officers of this empire
                                engaged themselves to reconsider this question, and that pending the
                                reconsideration the deportation of the native Christians from
                                Urakami should be suspended, and that no further persecutions of any
                                kind against them would in the mean time be entered into.</p>
                            <p>The apparent frankness with which this matter had been treated at the
                                conference by these high officers, and this apparent desire to
                                conciliate the good-will of the civilized world, was very
                                encouraging and reassuring to all of us foreign representatives, and
                                we returned that evening to Yokohama pleasantly impressed with the
                                idea that through coöperation and energy we had succeeded in this
                                highly delicate and difficult matter, in averting some evil, and in
                                laying a broad foundation for future success by continued
                                coöperation and remonstrances.</p>
                            <p>You may judge, then, of our surprise and chagrin when, on the day
                                before yesterday, the Pacific Mail Steamship Company’s steamer New
                                York arrived at this port bearing the unwelcome intelligence that
                                the governor of Nagasaki, acting under peremptory orders from the
                                Mikado’s government, had forestalled the reconsideration of this
                                question by deporting three thousand one hundred and seventy of
                                these unfortunate people—in fact all, or nearly all, of the native
                                Christians at Urakami.</p>
                            <p>From some cause unexplained and most annoying, no report of this
                                subsequent action was forwarded to me by this mail by our consul at
                                Nagasaki, but I am enabled, through the kindness of my colleague,
                                Mr. de Brandt, to send you the report received by him from his
                                consul at that port, a copy of which he most kindly furnished me,
                                and which I herewith transmit, marked inclosure No. 2.</p>
                            <p>I have further learned, both from the minister of France and the
                                German charge d’affaires, that some fears are entertained for the
                                safety of the Christian missionaries at Nagasaki, and the danger is
                                considered so urgent that the French minister has seen proper to
                                immediately send to that port the French gunboat Flamme.</p>
                            <p>From evidence received by me from unofficial sources and deemed
                                reliable, I am led to believe that in this deportation families were
                                separated with perfect ruthlessness, the men being sent to different
                                provinces as convicts to literally fulfill the original decree of
                                the Mikado against them, to wit, “that they should labor in the
                                mines and live in forests;” that the women, whether married or
                                single, were sent to houses of public resort, and the children so
                                distributed as to secure their being strictly educated in the Sintoo
                                    faith<hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the most unpardonable feature
                                of the affair, that these high officers of the Mikado government
                                must have known that this was already done, or being done, when they
                                accepted our proposition for a conference, and while at that
                                conference <pb n="461" xml:id="pg_461" facs="0495"/>they were
                                engaged in allaying oar anxieties by promises that further
                                proceedings should be stayed.</p>
                            <p>I must also state that I consider the evasion of the Mikado’s high
                                officers at the conference to inform us as to where these
                                unfortunates were to be sent as deliberate dissimulation upon their
                                parts, and I now do not doubt but that their argument for holding
                                the conference at a time when they knew that this deportation was
                                taking place was, instead of being, as we most fondly hoped, for the
                                honest purpose of trying to arrive with us at some understanding for
                                a satisfactory settlement of this matter, merely a device to gain
                                time to have these orders fully executed before any resistance to
                                their execution could be offered.</p>
                            <p>It may also be safely assumed that their assertions at the conference
                                that houses and lands are provided for these exiles is as baseless
                                as their assertions, made to us in that conference, to the effect
                                that the families of these Christians were not to be separated.</p>
                            <p>That these people have not been guilty of any other or further
                                offense against the government than that of becoming Christians is
                                doubtless true, and the statements of the Mikado’s officers at the
                                conference so often repeated, to the effect that these men were not
                                being punished on account of being Christians, but solely on account
                                of their seditious and rebellious practices, is proved to be
                                unfounded by the admissions made in the conference, that those of
                                them who had been formerly deported and who had recanted had been
                                returned, and also by the decree of the Mikado himself, which is
                                directed against Christians as such in express terms. The
                                difficulties of obtaining authentic information on all of these
                                points, when dealing with such authorities and in a country where we
                                have no means of obtaining any information from the interior where
                                those people are sent, will be apparent to you.</p>
                            <p>One advantage, however, as I consider it, has arisen from the
                                holdings of that conference.</p>
                            <p>We there obtained from these high officers the distinct and positive
                                avowal that the Mikado’s government is based upon the Sin too creed,
                                and for its perpetuity depends upon the maintenance of that faith at
                                all hazards. That they foresee in the propagation of Christianity
                                the overthrow of this faith and the consequent fall of the Mikado’s
                                dynasty, which <hi rend="italic">pro confesso</hi> has no other hold
                                upon the people or the princess than that engendered by the
                                idolatrous belief in the divinity of his origin; that they fear the
                                advance of Christianity more than they do the consequences of
                                wounding the sensibilities of the Christian powers, and, entrenching
                                themselves behind the legal shield of an abstract right on their
                                part to manage their own internal affairs without foreign
                                interposition, they intend by such practices as these to maintain
                                this faith and the government based upon it until forced to abandon
                                them.</p>
                            <p>That remonstrances on the part of the treaty powers’ representatives
                                will cause them to change this policy I do not for a moment
                                believe.</p>
                            <p>That it was the liberal foreign policy of the Tycoon’s government
                                that led to the rebellion and his overthrow is a well-established
                                fact. That the rebellion against his authority was incited by an
                                appeal to the antiforeign sentiments of the daimios and others is
                                certain, and that the Mikado’s party succeeded by this appeal in
                                seizing upon this government is an undoubted fact.</p>
                            <p>Hence, we have in this government one impliedly and expressly pledged
                                to hostility to foreigners and the Christian faith; and from such a
                                government, so intended and so committed, I can see no hopes of
                                effecting aught for important or general good relative to this
                                subject by simple remonstrances. Thus, then, the issue stands
                                framed; and thus <pb n="462" xml:id="pg_462" facs="0496"
                                />simplified, the Christian powers may now know the exact spirit and
                                disposition of this government relative to this question.</p>
                            <p>What further is to be done in the premises by me is a question I now
                                beg leave to submit to your superior judgment for determination.</p>
                            <p>In dealing with this question so far I have carefully governed myself
                                by the instructions given to my predecessor on this subject, and
                                which I was instructed by you to consider as applicable and binding
                                upon myself; but I feel that those instructions now stand exhausted,
                                and I most earnestly solicit other and further instructions upon
                                this matter, so full and complete that I may know the full extent to
                                which I may proceed should exigences of a very grave nature arise,
                                which is not improbable, as I fear that these authorities will
                                become much emboldened by the success of this movement, if they find
                                that for any considerable length of time it is allowed to pass unmet
                                by aught else than remonstrances and vague warnings.</p>
                            <p>I deeply regret this occurrence, which I am sure will shock the
                                civilized world.</p>
                            <p>I do not urge or recommend further action than already taken; but
                                that the struggle will continue between the attempted advances of
                                Christianity and idolatrous resistance is plainly to be foreseen,
                                and what serious results may soon follow again none can tell.</p>
                            <p>It is in the light of this apprehension that I ask for full and
                                explicit instructions.</p>
                            <p>In the mean time I shall content myself with following the course
                                which I have already pursued in concert with my colleagues, although
                                keenly conscious of its perfect inefficiency, as proved by the
                                circumstances now related.</p>
                            <p>For a more full understanding of the bearing of this question upon
                                the political affairs of Japan, so far as understood by me, I beg
                                leave to refer you to my dispatch No. 14, which is a political
                                summary.</p>

                                extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary; M. M.Outrey, minister

                            <p>At one o’clock p. m. the prime minister Sanjo opened the
                                conference.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sanjo:</hi> We have received and replied to the
                                notes of you gentlemen representatives of the foreign powers, and
                                now hold this personal interview to explain more fully the reasons
                                that have governed us in proceeding as we have done with regard to
                                the native Christians of Ukuwaura. Our government has always borne
                                in mind the promises it made at Osacca* <note n="*" xml:id="d282fn1"
                                    >Sanjo is mistaken, the promise was made at Yokohama.</note>
                                that it would not be severe in its treatment of these people, and I
                                now propose to explain how I have fulfilled that promise. Since last
                                year the government have had a full opportunity of discovering and
                                understanding the character of the Japanese people who profess
                                Christianity, and it has learned that they have become troublesome,
                                and if allowed to proceed unchecked will subvert all governmental
                                authority, interfere with trade, and seriously affect the relations
                                of this government with foreign nations.</p>
                            <p>This government does not move these people on account of their
                                religious professions’ but on account of their having been for a
                                long time ungovernable and insubordinate and on this account the
                                government has determined to change their residence.</p>
                            <p>The government heretofore removed some of them, and have treated them
                                with kindness <pb n="463" xml:id="pg_463" facs="0497"/>and those now
                                being removed are being treated in the same manner, and consequently
                                we do not think that we have destroyed or violated the promises made
                                by this government last year to the foreign representatives.</p>
                            <p>This government, in allotting to these people new residences, has not
                                been persecuting them. We have sent orders to Nagasaki that until
                                further orders are received, no more are to be removed. This has not
                                been done at the instance of the foreign representatives but on
                                account of our own conclusions arrived at in our own councils. Two
                                officers will leave on to-morrow bearing these orders.</p>
                            <p>These are the instructions of this government, and if the foreign
                                representatives now have any observations to make we would be
                                pleased to hear them.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir Harry Parkes:</hi> I have had every reason
                                for supposing that the decree of banishment of the native Christians
                                of Okuwaura had been reconsidered and was to remain inoperative. To
                                my great disappointment, I found, when at Nagasaki a few days since,
                                that that decree was being carried out and some seven hundred men
                                were to be banished. My own judgment of this, and I am sure it will
                                be of my government, is that this was a most cruel proceeding, and
                                the only reason assigned being that these people professed the
                                Christian religion, and that is the religion of my countrymen.</p>
                            <p>Such an act when known in England will produce a bad effect and be
                                looked upon as a most unfriendly act. It is my hope and trust that
                                my country may continue to have and hold the same friendly relations
                                with Japan that it has ever heretofore had; but such acts as this
                                are calculated to disturb these friendly relations, and for my own
                                part I cannot understand how you make out that there is no departure
                                on your part from the previous promises made to the foreign
                                representatives.</p>
                            <p>If a few of these people commit wrongs, punish them; but to visit
                                this punishment on families, and on thousands, is contrary to our
                                view of right. To my sense, this act is not in conformity with the
                                promises made by the Japanese government to us; and hence we have
                                sought this interview, hoping to arrive at some understanding that
                                will harmonize the acts of this government with its promises.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">M. Outrey.</hi> In my opinion there is a
                                misunderstanding about a word. You said you would act “mildly”
                                toward native Christians. I suppose the greatest punishment you
                                consider that you could inflict is death, and I suppose what you
                                mean by “mild treatment” is, that you will not <hi rend="italic"
                                    >kill</hi> them. This is not our understanding of “mild
                                treatment.” In our country it is regarded that a man taken from his
                                family and banished is most cruelly treated. According to the way we
                                understand those words, we reported that you would treat them
                                mildly: and now we have to report that they have been deported, that
                                is, banished and separated from their families. That cannot be
                                understood as “mild treatment” by our countrymen. My government has
                                most certainly a strong desire to cultivate kind relations with
                                Japan, but I fear that when these" reports reach it a great
                                excitement will ensue.</p>
                            <p>For my own sake I do assure you that my every feeling is of the
                                kindest nature for this government and people, and my every desire
                                is to promote in every way the kind relations between our
                                governments now existing.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Ewankura.</hi> There is a misunderstanding; we
                                consider that we have acted mildly, and as we promised. These
                                persons recently deported have had their families sent with them,
                                and this cannot be called severe punishment. They have lands
                                assigned them and an opportunity given them to make a living as they
                                had before. Heretofore the punishment for this offense was
                                crucifixion; this we had moderated at the request of the foreign
                                representatives, but you know that in Japan, where all the people
                                believe in one religion, that a sudden change or the sudden
                                introduction of a new religion would produce great and constant
                                political disturbances. Our object now is to converse on this
                                subject. If in the future we understand and believe it to be
                                necessary we will still execute this order. If it was only for those
                                people at Urakami believing in Christianity, this government would
                                never have thought of moving them. Whether it is on account of their
                                religious belief, or because bad persons seek refuge there, we do
                                not know; but trouble ensues, and the only way we know of correcting
                                it was dividing them up and sending them away. This is done solely
                                on account of their acts of insubordination.</p>
                            <p>M. <hi rend="smallcaps">Outrey.</hi> This is not in accordance with
                                the letter you wrote us. I will ask what are those things in which
                                they are disobedient? Is it because they profess Christianity or
                                not?</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sawa.</hi> I was myself for a long time governor
                                of Nagasaki, and I know all about these people. What I now say is
                                that it is not owing to the influence of missionaries that criminals
                                from neighboring daimios’ clans take refuge in these Christian
                                villages, are there received; they then profess Christianity, are
                                baptized, &amp;c., and when the government officers seek to
                                apprehend them collisions ensue between these Christians and the
                                forces sent to apprehend them, while, in fact, these men are
                                robbers.</p>
                            <p>M. <hi rend="smallcaps">Outrey.</hi> I wonder that you have the power
                                to punish a whole village, and not a few persons in it. There is
                                contradiction here.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sawa.</hi> I did not mean to say that we could
                                not arrest them, but that the whole people of the village would
                                resist our officers, pretending that the man was being arrested <pb
                                    n="464" xml:id="pg_464" facs="0498"/>on account of his religions
                                faith, when really it was for some crime he had committed.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Teraschima.</hi> The villagers among themselves
                                are extremely hostile toward those in the same village not of the
                                same religions faith; that is, among our people it is quite usual
                                for one to help another in necessity by making little loans of salt
                                or provisions. When asked such favors these Christians would not
                                grant them unless the others would profess Christianity; and many
                                have thus been starved or driven into professing Christianity. Their
                                conduct has been constantly overbearing. They have not come to open
                                hostilities, but they have pursued a system of vexation and
                                intimidation so oppressive that it has led many to leave. They also
                                find ways of spreading reports about their treatment by which
                                sometimes foreign representatives are deceived.</p>
                            <p>M. <hi rend="smallcaps">Outrey.</hi> I have not received such
                                reports.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Teraschima.</hi> The only thing we intend to do
                                is to get them where we can control them and correct them.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sawa.</hi> The upshot of this matter is that we
                                do not move these people on account of their profession of the
                                Christian faith, but on account of their actions, and this
                                government would have pursued the same course with any other people;
                                and unless we do this we do not know how we will govern them.</p>
                            <p>M. <hi rend="smallcaps">Outrey. How</hi> many people?</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sawa.</hi> About five thousand.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">M. Outrey. How</hi> many Christians?</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sawa.</hi> About three thousand.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">M. Outrey.</hi> Three thousand are troubling two
                                thousand, and you remove the three thousand.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sawa.</hi> Yes.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">M. Outrey.</hi> I thought there was four
                                thousand, according to this decree.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sawa.</hi> This included native Christians in
                                neighboring villages.</p>
                            <p>Mr. D<hi rend="smallcaps">e Long.</hi> Has the decree of deportation
                                which was published last year been repealed or amended?</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sawa.</hi> It was left in abeyance for awhile on
                                account of our internal troubles. It has not been repealed or
                                amended.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Teraschima.</hi> We were prevented from carrying
                                it out, also, on account of the expenses we would have had to incur,
                                these Christians not being treated as criminals, but they were
                                provided with houses and lands, besides their number being very
                                large. We have hoped the respite given them would induce them to
                                amend their ways. In this we were mistaken.</p>
                            <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">De Long.</hi> Then the decree now being
                                inforced is the original decree?</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sawa.</hi> Yes, but in a milder form; and we
                                shall explain the difference to you.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Teraschima.</hi> Formerly only the men were to
                                be deported; now they are not separated from their families, and
                                will even be furnished lands and houses.</p>
                            <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">De Long.</hi> When was this last decree
                                issued?</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sawa.</hi> On the 19th of last month.</p>
                            <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">De Long.</hi> But you never reported the
                                decree to us.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sawa.</hi> I wrote you a dispatch on the
                                subject.</p>
                            <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">De Long.</hi> But you informed me in that
                                dispatch that you were executing the former decree. I should like an
                                answer to my question, which is, Is the former decree being
                                executed, or has a new one been issued?</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sawa.</hi> We shall explain the matter; orders
                                were sent formerly——</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Teraschima.</hi> Orders were formerly sent to
                                Nagasaki. Their execution was prevented from internal reasons, and
                                also on account of the representations of the foreign ministers. Now
                                milder orders have been sent.</p>
                            <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">De Long.</hi> Why then did you declare in
                                your letter to me that you were but enforcing the original decree;
                                and why did you not give me notice of these modifications you <hi
                                    rend="italic">now</hi> speak of?</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sawa.</hi> The fault is mine. I expressed myself
                                badly, but now I have given you the explanations.</p>
                            <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">De Long.</hi> In what respect are the new
                                orders different from the old?</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sawa.</hi> Formerly only the men were deported;
                                now they are left together with their families. There is a marked
                                difference between these two decrees of punishment—the former much
                                the most severe.</p>
                            <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">De Long. How</hi> many people have been sent
                                away under these last orders?</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sawa.</hi> Up to the 6th day of this month five
                                hundred men were sent. The women and children were to be sent the
                                next day.</p>
                            <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">De Long.</hi> Where were they sent to?</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Teraschima.</hi> We do not exactly know; we only
                                know they had left.</p>
                            <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">De Long,</hi> How then can you know that
                                they are provided with houses and lands?</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Teraschima.</hi> From one of the sinjo
                                (counsellor) we have reports on these subjects, but do not know the
                                details by heart.</p>
                            <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">De Long.</hi> Where were they sent?</p>
                            <pb n="465" xml:id="pg_465" facs="0499"/>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Teraschima.</hi> I cannot exactly tell; some to
                                other parts of Kiu Siu, some to Chosin.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sawa.</hi> You can rest assured that we will not
                                separate the women and children from the men.</p>
                            <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">De Long.</hi> Am I right in understanding
                                that you will at once take steps to suspend any further proceedings
                                under this order?</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sawa.</hi> Orders have been issued to that
                                effect.</p>
                            <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">De Long.</hi> I wish to state to you, as I
                                have often done before, that my Government feels a most lively
                                interest in the affairs and prosperity of this empire. It wishes to
                                aid you in every possible way, and has no single intent or feeling
                                to serve, but will find fulfillments in your increasing prosperity,
                                but such action as this on the part of your government will send a
                                thrill of horror throughout the United States, where freedom of
                                religious belief is granted to all, and yet where the Christian
                                religion is almost universally professed.</p>
                            <p>It is not too much for me to say that this action may chill the warm
                                tide of governmental good-will that is now flowing to you from the
                                United States, and by proceeding further in this course you may
                                change that mighty nation, your nearest treaty neighbor, into a
                                hostile power. I warn you to pause, for I doubt that the Christian
                                world will quietly submit to seeing people thus banished into
                                slavery for no other offense than that of having become convinced of
                                the truths of Christianity and professing their convictions; and
                                from what you have here stated I concur with my colleagues in
                                assuring you of my convictions that this people that you are
                                punishing, you are proceeding against for no other reason than the
                                simple one that they have become converts to Christianity.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sawa.</hi> I am ready to withdraw my former
                                letter to you, and address you and them, giving you fuller
                                explanations.</p>
                            <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">De Long.</hi> I would be much pleased to
                                hear any further explanations you may have to offer of your action,
                                and especially do I desire that you will inform me of the exact
                                nature of this decree that you are executing, if it differs from the
                                former one; but as your former letter has been placed on file in my
                                legation, and now constitutes a portion of its archives, I must
                                respectfully decline to allow you to recall it.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Ewankura. To</hi> enable us to maintain friendly
                                relations with foreign powers it is absolutely necessary for us to
                                be able to govern our own people, and we are therefore obliged to
                                carry out these measures against the Urakami people. The foreign
                                minister misconstrued our acts, and in order to give them a proof of
                                our good will we acted as we have done, and sent contrary orders to
                                Nagasaki, but we should like very much to be enabled to carry out
                                our former orders, and it is a bad thing for a government to recall
                                orders once given.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Von Brandt.</hi> I have but little to add to
                                what has been said by my colleagues. We wish to continue friendly
                                relations. This action will appear to the people of Germany like a
                                proceeding against Christians. We recognize the right of this
                                government to manage its own internal affairs, and to that end to
                                arrest and punish malefactors; but I cannot avoid the impression
                                that this proceeding is a proceeding against Christians as such, for
                                their professions of that faith. This impression is much
                                strengthened by the manifestoes and proclamations of this government
                                being directed against Christians. No government more readily than
                                Germany will recognize the right of this government to preserve
                                order, and none will object or interfere more reluctantly than the
                                German with the exercise of that right.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Ewankura.</hi> If this government has prohibited
                                the Christian religion in Japan, it is not because it is opposed to
                                it, but because we foresee great troubles to ensue from it, as, for
                                instance, if one man in a hundred becomes converted to that faith it
                                would lead to a splitting up and dividing of the people. Formerly
                                the laws against this were very strict; now they are three or four
                                degrees milder than formerly, but we cannot allow it to be professed
                                generally.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Von Brandt.</hi> We do not ask you to allow the
                                free exercise of it, but we do ask that men who do profess it shall
                                not be punished for professing it; in this there is a great
                                distinction. I ask no change of laws, but simply to allow those who
                                do profess Christianity to remain without being tortured for their
                                faith.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Ewankura.</hi> You must consider the motives of
                                our government, as, for instance, the native Christians formerly
                                sent from this village to Chosin are all to be returned now, as they
                                have recanted their professing of Christianity.</p>
                            <p>M. <hi rend="smallcaps">Outrey.</hi> This is a contradiction. This
                                proves that it was because they professed Christianity that they
                                were punished, as now that they have recanted their punishment
                                ceases. If all would now publicly recant their professions of
                                Christianity would they all be allowed to remain?</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Ewankura.</hi> Yes; if they follow the religion
                                of their emperor, and obey the authority of the government, no
                                reason for their punishment exists.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">M. Outrey.</hi> Then it is plain they are being
                                punished because they are Christians.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Yon Brandt.</hi> We appeal to you as you would
                                to us, in behalf of any number of our countrymen in our own country,
                                who might profess the religion of Japan, (a religion which we
                                respect,) if our government should seek to punish these men for so
                                doing, <pb n="466" xml:id="pg_466" facs="0500"/>and we ask you to
                                consider this appeal as you would wish such an one of your own
                                considered.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">M. Outrey.</hi> We respect your religion.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Teraschima.</hi> If I said that this was being
                                done on account of the religion of these men, it was only true in
                                one sense, but the main reason is that in consequence of their
                                professing the Christian religion, they despise their own. According
                                to the Sintoo religion, the Mikado is the direct descendant of the
                                spirit; thus he rules by divine right, and on account of his divine
                                origin. Christianity teaches our people to despise and disbelieve
                                this feature of our faith, and thus it brings this sacred thing into
                                contempt. As, for instance, these Christians, instead of going to
                                the Sintoo temple in Owakara, sacred to the Mikado, and worshipping,
                                they refuse to do it, and thus treat the Mikado contemptuously, and
                                lead others to disrespect him.</p>
                            <p>M. <hi rend="smallcaps">Outrey.</hi> How comes it, if this is the
                                reason of your opposition to Christians and Christianity, that you
                                do not punish the Buddhists? The Mikado is the chief of the Sin too
                                faith, and he cannot be the chief of more than one religion.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Teraschima.</hi> The Buddhists show their
                                respect to the Sintoo faith by agreeing to this principle.</p>
                            <p>M. <hi rend="smallcaps">Outrey</hi> Yes; but they have their own
                                temples and priests. Do they compel them to go to the Sintoo temples
                                and pay their respect?</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Ewankura.</hi> In Japan, whether Buddhists or
                                not, they have respect for, and adore the Tensio Daisen, the
                                ancestor of the Mikado, as such, but Christians do not. They insult
                                and ridicule her, and of course thereby insult and ridicule the
                                Mikado.</p>
                            <p>V<hi rend="smallcaps">on Brandt.</hi> How do they insult, her?</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Teraschima.</hi> In Owakura, at this temple of
                                Tensio Daisen, they have a peculiar gate sacred to the Mikado
                                ancestor. These Christians never will go through this gate, but go
                                around it, and thus show all the people how they despise the
                                goddess, and teach others to despise her also. Then, in all Sintoo
                                houses, the people have idols, family gods, and also sacred
                                writings; they insult these idols, and put the sacred writings in
                                indecent and filthy places, to show the people how they despise
                                them.</p>
                            <p>M. <hi rend="smallcaps">Outrey.</hi> Was this done in their own
                                houses?</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Teraschima.</hi> There is a place there called
                                Shima Carn, with several little red gates, and inside grass grows,
                                which people gather, and they will throw this grass through these
                                gates and go around after it, rather than pass through them. This
                                action itself may be small, but the feeling exhibited is great, and
                                shows disrespect to the Mikado and his ancestor. The systems of
                                government here and in Europe, you must bear in mind, are different.
                                There the people have more or less to do with the government; here,
                                they have nothing to do with it; and to maintain this government it
                                is absolutely necessary for us to compel all the people to believe
                                in the divine origin of the Mikado, and respect and reverence him
                                and his ancestors. Thus the Tycoon’s government ceased to answer the
                                purpose, as many of the daimios refused obedience to the Shogoon,
                                saying he had no authority to govern them, and hence it became
                                necessary for the Mikado to assume charge of the government, being
                                the one they all acknowledged has the divine right to rule. To carry
                                out this idea it is necessary for us to maintain this religion, and
                                to put down all that oppose it, or we would have no government.</p>
                            <p>Sir <hi rend="smallcaps">Harry Parkes.</hi> (After consulting with
                                all of his colleagues, and in their name made the subsequent
                                declaration.) We have listened to all that has been said, and I must
                                state very plainly that our impressions are that this proceeding,
                                against this people at Owakura, is on account of their being
                                Christians. Now I must again repeat that to persecute this people on
                                that account must be offensive to all the treaty powers. You are
                                oppressing them because they profess the faith that we do, and this
                                must be offensive to us. We do not doubt your intentions, nor do we
                                doubt your desire, and that of the government, to maintain friendly
                                relations with all the treaty powers, and I come with my colleagues
                                because I foresee, in your persistence in this cause, great trouble
                                in the future. We beg you to reconsider your action; we do not come
                                desiring to add one particle to your embarrassments, but to urge
                                upon you our views, that this course will disturb our friendly
                                relations; and having these views, it is our duty to come to you and
                                point out the danger. You have told us that you will suspend these
                                proceedings. For this we thank you, and we now beg you to examine
                                this question, and we hope you will see that it will be unnecessary
                                to remove the residue of these people, as Mr. Ewankura just now
                                intimated.</p>
                            <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Outrey. You</hi> must remember that these
                                questions will severely affect our people, and in Europe, where the
                                people have much to do with the government, they will affect the
                                government in time; you must recognize the state of European
                                government.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">De Long.</hi> More particularly is this the case
                                in the United States of America, which is a government of the
                                people, where all men are permitted to entertain and practice any
                                religion they may believe; and they profess the same faith
                                (Christian) for embracing which you so severely punish this
                                people.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Yon Brandt.</hi> I most heartily concur with my
                                colleagues in asking a suspension of the execution of this order,
                                and your most earnest reconsideration of the whole matter.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Ewankura.</hi> It comes quite under the reasons
                                that we give that the influence of the <pb n="467" xml:id="pg_467"
                                    facs="0501"/>people in Europe in the government is great; so it
                                is here in Japan, and here the people are not in favor of the
                                introduction of the Christian religion. This government is absolute,
                                and if they allow this to be discharged the government cannot be
                                carried on, because the government is based on this religion. By it
                                the Mikado assumed control and now reigns, and by this reason we are
                                obliged to repress Christianity, but do not like to do it so as to
                                give offense. I hope this will be understood.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Teraschima.</hi> In referring these religious
                                questions to the treaties it will be seen that the engagements are
                                mutual; that foreigners in Japan can have their own places of
                                worship, and practice their own religions, and that neither are to
                                disturb the other. This at least is the spirit of the treaty. Now,
                                although we have given foreigners their own places of worship, and
                                have never interfered with them, we have found out that missionaries
                                have established a place of worship at Owakura, not within the
                                limits of the foreign settlement, where they go at night and preach
                                their faith.</p>
                            <p>M. <hi rend="smallcaps">Outrey.</hi> They must not have this; this is
                                the first I have heard of it.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Teraschima.</hi> Although it is not, perhaps,
                                according to the letter of the treaty that foreigners’ places of
                                worship should not be attended by Japanese, we consider that
                                foreigners have no right to go inside of the settlement propagating
                                their faith, as they are doing. It appears to this government that
                                these missionaries have also led these people so to act as to
                                implicate them seriously. That they have promised them assistance if
                                troubled by our government is evidenced by the fact that when we
                                attempt to control them they always rush to these priests and
                                complain to them. That we ought sooner to come forward with our
                                complaints against these priests we admit, and we are very sorry
                                that we have not done it; but thinking that the shortest way would
                                be to deal with our own subjects, we have let it go on. Now we
                                regret this; for if we had sooner complained it would have resulted
                                in only ten or a hundred being moved.</p>
                            <p>M. <hi rend="smallcaps">Outrey.</hi> I regret that you have never
                                informed us of this; but I wish to say this persecution commenced
                                four years ago, and this shows that the more they are persecuted the
                                more they increase; and we know that at a place in the interior
                                where there were no priests, you have had to persecute these people
                                for Christianity; and this we know from your own official
                                newspaper.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Teraschima.</hi> That is true. But there are
                                Japanese who are preaching Christianity.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">M. Outrey. Do</hi> you not know that in the time
                                of the Tycoon your government suddenly heard of four or five
                                thousand native Christians? Were they not Christians from their
                                fathers? And does not this prove that the more you persecute the
                                more Christians there will be?</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Teraschima.</hi> It is possible that those were
                                people who were Christians before this; if so, they kept it still.
                                The government was not going so far as to try and find out the
                                sentiments of a man’s heart, and punish him for that; but these men
                                are seditious, and we cannot tolerate them. We will not say the
                                missionaries advise this; but the people do defy the government. The
                                officers from Nagasaki inform us that they have turned one of the
                                ten temples there into a place of worship, and there the people
                                assemble and await the missionaries, who come in the night and
                                perform religious worship.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">M. Outrey.</hi> Destroy the houses there, and
                                stop it if it is not within the treaty limits.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Teraschima.</hi> These missionaries employ
                                two-sworded men, who are outcasts, as sub-instructors, who go about
                                teaching, and it is owing to these that Christianity is propagated
                                inland. Now, the reason we move these people is to take them from
                                under the influence of these missionaries. To say the truth, Orokami
                                and other such villages have become the asylum of outcasts, and
                                there they congregate and claim that they are under the protection
                                of foreign powers. I know well these people have been led to believe
                                so.</p>
                            <p>M. <hi rend="smallcaps">Outrey.</hi> We certainly have never any of
                                us, or our consuls, given them any such assurances, and we have
                                never heard of this before. We trust you will reconsider your
                                actions, because it will cause great feeling in Europe and America,
                                and may lead to serious results. We ask postponement and due
                                reflection.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Ewankura.</hi> I can only repeat that we desire
                                friendly relations, but we must be allowed to govern our own people.
                                We thank you for your evidence of friendliness, and we will send
                                orders to postpone further actions pending this conference, and in
                                this conference it will depend whether we go further or not. We have
                                spoken of the wrongs of the missionaries, which you ministers cannot
                                defend; and we hope it is in the power of you ministers to control
                                these missionaries, whether they will behave or not.</p>
                            <p>M. <hi rend="smallcaps">Outrey.</hi> We will do what we can to make
                                our people in all cases do right.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">De Long.</hi> I state, unhesitatingly, that when
                                any complaint is made to me of a Wrong done by any American citizen,
                                I shall always be as ready and willing to restrain or punish him, as
                                I am prompt to demand redress for my countrymen from this government
                                when I consider them aggrieved.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Ewankura.</hi> I am very much pleased with this
                                frank and open expression of your opinion, and by this remark I
                                judge that we will, no doubt, be able to come to some understanding,
                                which will save the necessity of further deportation. We will then

                                and meet another day. The council agreed four or five days ago to
                                stop these proceedings, and an officer will leave to-morrow to
                                suspend them. Sawa and Taraschima will further confer with you upon
                                this subject as you may please, and with this we adjourn this
                                conference.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have the honor to inform you that
                                the persecution against the native Christians, which had been
                                suspended in 1868, has been resumed by the Japanese authorities of
                                this port with an energy worthy of a better cause. Already a number
                                of 3,170 souls— men, women, and children, residing in this
                                vicinity—have been placed on board of various vessels, which sailed
                                from here for different provinces of Japan to be educated there.</p>
                            <p>On learning this measure, having for object the tearing asunder of
                                all social ties among these unfortunate people, as parents are
                                separated from their children and husbands from their wives, to be
                                distributed and isolated, the consuls of the treaty powers at this
                                port, moved by sympathy for the victims of such barbaric treatment,
                                united in a letter to the governor of this port, copy of which I
                                have the honor to transmit, inclosed herewith. No explanation of the
                                joint note is needed.</p>
                            <p>At a conference, which all the consuls of the treaty powers attended
                                by invitation of the governor of Nagasaki, in pursuance of their
                                joint note, the representatives of the Japanese government verbally
                                announced to us that in this matter of the deportation of Japanese
                                Christians he simply carried out the instructions which had been
                                sent him by the Mikado government, and the execution of those
                                instructions he could on no consideration delay or suspend.</p>
                            <p>Neither the remonstrances of the consuls against this barbaric
                                measure, though couched in friendly and courteous language, nor the
                                reference to judgment, which the civilized world will not fail to
                                pronounce in regard to it, had the slightest effect whatever, either
                                in obtaining a postponement of this severe and inhuman purpose or a
                                modification of its execution. Several vessels, foreign and native,
                                also steamers, have sailed from this port and from the Bay of
                                Tokitu, on board of which the Japanese Christians have been sent to
                                places which, notwithstanding my best and repeated endeavors, I have
                                found it impossible to ascertain. All questions in this respect the
                                Japanese authorities answered evasively by saying that those people
                                would be sent to different provinces.</p>
                            <p>The deportation of the Christians has taken place without creating
                                the slightest disturbance among the remainder of the population.</p>
                            <p>The Japanese Christians chiefly resided at Urakami, a village
                                situated at the head of this bay; at Ipongi, another village, and in
                                the vicinity, and also the town of Nagasaki.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir: A</hi> few days ago the Prince of Satsuma
                            suddenly returned from Yedo to his province with a portion of his
                            forces; the remainder are reported to be still guarding the Mikado in
                            the castle at the capital.</p>
                        <p>As on former occasions, whenever that powerful daimio approaches the
                            Mikado, his former confederates, the Princes of Choshu and Tosa, are
                            known to be narrowly watching his proceedings, and all the other great
                            daimios hold themselves aloof; and, on the other hand, as soon as Prince
                            Satsuma returns to his province, other princes more or less show an
                            inclination to counteract the influence which the ambitious prince is
                            suspected of exercising. Yet the most absolute reserve continues to be
                            generally maintained by the daimios in their intercource with the
                            Mikado’s government.</p>
                        <pb n="469" xml:id="pg_469" facs="0503"/>
                        <p>In former times, when the law of compulsory residence at the capital for
                            daimios was in force, the Tycoon, or Shogung, then the sovereign of
                            Japan, was surrounded at his court by all the princes. This court was an
                            exhibition of sovereign power, and the imperial display was deemed
                            essential to the proper enforcement of the law and the maintenance of
                            tranquillity in the empire.</p>
                        <p>It is not surprising, therefore, that the Mikado’s advisers, even since
                            his Majesty’s accession to power by the half forced and half voluntary
                            withdrawal of the late Tycoon, should have endeavored to bring about
                            such a gathering of daimios around the imperial throne.</p>
                        <p>All their efforts in this respect have failed. The Mikado was considered,
                            as heretofore, in the light of a mere political abstraction, without
                            inherent strength of his own, and whose claim to govern was only based
                            on an alleged divine origin, which no one hitherto thought it worth
                            while to question.</p>
                        <p>The daimios, therefore, only reluctantly yield a nominal obedience, and
                            persistently, under some plea or other, have excused themselves from
                            personal attendance at the Mikado’s court.</p>
                        <p>The imperial advisers, thus baffled in their attempts to compel a cordial
                            recognition of the Mikado’s sovereign claims, issued a decree abolishing
                            all daimios, reducing them in rank to simple noblemen, and appointing
                            them governors of their respective provinces, though removable at the
                            Mikado’s pleasure. And when this decree, as might have been expected,
                            failed to produce the desired result, and remained unnoticed and
                            unacknowledged, even by means of respectful remonstrances, another one
                            was issued, appointing leading relations of daimios as Mikado’s
                            officers, to act as censors in his Majesty’s behalf with and over the
                            governments of their provinces. This second decree fared worse than the
                            first, and even led, in some instances, to acts amounting to overt
                            contempt of the Mikado’s authority.</p>
                        <p>More immediately pressing, embarrassments had, however, first to be
                            disposed of. The rice crop had been a failure, and food had to be
                            provided for the large population of Yedo, Kioto, and Osacca, among whom
                            riots had to be prevented at all costs. The population of those cities
                            are dissatisfied with the prevailing stagnation of trade; and, in
                            addition, the people of Kioto, owing to the continued absence of the
                            Mikado, claim to have a political grievance against Yedo, on a question
                            of supremacy or precedence of their city as the true capital of
                            Japan.</p>
                        <p>Rice, therefore, has been, and continues to be, largely imported from
                            abroad, and is distributed by the government in the three cities named,
                            in some cases gratuitously or below cost. With the rice in the
                            government storehouse, the supply held by merchants, and that now afloat
                            on the way to this country, it may fairly be presumed that the greatest
                            apprehension of the government has been removed, and that this winter
                            will pass without disturbances among the large city population.</p>
                        <p>The necessary measure being, perhaps, one of self-preservation, has
                            involved a large expenditure on the part of the government; and that
                            this has been in excess of the revenue is clearly shown by the necessity
                            under which they found themselves placed of contracting a loan from
                            foreigners, a step which they would undoubtedly have avoided if
                            possible, for it proves that they are unable to borrow from their own
                            people, or to inforce new taxes, and, further, that they risk to incur
                            further unpopularity in view of the anti-foreign feeling, through the
                            active strength of which they established their authority.</p>
                        <p>This anti-foreign feeling, though quite personal, appears to be strongest
                            and most uncompromising with the class of independent gentry or <pb
                                n="470" xml:id="pg_470" facs="0504"/>country squires residing in the
                            provinces surrounding Kioto. They are estimated to number at least
                            twenty thousand men, and appear to have their headquarters at a place
                            named Tots Kawa, though they are known to have no political
                            organization. At that place they even barred the Mikado’s progress, on
                            the occasion of his coming to Yedo, and they were with difficulty
                            induced to peaceably disperse.</p>
                        <p>It is through this place that the Mikado will soon again have to pass, if
                            he should be forced to yield to the urgent demands now being made upon
                            him to return to Kioto, in order to assert his spiritual power and
                            perform the customary rites at the tombs of his ancestors, in compliance
                            with prevailing superstition. It seems to be unquestioned that in this
                            direction the Sintoo priesthood is now applying a vigorous pressure,
                            with the ulterior object, no doubt, of at the same time securing some
                            more definite action, in redemption of the pledges made on the occasion
                            of the assumption, by the Mikado, of sovereign power in secular affairs,
                            that their creed would become the prevailing one in this empire, to the
                            exclusion or extirpation of all others.</p>
                        <p>Although all the foregoing well-known facts have been more fully set
                            forth in former dispatches, I deemed that this brief summary would be
                            acceptable in view of the undoubted and intimate connection which exists
                            between the general state of affairs in this country and the
                            Christianity question, submitted in dispatches of this series, and then
                            more readily enable you to appreciate that difficulty in the political
                            bearing.</p>
                        <p>Unaccountable as it seemed at first sight, why, at this present juncture
                            of accumulating internal complications, liable at any moment to be
                            rendered still more embarrassing by anticipated hostilities breaking out
                            afresh among daimios, the Mikado’s government should have acted in a
                            manner likely to place their friendly relations with foreign powers in
                            jeopardy. I have, after a careful review of all the facts, arrived at
                            the conclusion that there is but one way of explaining the course
                            adopted by the Mikado’s government on this occasion, and that the
                            motives for their action, however extraordinary it appears on the
                            surface, must be sought and can only be found in the extreme necessities
                            of the situation, calling for extreme measures to meet and overcome
                            them.</p>
                        <p>It is quite clear that, by the deportation of over three thousand native
                            Christians, the Mikado’s government contemplated to conciliate the
                            Sintoo priesthood, the bigoted country squires and all those numerous
                            daimio’s retainers and others in all parts of Japan, who are only by
                            their own quarrels and feuds with their neighbors prevented from forming
                            and organizing themselves into a great national anti-foreign party,
                            which, if it were possible, would be overwhelming in its strength and
                            unanimity on that basis.</p>
                        <p>The ostentatious manner in which the deportation was consummated,
                            including the formal reception in conference, at Yedo, of the foreign
                            representatives, who on all occasions annouuced their presence in the
                            capital by flying their flags; the conspicuous place on a great
                            thoroughfare selected for that conference, and the minute subdivision of
                            that large body of native Christians among the greatest possible number
                            of daimios, are all so many reasons, showing that the greatest publicity
                            was intended, and has probably obtained for the measure, as an
                            exhibition of strength of the Mikado’s government, of their independence
                            of foreign opinion, thus flattering the proud anti-foreign feeling
                            existing, and if successful in being acknowledged as evidence of real
                            power, it is no doubt hoped that it may equally be successful in
                            eliciting a more than nominal recognition from the daimios, without
                            whose active support <pb n="471" xml:id="pg_471" facs="0505"/>or
                            implicit obedience a Mikado’s government, or any other government, can
                            hardly be expected to prove more than a sham.</p>
                        <p>The Mikado’s government is perfectly aware, having been emphatically
                            reminded to that effect, of the impression this act of deportation will
                            not fail to create in the civilized world, and with the governments of
                            the treaty powers, but having on so many occasions received official
                            assurances of friendly feeling, they may be presumed to trust that this
                            friendly feeling, though altered by this cruel act of persecution, will
                            not lead beyond energetic remonstrances; and to the official existence
                            of those now in power, the considerations which, led to its adoption and
                            execution are no doubt perfectly excusable on the plea of immediate
                            necessity.</p>
                        <p>The Mikado’s original decree prescribes that those unfortunate people
                            shall work in mines and live in forests, and this suggests, as there is
                            a general desire now manifested in Japan to work mines of gold, silver,
                            and coal, and as in many provinces a strong dislike is said to exist on
                            the part of laborers, to trust themselves in the volcanic country at any
                            depth below the surface of the soil, that those native Christians whose
                            superstitious scruples in any respect are not likely to meet with much
                            consideration will be made useful as pioneers in this important branch
                            of the development of the immense mineral resources of this country.</p>
                        <p>While thus the Mikado’s government yields to the bigotry and fanaticism
                            of the many, courts their support by flattering their superstition, and
                            endeavors to turn it to advantage with the aid of the Sintoo priesthood,
                            by obtaining from and through them a renewed recognition of the divine
                            right of their chief, they at the same time combat the superstition
                            against working in deep shafts, among their country people, who appear
                            to be apprehensive that while digging for a vein they may strike an
                            earthquake.</p>
                        <p>It now remains to be seen what effect this bold and unscrupulous policy
                            of the Mikado’s government will produce, and in what manner they will
                            follow it up, to insure the continuance in office of those who now
                            exercise authority.</p>
                        <p>It may be expected that as, with them, the end justifies the means under
                            all circumstances, that more high-handed proceedings will flow from
                            those so recklessly inaugurated.</p>
                        <p>Purchases of arms and munitions by daimios continue. The Oneida,
                            Commander Williams, sails to-morrow, and there will then be no national
                            vessel in this country, except the storeship Idaho, recently disabled in
                            a typhoon.</p>

                            and I have but just time sufficient to transmit to you a couple of
                            reports, made by the native governor of Nagasaki to the Mikado’s
                            government, relative to the number of native Christians deported by him
                            from Urakami, their <pb n="472" xml:id="pg_472" facs="0506"
                            />destination, treatment, &amp;c., and which were by the government just
                            transmitted to me. From these you will learn their own account of the
                            manner in which this business was transacted, and to this you can of
                            course attach such importance and credence as you may see proper. It is
                            probable that these statements have been prepared and furnished with a
                            view on the part of this government of allaying, as far as possible, the
                            feeling abroad which this deportation is likely to create, and
                            undoubtedly it is as favorably stated as the truth will allow. These
                            reports fail to change in the least my former views of the subject, or
                            of the intended treatment of these exiles, as I have explained to you in
                            my dispatch No. 13 of this series.</p>

                            <p>We beg to report that up to yesterday we continued sending off the
                                native Christians to various Provinces as set forth in accompanying
                                paper, taking good care, in conformity with the instructions
                                received, to treat them kindly and tendering them advice. Heads of
                                families were provided with money and the sick who applied for
                                relief were sent into hospital. The old and infirm were furnished
                                with sedan chairs in places whole the road was rough, and sandals
                                for travelers were given to all. Families were not separated in
                                accordance with instructions, but some were sent to different places
                                at their own request. We allowed them to take whatever they required
                                of their own goods, and such as were left behind were placed in
                                strong warehouses to await your further orders as to its disposal.
                                As it was exceedingly cold and snow falling at the time, we
                                furnished all with sake (rice whisky) to use on the road as and when
                                they pleased. Strict orders were given by us to those officers who
                                accompanied them to provide whatever could contribute to their
                                comfort. It was clearly explained to them that all reasonable wants
                                they may have shall be duly supplied in the provinces whither they
                                are sent, and they all left cheerfully and in good spirits.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: On the 28th ultimo the Japanese ministers
                            for foreign affairs came to this place for the purpose of holding an
                            interview with the foreign <pb n="473" xml:id="pg_473" facs="0507"
                            />representatives on the Christianity question, but previous engagements
                            preventing a meeting on that day, the Japanese ministers returned to
                            Yedo and then made their statement in writing.</p>
                        <p>I transmit herewith inclosure No. 1, copy of their letter, covering a
                            memorandum on this important subject, marked “confidential,” as desired.
                            In pursuance of an agreement to that effect the Japanese ministers came
                            again yesterday, when a joint conference was held with them. On that
                            occasion the Japanese ministers in substance repeated what they had
                            already stated verbally and in writing. They promised that no more
                            native converts to Christianity would be deported from Nagasaki, but as
                            information had been received from foreign sources that diligent search
                            is still being made by the authorities at that port and its vicinity for
                            such native converts who are suspected of being concealed, their
                            promises did not appear to possess any appreciable value.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese ministers further requested that propositions for the
                            settlement of the Christianity question be made by the foreign
                            representatives, but in the absence of instructions that have been
                            applied for, I did not feel justified in venturing beyond the suggestion
                            that the native Christians already deported should be returned to their
                            homes.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese government assert that the action and the teaching of some
                            foreign missionaries have caused serious disturbances, and that they
                            regard Christianity only from a political point of view. They persist in
                            considering it an aggressive movement, and are apparently determined to
                            put down proselytism at all hazards and with all the means at their
                            command.</p>
                        <p>The result of the conference was finally embodied in a memorandum, copy
                            of which I herewith transmit, (inclosure No. 2.) This memorandum will be
                            submitted to the council of state, whose views will be communicated to
                            us.</p>

                            <p>They (the Japanese ministers) understand that the foreign ministers
                                are dissatisfied with the measures taken by the Japanese government
                                relative to the native Christians.</p>
                            <p>Appreciating friendly intercourse and the respect of the treaty
                                powers for Japan, they have deemed it their duty to explain their
                                motives for these measures; that the inhabitants of the village of
                                Urakami are wrong in worshipping a foreign religion is not the
                                question, but as co-religionists they formed a party and thwarted
                                the authorities. The government would not treat those people
                                severely, simply because of their worship. The government never
                                inquire what religious opinions people inwardly profess, and <pb
                                    n="474" xml:id="pg_474" facs="0508"/>as long as they infringe no
                                laws or offer no resistance, though there may be many who profess
                                foreign religions, they will not be interfered with. And hence,
                                since the conclusion or treaties with foreign countries has the
                                government abolished the law of Fromi Se, (trampling on Christian
                                emblems,) which was established for the purpose of inspecting
                                people’s hearts.</p>
                            <p>The government have engaged in their schools to teach languages,
                                &amp;c., those who come here as missionaries, and have permitted any
                                one to translate and sell publicly all sorts of books, even such as
                                relate to religions. This proves that the government intends to
                                change the law respecting religion, but when the people commit
                                wrongs and misdemeanors, infringe the laws of the country, or resist
                                the power of the government on the plea of being Christians, or when
                                they are told by missionaries that they will not be punished, as
                                foreigners will protect them, then the government must step in, as
                                such things cannot be permitted. Advice must then be given to such
                                people, and they must be brought back to submission to the laws of
                                their country.</p>
                            <p>The government carries out the treaty in allowing foreigners to
                                worship their own religions, and build churches in Japan, but they
                                are dissatisfied with foreign priests who induce the people to
                                worship with them. They use soft speech and science, or give money
                                to those who worship their religion, telling them that foreigners
                                will aid them, and the people consequently become so outrageous as
                                to insult the authorities, and this must be remedied. On
                                investigation, it has invariably been found that these so-called
                                native Christians are only so in name; their acts, however, are such
                                as would undoubtedly be punished in all other countries. They
                                conceal among themselves all sorts of criminals, whom the government
                                wants to have arrested; they always disputed with others, and caused
                                disturbances; insulted our ancient religion, destroyed images of
                                gods, and defiled the gods from whom his Majesty the Mikado is
                                descended. If these people were left alone they would cause great
                                trouble, the government might be weakened, and the country
                                endangered. It would have been quite proper to punish these people
                                severely, but as it was promised in January, 1869, by Higashi Kwse
                                to the foreign ministers, that they would hereafter be treated
                                leniently, the government had no other means in dealing with this
                                matter than to remove those people to other places and thus cut off
                                their communication with priests, whose desires of converting them
                                may not be bad, but unfortunately the Japanese misapprehended the
                                matter and insulted the authorities. The government removed them in
                                the manner as promised to the foreign ministers. No severe treatment
                                was inflicted, but all necessary aid was rendered. This the
                                government prepared to prove.</p>
                            <p>The foregoing are the reasons which led to the measure that has been
                                taken. Between two and three hundred years ago the Roman Catholic
                                religion was propagated in Japan, and the government was then almost
                                brought to ruin in consequence, and the government has taken care
                                that this shall not happen again. If the governments of the powers
                                in amity with Japan should deem the measure to be an unfriendly one
                                to them the government of Japan would regret it very much.</p>
                            <p>The Japanese government are faithfully carrying out the treaty, both
                                for commercial and political purposes, and they expect aid from
                                foreign governments in this respect. They hope that the feeling of
                                the people against the Christian religion will die away one of these
                                days, and they feel assured that the governments of the treaty
                                powers agree with them that everything that injures the relation
                                between nations must be removed.</p>
                            <p>The Japanese government will not be obliged to resort to such
                                measures as the unpleasant one referred to, if foreign missionaries
                                would exclusively apply themselves to the teaching of their own
                                people according to the treaty, instead of acting improperly as
                                hitherto. Then the Japanese government may not be obliged to cut off
                                the communication of those of their people who seek information on
                                religious subjects with the missionaries, and may further have no
                                objection to send back to their village those who have been moved
                                out of it.</p>
                            <p>The Japanese government are desirous that their people be instructed
                                in arts and sciences, in which your country is superior, instead of
                                being instructed in religion, and they are, above all, desirous that
                                the existing friendship between our countries may increase more and
                                more.</p>

                            <p>The removal of the Christians was completed by the 8th of January,
                                and in the letter we wrote on the morning of the 9th, the words up
                                till yesterday occur. We could not know what would take place
                                afterward, the ships on which the Christians were embarked left the
                                port, but two of the steamers received some injury at sea, and this
                                together with other difficulties caused them to return to harbor.
                                The arrival of other vessels was awaited and to these the Christians
                                were transferred; some persons who had been absent in some other
                                place when their relatives were removed now came forward and begged
                                to be sent to the same place.</p>
                            <p>So many houses at Urakami being left vacant at the same time, it was
                                necessary, in order to prevent robberies, that officers should be
                                sent there, but as the search for the Christians had been already
                                completed there was no reason for any further search now that they
                                had been removed.</p>
                            <p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">Sentence</hi> 2.—<hi rend="italic"

                            <p>All of them were aware that the practice of Christianity is most
                                strictly prohibited, and that the offenders against this law are
                                liable to be severely punished. Therefore when they were informed
                                that in distributing them among the Hau families would not be
                                separated, and that the han had received instructions to provide
                                them with facilities for gaining a livelihood, they received the
                                announcement with gratitude, for they learned that so far from being
                                punished with the severity demanded by law, they were on the
                                contrary to be treated with the greatest consideration. As
                                natural-born subjects of Japan, they were bound to obey the Japanese
                                laws; what doubt therefore can there be that they appreciated the
                                indulgence with which they were treated on this occasion.</p>
                            <p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">Sentence</hi> 3.—<hi rend="italic"

                            <p>Every head of a family, without exception, received an allowance for
                                buying straw hoes. The sick were told that they might go into
                                hospital and receive treatment, <pb n="476" xml:id="pg_476"
                                    facs="0510"/>but most of them preferred to go abroad with the
                                others. In the same day one pregnant woman asked to accompany her
                                family, and she as well as the others were removed in accordance
                                with their own wishes. As the pregnant woman, just spoken of; seemed
                                close to her confinement, her case was a very pitiable one, and she
                                was recommended to stay behind and be attended to, but she persisted
                                in her desire to go on board ship with the rest, which was
                                accordingly done; she was certainly not urged by the officers to go
                                on board.</p>
                            <p>When the Christians were removed the officers went to Urakami on the
                                previous day and visiting all the houses in every village, where
                                large families lived, informed them in a kind way of the Emperor s
                                will; on the following morning they made their preparation for
                                embarking, and assembled at the house of their respective shoyal,
                                (head of village.) These persons were offended against a law of the
                                empire, and the Japanese practice is to summon such before the
                                proper officials and treat them like yetae, who are the lowest of
                                the people, but in the present case the officials have proceeded
                                themselves to their houses, and taken most exceptional measures in
                                regard to them. This will convince every one that no cruelty has
                                been practiced on them.</p>

                            <p>There were, also, some weak from old age, but they too were removed
                                in compliance with their own wish. In order that there might
                                afterward be proof that they were not compelled by the officials to
                                embark, they were caused to make their request in writing. As the
                                distance from Urakami to Nagasaki is but short, some who were
                                embarked from the latter place were carried on the backs of coolies,
                                but of those who were sent to Tokitsu for embarkation, some were
                                allowed kagi, (sedan chairs,) owing to the distance many of them
                                were accustomed to go barefoot, and the reason for not wearing straw
                                shoes was, because they preferred to go without.</p>

                            <p>The statements that families were divided, seems founded on false
                                reports. First of all, the heads of families in all the villages
                                were sent on board, and their destination determined. The families
                                were then distributed in such a way as to be sent to the same Hau as
                                the heads. Their number rendered it impossible to send the families
                                also in the same ship, but even though placed on board another ship,
                                this only made a difference of one or two days: and there is no
                                doubt but that in every case the members of each family arrived at
                                the same han. Those were, however, parents and children, brothers
                                and sisters, of the present emigrants, who were removed during last
                                year: but when an offer was made to them to send them to the same
                                han, the relations of persons who had gone to Choshü, with one
                                consent expressed their unwillingness to go there. The reason of
                                this was, that they had heard that the Christians who had been sent
                                to Choshü last year had, one after another, retracted their errors;
                                hence they earnestly begged to be sent to some other han, and in
                                some cases this request was granted. In their case it might be said
                                that families have been separated, but in no case have families been
                                separated by our act. If, through any mistake, separation had
                                occurred, much time would have been lost in ultimately sending the
                                separate families to the same place. The object was to send every
                                family to the same place; and as several ships were employed, and a
                                distribution made among the many different han, we were very anxious
                                lest there should be any confusion which might cause the separation
                                of families, and all the officials from the chikenji downward went
                                to Urakami and to the landing stairs, and attended to all the
                                proceedings until they were embarked on board ship. All suspicion
                                will be removed if the true account of these facts is inquired from
                                the people of Nagasaki.</p>

                            <p>No such thing as arresting the Christians and bringing them along in
                                custody really occurred. Their names were perfectly well known to
                                the authorities beforehand, and, as was said above, the officers
                                went to each house in all the villages and gave them notice. A
                                certain number of Christians were placed in charge of each officer,
                                who gave each of his party a yellow handkerchief, or some other
                                mark, by which they might be distinguished; and they were told that
                                when they came next day, having made their preparation, if they
                                brought with them the handkerchief or other token, they would avoid
                                becoming mixed up with people from other villages, and means would
                                be taken to transport not, only persons of the same family, but even
                                neighbors, to the same destination. They accordingly assembled at
                                the places named by the officials, and at the time appointed,
                                bringing with them the handkerchief or other token, in the intention
                                of all going on board at the same time. It may be remarked, that
                                even before being ordered by the officials to bring this token, some
                                had already provided themselves with white cotton handkerchiefs as
                                tokens to distinguish them. Those were certainly not <pb n="477"
                                    xml:id="pg_477" facs="0511"/>given by the officers in order to
                                distinguish the Christians from the heathen sect. We have, however,
                                not been able to discover that there is any sect in Japan
                                denominated “heathen.”</p>

                            <p>The families of the Christians were informed beforehand that they
                                might bring with them their clothes and other articles for present
                                use. Consequently some of them carried bundles and others put on
                                several suits of clothes; some of the poorer classes had not any
                                clothes, and money was lent them for their purchase, their farming
                                implements being deposited with the shoja as security. The property
                                which was left behind, consisting of horses, cattle, poultry, and
                                vegetables, was sold by public auction. The proceeds were deposited
                                with the authorities. Their household property was placed under
                                seal, and their houses shut up. Military was placed over them by
                                night and day to guard against fire and robbery, and effectual
                                precautions were taken against their loss. Some time was necessary
                                before all the property left behind in the houses of the different
                                villages could be collected.</p>

                            <p>On the day that the heads of villages were first of all sent on board
                                ship, it was stormy with snow, and as they suffered a great deal
                                from the cold the authorities provided them with sake and rice; if
                                inquiries are made from the merchants who sold the sake, and from
                                the messenger who fetched the sake and rice, the truth of this will
                                be plainly shown. Again, when the families were about to be sent on
                                board ship, as night had fallen and anxiety was felt lest the
                                confusion should cause families to be separated, we were obliged to
                                put them up for the night in public storehouses near the landing
                                stairs. On this occasion, the night venders of eatables were
                                admitted within the inclosure and the Christians were allowed to
                                purchase whatever they chose. As most of them were women and
                                children, no sake was provided by the authorities, but no
                                half-boiled rice was served out to them; on this occasion clerks
                                from the accountant’s department were present and superintended the
                                distribution of the rice. Both the officers detailed for this duty
                                and the Christians ate the same rice, and the food of both was
                                identical.</p>

                                given both to the guards sent from the Nagasaki kia, and to those
                                officials of Hau, who were to receive them, and certainly nothing
                                improper has taken place.</p>

                            <p>Strict injunctions were given beforehand to the Hau, by government,
                                to employ the Christians upon their arrival in their general
                                avocation, to allow them personal freedom, and by instructions to
                                make them loyal subjects, so that there is no reason to doubt that
                                after their arrival at their destination they enjoyed repose.</p>
                            <p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">Concluding sentences.—Reply.</hi></p>
                            <p>If the Christians had been violently siezed and brought along, it
                                would have been easy to employ the services of police officers to
                                make them embark; so far from this being done, high officers went
                                about in every direction and informed them what was to be done. Not
                                one person was arrested by the authorities; on the contrary, they
                                came of their own accord.</p>
                            <p>First of all, on the 1st of January, 1870, the heads of families all
                                received notice from the authorities to come at 9 o’clock the next
                                morning, but of those summoned only a few presented themselves.</p>
                            <p>The uniform practice in Japan has always been to punish all who, when
                                summoned, refuse to come, and even those who appear later than the
                                time indicated to them. In this case, however, special measures were
                                taken, and on the night of that day officers went to Urakami and
                                summoned the Christians together to the shoya. They were then asked
                                why they had not obeyed the commands of the authorities, when they
                                made all sorts of excuses, and pleaded urgently for a delay of two
                                or three days. The officers saw that the Christians, expecting to be
                                sent to other provinces like those who were removed last year,
                                wanted a delay of three days for collecting their household
                                property, and granted their request, as their families were not
                                removed until afterward. They made use of the interval to arrange
                                with their friends in the villages to make some sort of disposal of
                                their property.</p>
                            <p>It was in the above way that things were managed, and no resort
                                whatever was made to. military force. What forcible reason could
                                there have been for them to run <pb n="478" xml:id="pg_478"
                                    facs="0512"/>away and hide in the hills? The officers who were
                                to accompany them to the various hau took charge each of his own
                                party at Urakami, and accompanied them on board. Many houses were
                                left uninhabited, but patrols were dispatched thither to prevent
                                evil-disposed persons from other places from coming and doing
                                mischief. The escort of the Christians, unlike officers with other
                                criminals in their custody, were unprovided with fire-arms, and this
                                is a proof that military force was not resorted to. The Christians
                                appear to have conjectured that when they were summoned on the 1st
                                of January, it was for the purpose of being removed to some other
                                province, for about thirty persons ran away. The reason for this was
                                that there were among the Christians badly-behaved men who had
                                brought their household to ruin, and neglected the tilling of their
                                farms, preferring to make a living by giving religious instructions
                                to old women and young girls. Those men know that if this measure of
                                the government were carried out their means of livelihood would be
                                at an end, and so they spread reports of cruel treatment by the
                                authorities, and created distrust in the minds of the people. This
                                induced some to take flight from fear.</p>
                            <p>The passage in which it is said that the people of Nagasaki pitied
                                all the Christians, must mean that those who happened to see them
                                walking along the muddy road pitied them, not remembering that they
                                were accustomed to it, and did not much mind it The weather was
                                unfortunately cold and rainy, and the road was in a bad state. The
                                officers themselves pitied them, because the weather was so bad.
                                This, however cannot be attributed to the cruelty of the
                                government.</p>
                            <p>Since the foundation of the Japanese empire it has been the national
                                custom for high. or low to venerate, as the ancestors of our
                                Emperor, the god worshipped by them, and the people who show no
                                honor or veneration for the deities who were the parents of our
                                race, no matter how industrious in their occupations they may be,
                                commit a grave breach of the law by which the entire nation is
                                ruled. How can these persons be called civilized, no matter how
                                great an eagerness they may profess to learn (teach) European
                                civilization, if the only result of their efforts is to produce
                                national dissensions?</p>

                            cruel or uncalled for, do not seem to have been done in violation of any
                            treaty or agreement between Japan and the United States. They rather
                            appear to have been done in the exercise of the internal authority which
                            that government claims to possess over its subjects.</p>
                        <p>Until the views of the other treaty powers can be ascertained, the
                            Department can give you no other instructions than to continue to act in
                            the same spirit whenever occasion shall call for your interference.</p>
                        <p>Instructions have been sent to the ministers at London, Paris, and
                            Berlin, to ascertain whether those governments, respectively,
                            contemplate sending any further instructions on the subject to their
                            diplomatic or consular officers. When the replies are received to these
                            instructions, it is possible that the Department may communicate with
                            you further touching the matter.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> Information has been received from the
                            minister to Japan that the authorities of that empire have engaged in a
                            systematic persecution of the native Christians. It appears that these
                            converts to Christianity were residing at Urakami, a settlement at the
                            head of Nagasaki Bay, where they were peacefully and prosperously
                            pursuing their avocations, giving obedience to the temporal
                            authorities.</p>
                        <p>The late revolution in Japan, however, brought into power the Mikado,
                            whose partisans claim for him ecclesiastical and spiritual, as well as
                            temporal, power.</p>
                        <p>Because the native Christians could not conscientiously comply with the
                            established ordinances and observances, which they regarded as
                            idolatrous, it was determined to transport them from peaceful homes, to
                            seize upon their properties and to distribute them and their families
                            through the different parts of the Japanese empire.</p>
                        <p>The representatives of the treaty powers, hearing of this meditated
                            cruelty, took prompt measures to prevent it, if possible, by energetic
                            protests. The Japanese authorities met their protests by evasion; and
                            while holding the conferences with the European ministers, transported
                            their Christian subjects to the number, of about three thousand; and
                            when at a subsequent interview the reasons for this course were
                            demanded, they replied: “We do not remove this people on account of
                            their professions of the Christian faith, but on account of their
                            actions; and this government would have pursued the same course with any
                            other people; and unless we do this we don’t know how we will govern
                            them.”</p>
                        <p>The protocols of these conferences have been transmitted to Washington by
                            Mr. De Long, and doubtless have been communicated to the cabinet of
                            London.</p>
                        <p>The course of Mr. De Long, in taking part in these conferences, has been
                            entirely and cordially approved by the President, and he has been
                            instructed to continue to make representations to the Japanese
                            government in the same spirit, when occasion requires.</p>
                        <p>It is apparent, however, that the transportation of these persons is
                            inspired by the old traditional dislike of foreigners. The government of
                            the Mikado represents that political element. It is possible that, of
                            itself, it would not originate such measures, but it is weak, and the
                            country is in a state of political excitement that borders upon anarchy
                            and revolution.</p>
                        <p>The government of the Tycoon, that was disposed to cultivate intercourse
                            with the western nations, fell perhaps mainly from that cause. The
                            daimios that supported it have been reduced to submission by fire and
                            sword. The currency of the country is disorganized. Metals have
                            disappeared and a poor paper currency has taken their place, under the
                            influence of which business is affected, and discontent exists. Perhaps
                            it is too much to say that the liberal policy which has prevailed for
                            several years is in absolute danger, but there is certainly ground for
                            apprehension lest in such a political condition, and under the influence
                            of sudden popular pressure, a weak government may be forced to sanction,
                            or at least be unable to prevent, violent measures against the
                            foreigners residing in the empire.</p>
                        <pb n="480" xml:id="pg_480" facs="0514"/>
                        <p>It has seemed to the President that under these circumstances it will be
                            well, before further instructions are sent to the diplomatic and
                            consular officers of the United States in Japan, and to the naval
                            officers in the Asiatic squadron, to ascertain what the cabinets of
                            London, Paris, and Berlin propose to do in the premises, in order that
                            should there be an apparent unity of purpose in Europe, the policy of
                            the United States may be made to conform to it so far as our interests
                            will allow.</p>
                        <p>You will, therefore, inquire whether the facts relating to the
                            deportation of the native Christians have been reported to the
                            government of Great Britain; if they have been reported, whether it is
                            proposed to make them the subject of any instructions, and in that case
                            what are the nature and purport of those instructions. You will also
                            inquire whether the cabinet of London contemplates giving any new
                            instructions, or taking any new steps, to secure the safety of
                            foreigners residing in Japan, the better protection of the interests of
                            its subjects there, and the maintenance of the policy inaugurated by the
                            government of the Tycoon.</p>

                                attention to the facts as communicated to me by Mr. Fish.</p>

                            <p>It appears that these converts to Christianity wore residing at
                                Urakami, a settlement at the head of Nagasaki Bay, where they were

                                obedience to the temporal authorities.</p>
                            <p>The late revolution in Japan, however, brought into power the Mikado,
                                whose partisans claimed for him ecclesiastical and spiritual, as
                                well as temporal, power.</p>
                            <p>Because the native Christians could not consistently comply with the
                                established ordinances and observances which they regarded as
                                idolatrous, it was determined to transport them from peaceful homes,

                                cruelty, took prompt measures te prevent it, if possible, by
                                energetic protests. The Japanese authorities met their protests by
                                evasions, and while holding the conferences with the European
                                ministers, transported their Christian subjects, to the number of
                                about three thousand, and when at a subsequent interview the reasons
                                for this course were demanded, they replied, “We do not remove this
                                people on account of their professions of the Christian faith, but
                                on account of their actions, and this government would have pursued
                                the same course with any other people, and unless we do this we
                                don’t know how we will govern them.”</p>
                            <p>The protocols of these conferences have been transmitted to
                                Washington by the United States minister, Mr. De Long, and doubtless
                                have been communicated by the British minister in Japan to your
                                lordship.</p>
                            <p>The course of Mr. De Long in taking part in these conferences has
                                been entirely and cordially approved by the President, and he has
                                been instructed to make representations to the Japanese government
                                in the same spirit, when occasion requires.</p>
                            <p>It has seemed to the President that under these circumstances it will
                                be well, before further instructions are sent to the diplomatic and
                                consular officers of the United States in Japan and to the naval
                                officers in the Asiatic squadron, to ascertain what the cabinets of
                                London, Paris, and Berlin propose to do in the premises, in order
                                that should there be an apparent unity of purpose in Europe, the
                                policy of the United States may be made to conform to it so far as
                                their interests will allow.</p>
                            <p>I have accordingly the honor respectfully to inquire of your lordship
                                whether the facts relating to the deportation of the native
                                Christians have been reported to the government of Great Britain; if
                                they have been reported, whether it is proposed to make them the
                                subject of any instructions, and in that case what is the nature and
                                purport of those instructions.</p>
                            <p>I am also further directed respectfully to ask whether her Majesty s
                                government contemplates giving any new instructions or taking any
                                new steps to secure the safety of foreigners residing in Japan, the
                                better protection of the interests of its subjects there, or the
                                maintenance of the policy inaugurated by the government of the
                                Mikado.</p>
                            <p>I pray your lordship, &amp;c.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                                receipt of your letter of the 21st instant, recapitulating the
                                circumstances attending the dispersion, by order of the Japanese
                                government, of the colony of native Christians at Urakami, and
                                requesting to be informed whether these circumstances had been
                                reported to her Majesty’s government; and if so, whether they
                                proposed to make them the subject of any instructions; and, in that
                                case, what would be the nature and prospect of those
                                instructions.</p>
                            <p>I must request you, in the first place, to convey to the government
                                of the United States the thanks of her Majesty’s government for the
                                friendly spirit by which your communication has been dictated, and
                                to assure them that her Majesty’s government will always be glad to
                                find themselves in a position to coöperate with them as far as
                                possible in matters in regard to which, as in the present case, the
                                two governments have a common interest; and I think I cannot better
                                enable you to explain to your government the views of her Majesty’s
                                government than by placing you in possession of the inclosed copy of
                                the instruction which I addressed, on the 20th of April, to her
                                Majesty’s minister in Japan, on these matters. This instruction,
                                coupled with the dispatches to her Majesty’s ambassador at Paris, of
                                which I also inclose copies and extract, set forth so fully the
                                policy which her Majesty’s government think should be pursued in
                                regard to the case of the Christians in Japan, that I have but
                                little to add to their contents; although I would call your
                                attention to the letters of the late French minister in Japan, of
                                which copies are inclosed in my dispatch to Lord Lyons of the 23d of
                                May.</p>
                            <p>You will gather from all these papers, that her Majesty’s government,
                                although desiring to use their influence on all occasions in favor
                                of the native Christians in Japan, <pb n="482" xml:id="pg_482"
                                    facs="0516"/>would not think it advisable to put upon the Mikado
                                such an amount of pressure as might, it successful, serve to imperil
                                his position with his subjects in general The sovereign of Japan, in
                                his endeavor to reconcile his subjects to institutions in accordance
                                with the principles of Christian nations, has many difficulties to
                                contend with and it would be unwise to add to these difficulties, by
                                urging him abruptly to set at defiance the religious prejudices of
                                his people. It is the opinion of her Majesty’s minister in Japan,
                                that by dealing with the Mikado and his government for a time in a
                                spirit of forbearance, they will be enabled to regulate or overcome
                                the prejudices of the Japanese against Christians; and the more
                                readily if the latter show by their general conduct that their
                                profession of Christianity does not imply a renunciation of their
                                subjection to their national authorities, and the substitution of a
                                foreign foe for native allegiance. Her Majesty’s government learned,
                                with much satisfaction, from her Majesty’s minister at Washington in
                                a dispatch dated the 18th of April last, that Mr. Fish had expressed
                                himself entirely opposed on grounds both of principle and expediency
                                to the employment of force in behalf of the Christian converts in
                                Japan, stating that the government of the United States would
                                confine, themselves to addressing strong remonstrances on the
                                subject to the Japanese government. The views of our two governments
                                do not, therefore, present much difference; and the instructions
                                addressed to Sir Harry Parkes, on the 20th of April, will, it is
                                hoped, enable him to act in concert with the minister of the United
                                States.</p>
                            <p>With reference to the concluding passage in your letter, I have the
                                honor to state to you that her Majesty’s government does not at
                                present contemplate giving any new instructions or taking any new
                                steps for the safety of the persons or properties of British
                                subjects in Japan, or for the maintenance of the policy inaugurated
                                by the Mikado. They repose full reliance in the judgment and
                                discretion of her Majesty’s representative, and are well assured
                                that he will neglect no means for securing those ends, to which he
                                is well aware her Majesty’s government attach the greatest
                                importance.</p>
                            <p>I have the honor to be, with the highest consideration, sir, your
                                most obedient servant.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have received your dispatch No. 35
                                of the 26th of February, reporting your further communication with
                                the Japanese government respecting the recent deportation of native
                                Christians.</p>
                            <p>Her Majesty’s government entirely approve the course that you have
                                taken in regard to that transaction, and you will continue to point
                                out to the Japanese government the interest felt by all Christian
                                nations in the fate of those converts who appear to be orderly and
                                generally well-conducted persons, and to have committed no offense
                                such would justify their arbitrary removal from their homes. But you
                                will say further that although the Japanese government may have
                                thought that measure expedient, her Majesty s government trust that
                                it will redeem the promises that it has given to the foreign
                                minister, and take effectual measures for securing from further
                                persecution on account of their religious tenets the dispersed
                                members of the Christian community.</p>
                            <p>It appears to her Majesty’s government that the representatives of
                                foreign powers should fully avail themselves while scrupulously
                                abstaining from giving their proceedings an offensive appearance in
                                the eyes of the Japanese government and people of the offer made by
                                the minister to allow free access to the localities, among which the
                                Christians are distributed, and should take advantage of the
                                opportunity thus afforded to them for impressing upon the daimios,
                                to whose territories the Christians may have been removed severally,
                                to treat their new dependents well and to abstain themselves from
                                any further persecutions of them, and discountenance any such
                                proceedings on the part of others.</p>
                            <p>On the other hand it appears to her Majesty’s government that the
                                representatives, and more especially the French minister, from the
                                influence which he can bring to bear on the Roman Catholic
                                missionaries, might render most important service not only to the
                                Christian converts but to the cause of Christianity in general by
                                impressing on the converts the necessity of not setting themselves
                                up on the strength of their conversion in opposition to the law of
                                the empire. The converts, few in number and therefore weak should
                                seek to reconcile their rulers to themselves by showing that the
                                profession of the Christian religion is not incompatible with their
                                duties as good subjects. Political no less than religious
                                considerations may have influenced the government in its dealings
                                with the Christian converts, and when it is made to appear that it
                                need have no anxiety on the former grounds, it may very possibly be
                                less inclined to trouble itself with the latter.</p>

                                Christian persecution in Japan, and also a copy of a dispatch which.
                                I have addressed to him in reply.</p>

                                dispatch to the French minister for foreign affairs, and give him if

                                been taken against native converts and that the Roman Catholic
                                missionaries have not themselves been molested; and however much the
                                deportation of the converts from their homes and their dispersion
                                throughout Japan may be a measure of harshness as regards the
                                immediate victims, there is certainly no small amount of truth in
                                the observation made to Sir H. Parkes by one of the Japanese
                                ministers, that the distribution of the converts in nineteen
                                different localities is more calculated to facilitate the
                                propagation of Christianity throughout Japan than their unmolested
                                residence in the locality in which they have heretofore been
                                permitted to reside.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Lord:</hi> A few days ago during my absence
                                from indisposition, Monsieur Tirrot, first secretary of the French
                                embassy, called on Mr. Hammond by direction of the Marquis de la
                                Valette, to talk over, in consequence of instructions from his
                                government, the question of Christian persecution in Japan, and to
                                ascertain whether or how far her Majesty’s government were disposed
                                to act in concert with that of France in regard to that matter.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Hammond said in reply to Monsieur Tirrot’s inquiry that of course
                                it was not for him to give an official answer to it, but that he had
                                no hesitation in saying that he was sure her Majesty’s government
                                would not be disposed to do more than had already been done by her
                                Majesty’s minister in Japan.</p>
                            <p>It appeared, indeed, Mr. Hammond said, that far from deprecating the
                                dispersion of the native Christian colonists at Urakami, the Roman
                                Catholic missionaries in Japan, and indeed all persons who were
                                interested in the propagation of the gospel in that country, ought
                                to see with satisfaction 19 Christian stations scattered by the act
                                of the Japanese government throughout the country, rather than that
                                the Christian converts should be confined as heretofore to a single
                                locality; and that the measure had been viewed in that light by a
                                native person high in office in Japan, who had made the observation
                                to Sir II. Parkes. Moreover, the Japanese government did not seem to
                                wish to couple the dispersion of the Christians with any other
                                hardships to be inflicted on them, for they were ready to allow them
                                to be united in the new localities to which they were removed by the
                                representatives of the Christian powers, who would there have the
                                means of satisfying themselves that they were otherwise not ill
                                treated. But after all, some allowance must be made for the Japanese
                                government, who had, on their side also, to consult the religious
                                opinions and scruples of their own people; and instead of pressing
                                the government too hard, the Christian powers ought to deal
                                forbearingly with them and accept what the Japanese government were
                                willing to concede, trusting that more might be obtained
                                hereafter.</p>
                            <p>This, Mr. Hammond said, was the view taken of the matter by Sir H.
                                Parkes, who advocated moderation in dealing with the Japanese
                                government in this matter, and who was of opinion that the question
                                of Christianity, if left alone, would sooner or later arrive at a
                                satisfactory solution. Railways and telegraphs, Sir H. Parkes
                                thought, would soon make a change in the Japanese mind; and he could
                                not but hope that, as regards Christianity, there would gradually be
                                a marked improvement in the feeling and conduct of the government as
                                well as of the people of Japan.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Hammond said that he was satisfied that the policy recommended by
                                Sir H. Parkes was in accordance with the views of her Majesty’s
                                government and of the British Parliament and people, and he felt
                                satisfied they were not prepared to depart from it.</p>
                            <p>Monsieur Tirrot alluded to a memorandum, which, how ever, bore no
                                date, which the representatives of the Christian powers had recently
                                delivered to the Japanese government, and in which they offered to
                                exert their influence to keep missionaries within bounds, provided
                                that the dispersed converts were permitted to return to their former
                                homes. But it did not appear what result had attended this offer.
                                Her Majesty’s government have not yet received a copy of this paper
                                from Sir H. Parkes.</p>
                            <pb n="484" xml:id="pg_484" facs="0518"/>
                            <p>Mr. Hammond was careful to explain to Monsieur Tirrot that everything
                                he had said in this conversation must be taken only as the
                                expression of his own personal opinions; he had no objection, he
                                said, to Monsieur Tirrot repeating it, as such, to his government;
                                and having secured from Mr. Hammond an account of the language which
                                he held to Monsieur Tirrot, I think it right to make your excellency
                                also acquainted with it, and to inform you that her Majesty’s
                                government entirely concur in it.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Lord:</hi> With reference to my dispatch No.
                                351, of the 2d instant, and. to previous correspondence respecting
                                religious persecution in Japan, I now transmit to your excellency a
                                further dispatch, and its inclosures, which I have received from Sir
                                H. Parkes on this subject, and reporting what had passed at an
                                interview which he had with the foreign minister and vice-minister
                                respecting the question of the return of the native converts to
                                Urakami. At this interview, as your excellency will see, special
                                reference was made by the Japanese authorities to the correspondence
                                which passed in 1867 between the French minister, M. Roches, and the
                                Tycoon’s government, at which period an assurance was given by the
                                former that propagandism on the part of the Roman Catholic
                                missionaries should be strictly interdicted. The Japanese minister
                                now again reverts to this argument and urges that the instructions
                                issued by M. Roches in 1867 to the French consul at Nagasaki and to
                                the French bishop should be adhered to, and that the French
                                missionaries should be enjoined not to visit Urakami for missionary
                                purposes and not to encourage the Japanese in offering any
                                opposition to their own laws or authorities. M. Roches’s
                                instructions, above referred to, were communicated to your
                                excellency at the time, but as you may have not retained copies of
                                them, they are herewith annexed. Her Majesty’s government concur in
                                the prudence of the instruction then issued by M. Roches, and are of
                                opinion that the Japanese government have a fair claim to ask that
                                they should be acted upon; and if the French government adopt M.
                                Roches’s views and instructions there is every reason to believe
                                that the differences which have arisen out of the late proceedings
                                of Roman Catholic missionaries in Japan will be brought to a
                                close.</p>
                            <p>I spoke in this sense two days ago to Mr. Tirrot, when he renewed
                                with me the question of Christian persecution in Japan with
                                reference to a communication received by the French government from
                                that of the United States, which seemed disposed to condemn the
                                conduct of the authorities in Japan.</p>

                            <p>Thus, no priest of the apostolic mission must henceforth go to
                                Urakami, or elsewhere, for purposes of religious propagandism; for,
                                during the great state of excitement which now prevails in the south
                                of Japan, the presence of a Catholic missionary in the midst of the
                                Japanese population would be sure to cause incalculable evils, where
                                a sound policy and the true interest of our religion admonish us to
                                make every effort to avoid such a result.</p>

                                good faith of the government of the Tycoon is that he consents to
                                set his subjects at liberty without imposing upon them the formula
                                of pardon required under such circumstances, and which might seem
                                like an abjuration. Now, this pardon, granted unconditionally to
                                persons guilty, according to the laws of Japan, is without any
                                precedent.</p>
                            <p>But I must add that if the Tycoon pardons the past, he understands
                                that, in future, the Japanese are to respect the laws of the empire.
                                I hope, therefore, monseigneur, that, as regards our apostolic
                                mission, you will avoid any act which might be calculated to uphold
                                Japanese subjects who profess the Christian religion in the way of
                                resistance which they have entered toward the authorities to which
                                they are subject according to Japanese law.</p>
                            <p>This resistance, monseigneur, would, no doubt, again cause a severe
                                repression, which the present state of affairs in Japan would
                                prevent me from moderating, and you, a minister of peace and
                                gentleness, would assume the responsibility of the troubles and
                                misfortunes which would be the inevitable consequence thereof.</p>

                                    apostolic vicar in Japan</persName>.</head>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Monseigneur:</hi> You will to-day receive an
                                official letter, an authentic copy of which I have transmitted to
                                the Japanese government. It was only in consequence of the delivery
                                of this document to it that it consented to set the Japanese
                                prisoners at liberty without imposing any act upon them which might
                                be regarded as an abjuration.</p>
                            <p>It was, moreover, certainly not without great difficulties that I
                                reached this solution. The daimios, who, we had been told, were
                                favorable to the spreading of Christianity, and who were perfectly
                                well informed concerning everything that was going on at Urakami,
                                have all sent protests to the Tycoon against this state of things.
                                They have allowed it to be supposed that the government of the
                                Tycoon tacitly assented thereto, and they have declared that they
                                were determined to resort to the most energetic means in order to
                                cause the fundamental law of Japan to be respected, and they declare
                                that they have given the most stringent orders for the beheading of
                                any European priest or of any Japanese Christian who may dare to
                                enter their territory.</p>
                            <p>These letters of the daimios are not by any means an argument
                                invented by the Japanese government to cover the necessity of the
                                case. <hi rend="italic">I have read them and have hem able to verify
                                    their authenticity.</hi></p>
                            <p>You will at once comprehend, monseigneur, how difficult is the
                                position of the Tycoon, who is deputed by the Mikado to enforce the
                                laws of the empire. This young prince is actuated by the most
                                liberal views; he understands that the day is not far distant when
                                laws of religious toleration must replace the laws of barbarous
                                fanaticism which are still in force, but, on the other hand, he is
                                too well acquainted with his country and the spirit of its
                                aristocracy to compromise the future by a premature and unsuitable
                                measure.</p>
                            <p>This, then, is the situation, monseigneur. Is not the clemency of the
                                sovereign, who is not yet sufficiently strong to control the
                                fanaticism of his daimios, a sound guarantee for the future? Should
                                we not be grateful to him for a decision without precedent in the
                                history of Japan, and avoid placing new difficulties in the path,
                                already full of obstacles, which he has entered with so much
                                resolution?</p>
                            <p>One year and ten years are not appreciable delays in the
                                accomplishment of the designs of God. You know this better than I,
                                monseigneur; do not, therefore, let it be supposed that you are
                                disposed to compromise the work of your successors by the desire,
                                otherwise very noble, of finishing it yourself.</p>
                            <p>Very great self-denial is required of you, it is true, but you will
                                make this sacrifice, for, I say it in the sincerity of my heart, you
                                possess all the virtues of the apostolate.</p>
                            <p>I ask you to suspend action, monseigneur. I transmit, by mail, to the
                                government of the Emperor all the documents and information which
                                can enlighten it on this important question. Let us await its
                                decision. It will, without doubt, be calculated to satisfy the
                                requirements of religion and of policy.</p>

                            in the sessions of the 28th and 29th ultimo, in opposition to the

                            This orator is perhaps the most strenuous defender of that measure, and,
                            as will be seen by his speech, bases his argument, in a great degree,
                            upon the well-known opposition of the Government of the United States.
                            He also intimates that the American Government attempted to influence
                            himself and another deputy to report against the Free Zone, when serving
                            upon a committee of consultation a year or two since.</p>

                                me an undivided attention during the exposition, which I will
                                endeavor to make as brief as possible.</p>
                            <p>At the outset, I must state that I have seen, with regret, as well in
                                the session of yesterday as in that of to-day, that the supporters
                                of the Free Zone have seen fit to bring into the discussion the
                                desires or the convenience of a foreign nation in reference to this
                                subject. It seems to me unworthy of this hall, and almost indecorous
                                for Congress, that in treating a question essentially Mexican, there
                                should be presented, as a consideration which ought to have a
                                decisive influence on its judgment, such desires or such convenience
                                of a foreign nation, especially when these reasons, which so much
                                affect the notorious patriotism and lively susceptibility of
                                Congress, with the object of preventing a maturer consideration, and
                                causing it to decide this question rather with the heart than with
                                the head.</p>
                            <p>At the time of the discussion of the Free Zone last year, when the
                                bases of the tariff were approved, it was insinuated, with more or
                                less directness, as it has been more sparingly during the present
                                debate, that the executive opinion against the Free Zone emanated
                                from a fear of the neighboring nation, which had expressed a wish to
                                have that zone abolished, or from an excessive condescension toward
                                that nation. Those who believe this, know neither the character of
                                the present incumbent of the executive chair nor the tendencies of
                                the human heart. To proceed in. this manner it would be necessary
                                that the executive should renounce the fulfillment of his most
                                sacred duties, and abdicate every sentiment of patriotism, and even
                                every sentiment of personal dignity. To sacrifice the interests of a
                                nation, the welfare and prosperity of a portion of its inhabitants,
                                the decorum and the dignity of the republic, to an excess of fear or
                                of servility, it would be necessary to have lost not merely every
                                patriotic sentiment but even the dignity of freemen. The chief of
                                the nation who was not intimidated when the whole colossal power of
                                France sought to subjugate the republic, is not the man who could be
                                intimidated because a friendly neighboring nation makes to him a
                                courteous and amicable suggestion. If the executive should carry the
                                fear or the servility which is imputed to him so far as to sacrifice
                                the interests of the nation to a foreign interest, as surely as he
                                would be contemned within the republic, he would be despised by the
                                very nation in whose behalf he had made such a sacrifice. The
                                practical knowledge which I have of the United States, from having
                                had the fortune to reside there eight years, makes me certain that
                                any Mexican functionary who, through servile deference toward that
                                nation, should sacrifice the legitimate interests of his own
                                country, would meet in that society only with scorn and contempt.
                                There is, perhaps, no nation which better knows how to appreciate
                                patriotism and the fulfillment of duty than the United States. With
                                this conviction, can any one believe, in good faith, that ignoble or
                                unpatriotic sentiments have guided the executive in determining his
                                opinion against the Free Zone? I refrain from enlarging upon these
                                considerations, because, as I have already said, it seems to me
                                inappropriate and improper to mingle with the discussion of this
                                subject the interests of a foreign nation. I believe that this
                                question ought to be decided in view of the interests of our own
                                country, and from this stand-point I propose to examine it, begging
                                the chamber to pardon me for having touched upon considerations of
                                another character, to which I have been forced by the allusions
                                which the orators who have advocated the Free Zone have thought
                                proper to make.</p>
                            <p>The question of the Free Zone is very complicated and ought to be
                                considered under its various aspects. Upon laying out a new dividing
                                line between Mexico and the United States, in accordance with the
                                treaty of February 2, 1848, one fact became unavoidably evident,
                                which had before been unknown, owing to the fact that the two
                                nations were separated by immense deserts. This fact was that the
                                United States enjoyed peace, security, guarantees for persons and
                                property, low tariffs, and commercial privileges; while in Mexico,
                                through a long chain of misfortunes known to all, almost all these
                                advantages were unknown, or were enjoyed in a much smaller degree
                                than in the United States. It was a natural consequence of these
                                difficulties of condition that all this welfare and prosperity on
                                one side should be converted into misery and decadence on the other,
                                aggravated by the presence at a very short distance, of the
                                advantages <pb n="488" xml:id="pg_488" facs="0522"/>enjoyed beyond
                                the Rio Bravo, (Grande.) Upon a philosophical and impartial
                                examination of the causes and the remedies of this state of affairs,
                                without any desire to prejudice the mind of the chamber by exciting
                                its patriotism, it is apparent that there was in all this two things
                                substantially different, though closely connected— the social or
                                political situation, and the mercantile situation. The causes of the
                                difference in the social or political situation were, on the one
                                hand, uncompromising obedience to law, a system of government
                                calculated to secure and develop the interests of the majority, and
                                other causes of no less importance, and, on the other hand, the
                                results of absolute systems of government, whose object was the
                                welfare of the few to the detriment of the many, the lack of peace,
                                of security, and of respect of law, and other circumstances of equal
                                importance. This inequality of condition could not consequently, be
                                remedied either by the establishment of the zone or by any other
                                artificial measure. Its remedy would require, on our part, peace,
                                respect for law, security, a system of government favorable to the
                                interests of the majority, and the other conditions which prevail in
                                the neighboring state. Fortunately we have now entered upon this
                                path, and if, as is to be hoped, we do not encounter in it any
                                insuperable obstacle, we shall, in time, succeed in rendering the
                                condition of the two banks of the Rio Bravo identical in political
                                and social well-being, but it is very evident that this result
                                cannot be obtained by means of the Free Zone.</p>
                            <p>The prevailing mercantile condition on the two banks of the Rio Bravo
                                prior to the year 1858, when the decree creating the Free Zone was
                                issued, was also different, being: undoubtedly more favorable for
                                the left than for the right bank. The principal causes of this
                                difference were three: 1st, on the American shore the privilege of
                                ports of deposit was enjoyed, which was wanting to the Mexican side;
                                2d, the tariffs were much lower in the United States than with us;
                                and 3d, the national productions of the United States, and foreign
                                goods after paying import duty, enjoyed the fullest liberty of
                                transit and sale throughout all the territory of the United States,
                                while in Mexico both native and foreign goods were subjected to all
                                the burdens and inconveniences of excises and of a severely
                                restrictive system.</p>
                            <p>By virtue of the privilege of ports of deposit the merchants of the
                                left bank of the Rio Bravo could import merchandise, store it in
                                bond until they found purchasers, sell condition that the buyers
                                should pay the duties, and enjoy all the other privileges afforded
                                by extensions of time and by ports of deposit. On the Mexican shore
                                there were none of these privileges. The Mexican merchant had to
                                pay, on importing his merchandise, the entire duties of the tariff,
                                much higher than those paid on the other side, and this alone
                                constituted a great inequality and gave a great superiority to the
                                residents on the left bank of the river.</p>
                            <p>The difference in the tariff on imported goods on both sides of the
                                river also gave a great advantage to the left bank. At that time the
                                Mexican tariffs were those of 1845 and 1853, the highest that have
                                ever prevailed in the republic, averaging from 30 to 40 per cent.,
                                while the American tariff barely averaged 15 per cent. The same
                                articles of national produce, such as flour, milk, &amp;e., cost a
                                half or two-thirds less on the left bank than on the right, because
                                in the former case it was free from all imposts, while in the latter
                                it had to bear all the exactions of the excise. If the merchandise
                                was of foreign production the difference in favor of the left bank
                                was a third or a fourth part. It was natural, then, that the
                                residents on the right bank of the river should have to supply
                                themselves, even with articles of the first necessity, from the left
                                bank. The extract from the recommendation made by Señor Esparza,
                                which was just read, merely states a notorious and undeniable
                                fact.</p>
                            <p>It is necessary to dwell upon the advantage which the settlers on the
                                left bank had over those of the right, in virtue of the freedom of
                                interior traffic which all the inhabitants of the United States then
                                enjoyed, while those of our country were subjected to the
                                innumerable exactions of the excise.</p>
                            <p>In virtue of this difference in circumstances it was natural and
                                necessary that the mercantile condition of the Mexican shore should
                                be far inferior to that of our neighbors. The law which established
                                the Free Zone was intended to equalize these circumstances by
                                conceding to the residents on our side equal privileges to those
                                which their neighbors enjoyed; but although this was the spirit the
                                letter went much further, since, instead of establishing ports of
                                deposit at the frontier settlements, it decreed an exemption from
                                the federal imposts to all the merchandise consumed in them, and
                                freedom of transit between them, although restricted by the
                                obligation to obtain documents from the custom-houses for that
                                purpose.</p>
                            <p>It is necessary to notice the great difference which exists between
                                the situation of the frontier at the time of the establishment of
                                the Free Zone and the situation it would now be in if that zone had
                                not been established. As has just been stated, there were in 1858
                                three very important circumstances which rendered the mercantile
                                situation of the right bank of the Bravo inferior to that of the
                                left bank. Of these circumstances one has entirely disappeared,
                                another partially, and the third would still exist if it were not
                                for the Free Zone. That which has entirely disappeared is the higher
                                duties collected on the Mexican side of the river. The annual
                                estimate of the <pb n="489" xml:id="pg_489" facs="0523"/>United
                                States Government until the year 1860, and before the war with the
                                South, was about forty-five millions of dollars per annum, and that
                                amount was obtained from the duties on imports.</p>
                            <p>To enable the custom-houses to yield that sum it was enough to
                                collect on foreign merchandise about 15 per cent. <hi rend="italic"
                                    >ad valorem</hi>. At the commencement of the southern war, in
                                1861, the estimate was considerably raised, and to carry on the war
                                they had to contract a debt, the annual interest on which is more
                                than a hundred millions of dollars. In the years following the war
                                the annual estimate was from three hundred and fifty to four hundred
                                millions, and of this sum the half was produced by customs duties,
                                and the other half by a series of imposts called “internal
                                revenue.”</p>
                            <p>It is easily understood that in order to enable the customs, which in
                                1858 yielded 45 millions, to produce 175 millions in 1867, it was
                                necessary to more than double the tariff. Instead of the 15 per
                                cent, of 1858, it amounted from 1862 to 40 or 50 per cent. As our
                                tariff is never higher than 25 to 30 per cent., there was a
                                difference in our favor of from 15 to 20 per cent., instead of a
                                similar difference against us up to 1858. Consequently foreign
                                merchandise, after paying the regular duties on either side of the
                                river, would now be worth from 15 to 20 per cent, less on the right
                                than on the left bank. The inequality against us has, then,
                                completely ceased and given place to an inequality in our favor.</p>
                            <p>The second cause of inferiority of condition on our side of the
                                river, and which has partially disappeared, is the excise. Although
                                the constitution wisely provided in its 124th article, that from and
                                after the 1st of June, 1858, excises and interior customhouses
                                throughout the republic shall be abolished, this provision has not,
                                unfortunately, been lawfully complied with, and although laudable
                                efforts have been made in many states to obey this precept, this
                                important improvement has failed to be realized in some of them.
                                Nevertheless, the abolition of the excise in the states adjoining
                                the frontier of Tamaulipas produces in favor of border commerce the
                                same result as if it had been abolished throughout the republic.</p>
                            <p>There would not remain, then, any further cause of inequality in the
                                mercantile condition of the two banks of the Bravo than that which
                                results from the existence of ports of deposit on the left bank, and
                                their absence on the right bank. This cause has been considerably
                                diminished by virtue of the American Executive having recently
                                closed most of the custom-houses along the river in front of
                                Tamaulipas.</p>
                            <p>But even if this were not so, and supposing this cause of inequality
                                to be still in existence in all its force, the most that could be
                                desired by the right bank of the river, in order not to consider
                                itself in an inferior position, would be the establishment of ports
                                of deposit upon that bank. As the idea of the executive in opposing
                                the Free Zone is not at all the desire that the inhabitants of our
                                frontier should be in a worse condition than that of their
                                neighbors, but, quite the contrary, to favor them as far as
                                possible, and make their condition equal or superior to that of
                                those neighbors, he would be willing, notwithstanding the opposition
                                he has manifested to the establishment of ports of deposit in all
                                the custom-houses of the republic, to favor a grant to the frontier
                                settlements of privileges similar to those of ports of deposit, by
                                which means all occasion for any inequality between the two banks of
                                the Bravo, in respect to commerce, would necessarily cease.</p>
                            <p>It is seen then that the Free Zone cannot equalize the social or
                                political condition of the two banks of the river which separates us
                                from the United States, and that in consequence of the changes since
                                the year 1861, and of those which will follow certain privileges
                                which may be conceded to the frontier settlements, their mercantile
                                situation would be equalized and even improved.</p>
                            <p>If in spite of such measures in consequence of greater security and
                                better guarantees for the stability of the government, which are
                                enjoyed on the other side of the Bravo, some of our countrymen
                                should emigrate thither, it is not in our power to prevent it, and I
                                think that we ought not to trouble ourselves very much on account of
                                persons who so far condemn their own nationality as to renounce it,
                                even after their mercantile condition has been rendered superior to
                                that of their neighbors.</p>
                            <p>When this subject was discussed a year ago, the orators who defended
                                the Free Zone made great efforts to demonstrate that it does not
                                constitute a privilege. Although at first sight it might be thought
                                that this is a mere question of words, it is not so in fact, and as
                                the constitution prohibits the granting of any privilege, it is
                                incontestible that the Free Zone being, as it is, a privilege, is
                                prohibited by our fundamental code.</p>
                            <p>There are those now who insist upon trying to demonstrate that the
                                Free Zone is not a privilege. This is almost an insult to common
                                sense, and one of the orators who has lately defended the Free Zone
                                did not fail to recognize it as such. We have also just seen that
                                the orator who, a year ago, endeavored to prove that the Free Zone
                                is not a privilege, considered and called it such a short time ago.
                                If the fact that a portion of the inhabitants of the republic may
                                consume foreign merchandise without paying duties to the federal
                                treasury, while all the other inhabitants, rich or poor, who consume
                                them, have to pay duties, is not a privilege, we must agree that
                                this word has no meaning.</p>
                            <pb n="490" xml:id="pg_490" facs="0524"/>
                            <p>After these general considerations upon the condition of the
                                frontier, and upon the objects and tendencies of the Free Zone, I
                                think it proper to make a rapid examination of the decree of March
                                17, 1858, which established it j for this decree, which is declared
                                by the article of the tariff bills we are now discussing to be in
                                full force, would hereafter have the same effect as if it had been
                                passed by the Congress of the Union, and its many inconveniences
                                could not be remedied except by another act of Congress. The
                                introduction to this decree shows that its object was to establish
                                an equality in the mercantile condition of the two banks of the Rio
                                Bravo, even though its effects might be to establish a real
                                superiority in favor of the right bank. The preamble is as
                                follows:</p>
                            <p>“Considering that the settlements upon the northern frontier are in a
                                state of real decline through the lack of laws to protect their
                                commerce; that being situated in front of a mercantile nation which
                                enjoys freedom in commerce, they need equal advantages in order not
                                to lose their inhabitants.”</p>
                            <p>It is evident, then, that the object was to give the frontier
                                settlements advantages equal to those enjoyed by the American towns.
                                This desire was legitimate, and the Mexican frontier settlements may
                                be thought to have a right to such advantages; but all that goes
                                beyond this would be to obtain privileges which were not absolutely
                                necessary for the well-being of those settlements, and which were a
                                real burden to the rest of the nation.</p>
                            <p>An incident which clearly shows the tendencies of the decree by which
                                the Free Zone was established, and which, in my opinion, would be
                                sufficient to deter Congress from blindly adopting this decree, is
                                to be found in its first article, and I think it my duty to call to
                                it the attention of Congress.</p>
                            <p>By all which it says in favor of the Free Zone, and in the
                                considerations which are found in the preamble of the decree, it
                                would appear that the exemptions conceded by it to the frontier
                                settlements were considered as having a vital importance, and that
                                the interests of the treasury and every other consideration should
                                be sacrificed to this object. This being the case, and when the
                                federal treasury was deprived of the duties which belonged to it on
                                the merchandise consumed in these settlements, it would have been
                                excedingly natural to renounce also the duties collected by the
                                state, which has an interest far greater than the federation in the
                                welfare and prosperity of that region. Was this, perchance, a
                                provision of the decree establishing the Free Zone? Those who now
                                listen to the defenders of that institution would suppose so; but
                                that is not what the decree provides. Its first article is as
                                follows:</p>
                            <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Article</hi> I. Foreign merchandise intended
                                for the consumption of the city of Matamoras, and the other towns
                                upon the bank of the Rio Bravo, Reinosa, Camargo, Mier, Guerrero,
                                and Monterey Laredo, and the reciprocal commerce of these towns,
                                shall be free from all imposts, except the municipal and those
                                collected to defray the expenses of the state.”</p>
                            <p>It is to be noted that the language of the decree scrupulously avoids
                                to give to the suppressed imposts their proper name, which would be
                                    <hi rend="italic">those</hi> belonging to the federal treasury.
                                True, the decree says that <hi rend="italic">all imposts</hi> are
                                suppressed, but in the same paragraph those which are not federal,
                                    <hi rend="italic">i.</hi>
                                <hi rend="italic">e</hi>., the municipal and state duties are
                                excepted.</p>
                            <p>Either the concessions of these exemptions is a vital question of <hi
                                    rend="italic">to be or not to be,</hi> to which every interest
                                of whatever kind shall be subordinated, and in this case it is
                                inexplicable that the State of Tamaulipas, which suppressed the
                                duties belonging to the federation, did not also abolish those of
                                the state, leaving in force only those of a municipal character; or
                                this interest is not so vital as has been represented, and in this
                                case there is no occasion to sacrifice to it the pecuniary interests
                                of the federation without any proportional sacrifice of the similar
                                interests of the state.</p>
                            <p>If, in fact, it is a necessity for the well-being of those
                                settlements that they should enjoy an absolute exemption from
                                duties, it would be illogical to grant this respecting the federal
                                duties alone, and not respecting those of the state; if an absolute
                                exemption is not indispensable, then the natural and convenient
                                course would be, that any reduction should be borne <hi
                                    rend="italic">pro rata</hi> by the federal and state treasuries.
                                And can a decree which contains these monstrosities be gravely
                                proposed for the sanction of Congress without the discussion and
                                examination of each one of these features?</p>
                            <p>Another inconvenience of the decree of the Free Zone is found in the
                                first part of article 4, as follows:</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">“Article</hi> IV. Effects which are dispatched
                                from towns where custom-houses exist, intended for free consumption,
                                shall take out passes in the same manner as is customary with the
                                interior traffic of the republic.”</p>
                            <p>As may be seen, this article proposes to give rules for the transit
                                of merchandise destined for free consumption, and the only one which
                                is laid down could not be more ambiguous or exposed to greater
                                inconveniences. It is provided that merchandise shall take out the
                                    <hi rend="italic">customary</hi> passes for the internal
                                commerce of the republic. What are these customary passes? Are they
                                such as were <hi rend="italic">then</hi> in force in Tamaulipas, or
                                such as have been established since? In the latter case the
                                federation would become subjected, in a matter of so much importance
                                as that of the internal traffic of the republic, to <pb n="491"

                                subject, or of designating especially the laws which are to be
                                considered in force, cannot be questioned.</p>
                            <p>Another grave inconvenience of the decree of March 17, 1858, is that
                                it does not fix with precision the extent of the Free Zone, since,
                                though in the first article it seems to limit it to the settlements
                                on the shore of the Rio Bravo, in the latter part of article 4 the
                                dimensions of the Zone are enlarged indefinitely. It concludes
                                thus:</p>
                            <p>“Effects destined for the consumption of the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >ranchos</hi> (hamlets) within the jurisdiction of these towns,
                                shall enjoy the benefit of exemption from duties when they do not
                                exceed the value of thirty dollars, and are provided with the
                                requisite passes, without which they will be confiscated.”</p>
                            <p>It is evident here that certain jurisdictions are spoken of, but not
                                geographically bounded, and may perchance be held to include the
                                whole State of Tamaulipas. It is also to be seen that the benefit of
                                an exemption from duties is conceded by this article not only to the
                                goods consumed in the towns along the right bank of the Bravo, but
                                also to the <hi rend="italic">ranchos</hi>, with an undetermined
                                jurisdiction, although with the limitation that their value shall
                                not exceed thirty dollars. It is easily to be understood that this
                                limitation would be a nullity, and would only serve to countenance
                                fraud.</p>
                            <p>Another indication that it was the intention of the author of the
                                Free Zone decree to include in it the whole State of Tamaulipas, or,
                                at least, all the northern district of that state, is that in
                                speaking of the payment of duties upon goods which are sent inland
                                for consumption in places not included in the Free Zone, he
                                invariably uses the phrase <hi rend="italic">to send into the
                                    interior of this republic,</hi> without foreseeing the case of
                                the goods being sent inland to other points of the State of
                                Tamaulipas.</p>
                            <p>The advocates of the Free Zone not only deny that contraband trade is
                                encouraged by it, but even assert that the Zone is the best, if not
                                the only, preventive of such traffic.</p>
                            <p>All the reasons which have been, or may be, alleged in defense of
                                this theory are, in my opinion, unfounded, and are satisfactorily
                                refuted by article 8 of the decree of March 17, 1858. The author of
                                this decree, who saw practically the decadence of the frontier
                                towns, its causes and the means of remedy, and who found a method
                                which, in the opinion of the advocates of the Zone, was highly
                                ingenious and worthy to be maintained and extended, is doubtless Pf
                                better authority on this point than the present defenders of the
                                Zone.</p>
                            <p>Very well, the author of the said decree believed that the
                                establishment of the Zone would foment contraband trade to such a
                                degree that he thought it necessary to consign in an article of his
                                decree an especial recommendation to the inhabitants of the frontier
                                that, in his own words, the benefit conferred upon them should not
                                be converted <hi rend="italic">into a shameful contraband
                                    trade.</hi></p>
                            <p>The eighth article of the decree is literally as follows:</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">“Article</hi> VIII. As the exemption granted by
                                this decree ought not to prejudice the national revenues, the
                                inhabitants of the frontier are under an obligation to prevent, by
                                all means within their power, this benefit which is granted to them
                                from <hi rend="italic">becoming a shameful contraband trade</hi>,
                                and consequently every inhabitant of the frontier ought
                                spontaneously to become a common sentinel and enemy of everything
                                contraband; if this is not done, the government will be placed under
                                the stem necessity to take away this exemption by revoking the
                                present decree.”</p>
                            <p>Besides this opinion, which has much weight with me, the facts are in
                                favor of its correctness. As the executive desired to proceed with
                                all possible accuracy in the important question of the tariff, it
                                circulated to all the custom-houses of the sea-coast, asking an
                                opinion thereon, the tariff which was presented to the chamber more
                                than a year since by its own committee. In this way it obtained a
                                mass of information which it used in drawing up the observations
                                which it made upon the projected tariff which the chamber afterward
                                provisionally approved. The opinion of the customs authorities of
                                Tampico is found in a communication dated November 21, 1869, in
                                which the collector of that port, an officer of great experience,
                                when speaking of the causes which facilitated contraband trade, said
                                of the Free Zone the following, which I will take the liberty to
                                read to Congress:</p>
                            <p>“The possibility of this clandestine trade is proved by the abundance
                                of cloths of many kinds in the principal cities of the interior, as
                                San Luis Potosi and Zacatecas, in which the articles are sold much
                                cheaper than in this port. Lately a merchant arrived at San Luis
                                Potosi from Matamoras with more than three hundred packs of cloths,
                                and sold calico at five dollars per piece; and if the great distance
                                between Matamoras and San Luis be taken into consideration, it will
                                easily be perceived that these goods have paid no duties when they
                                can be sold at so low a price, after the heavy expenses of
                                transportation. This evil probably results from the port being
                                established at Matamoras, while it may be avoided by fixing it at
                                Bagdad.</p>
                            <p>“It may also result from the Free Zone, which is enjoyed by all the
                                northern frontier, a privilege which was granted in consequence of
                                the special circumstances which existed in that section at the time
                                it was granted, and which do not now exist, and under cover of that
                                Zone an immense injury is inflicted upon the national revenues. From
                                    <pb n="492" xml:id="pg_492" facs="0526"/>Ciudad Victoria, the
                                capital of this state, and from other places in Nuevo Leon and San
                                Luis, such as Matehudla and Linaves, which formerly were supplied
                                from this port, they now buy all their merchandise at Matamoras in
                                spite of their greater distance from that port than from Tampico,
                                because they invariably get their goods cheaper than their value
                                here; consequently the Free Zone may be considered as a convenient
                                safeguard for contraband trade.</p>
                            <p>“The Free Zone being, therefore, a system which causes such detriment
                                to the other ports within the republic, especially to those which,
                                like Tampico, are situated in the Gulf, since they suffer a ruinous
                                competition in the interior towns upon the same latitude, it is
                                necessary to find some resource which may promptly repress this evil
                                which weighs so heavily upon commerce in general, and upon the
                                national revenues, defrauding them of their just dues, while a few
                                speculators speedily enrich themselves at the general expense, a
                                real monopoly, which, as such, is prohibited by our constitution,
                                and condemned by all the principles of distributive justice.</p>
                            <p>“This resource can be no other than that of obliging all the ports of
                                the republic, without exception, to abide by the general tariff, for
                                the law ought to be the same for all, especially in regard to
                                contributions and dues, since upon their equalization and strict
                                observance depend the receipts of the national treasury.”</p>
                            <p>In the opinion of the orators who defend the Free Zone, as I have
                                already mentioned, it not only does not favor contraband trade, but
                                is its principal, and almost its only remedy. Let us examine their
                                reasons for this opinion. Before the establishment of the Zone, say
                                they, foreign goods were brought into Mexico by the numerous fords
                                of the Rio Bravo, and were not destined, as they have been since the
                                existence of the Zone, to the frontier settlements. As it is much
                                easier to watch over five localities than over a line of a hundred
                                leagues in extent, they judge that the Zone has operated against
                                contraband trade. They say also that, by reason of the said Zone,
                                the goods which are dispatched from the frontier settlements, either
                                for the consumption of another locality within the Zone or for the
                                interior of the republic, have to be furnished with passes, and that
                                these precautions are more than sufficient to repress smuggling.</p>
                            <p>These reasons may convince their own authors, but, in my judgment,
                                they have no force whatever, and my opinion, in this respect, is
                                confirmed by experience. The provision in the decree establishing
                                the Free Zone that merchandise imported into the frontier
                                settlements be brought by way of the authorized fords and the points
                                designated by, for foreign traffic, cannot carry with it its own
                                fulfillment. It existed long before the Free Zone, and then, as now,
                                it was violated by unscrupulous speculators. In fact, all our
                                tariffs have ordained that the importation of foreign goods be made
                                only at properly authorized points, and have considered all
                                importations through other routes as frauds, which should be
                                punished by severe penalties. This regulation, then, is the same as
                                that of the same decree, and was more efficacious since its
                                violation was visited with severe punishments, but neither then nor
                                now has it ever been properly enforced. And for what reason? Because
                                the promulgation of a law does not suffice to carry it into
                                execution, but it is absolutely necessary to employ other means to
                                that end. In the absence of such means along our extended frontier,
                                it is clear that the mere publication, either of the tariff law or
                                of the decree concerning the Zone, will not suffice to prevent
                                importations by unauthorized routes.</p>
                            <p>But we are told that no merchant could be tempted to import his goods
                                through unauthorized routes, under peril of confiscation, when he is
                                permitted to import them into the settlements without payment of
                                federal duties, and can either keep them in deposit as long as he
                                chooses, or consume them duty free within the Zone. It is true that
                                when the merchandise is intended for consumption within the Zone,
                                there can be no object in importing them through unauthorized
                                routes, and then no contraband trade is intended; but it is not the
                                same when the goods are intended for illicit traffic. One of two
                                things, then, necessarily happens—either the smuggler counts upon
                                the connivance of the customs authorities, and in this case imports
                                them through the authorized points, having no temptation to do
                                otherwise, or he does not count upon that connivance, and then he
                                does not import them by the authorized points, because it does not
                                suit him to do so. And what is to prevent him from importing through
                                unauthorized points? Merely a legal text, which is equally
                                inoperative, whether contained in the law concerning the Zone or in
                                any other. It may be seen then, that if, as the defenders of the
                                Zone assure us, during its existence we ought only to keep watch
                                over five localities on the frontier, by this means fraudulent
                                importations are encouraged, as they no longer suffer peril of any
                                vigilance at the unauthorized routes, through which they may operate
                                with entire impunity.</p>
                            <p>Another of the reasons alleged to prove that the Zone is a remedy for
                                contraband traffic is, that the goods which are dispatched from the
                                frontier settlements, whether for consumption within the territory
                                of the Zone or without it, are obliged to carry passes and present
                                return passes, in proof of having paid the proper duties. In this
                                case I have to repeat exactly what I said in the previous one, that
                                is, that these precautions and restrictions against fraud existed
                                also before the establishment of the Free Zone, and are as
                                inefficacious now as formerly. In fact, before the decree concerning
                                    <pb n="493" xml:id="pg_493" facs="0527"/>the Zone, it was the
                                rule that foreign goods imported into the ports of the republic
                                could not be sent into the interior without being accompanied by the
                                proper passes, with the obligation to present the return passes
                                within a certain period. The legislation upon the subject was much
                                more complete than the few provisions respecting it in the decree
                                concerning the Zone, and nevertheless, at that time as well as now,
                                these provisions were insufficient to prevent fraud.</p>
                            <p>It is evident, then, that the two principal reasons which the
                                advocates of the Free Zone present, as conclusive to demonstrate
                                that the Zone is the most efficacious remedy against fraud, are
                                really puerile.</p>
                            <p>We have been interrogated several times as to how frauds can be
                                committed in the Free Zone, and the reply is very simple. Either the
                                smuggler succeeds in coming to an understanding with the customs
                                officers, in order to commit a fraud, or he does not. In the first
                                place, everything is done without the Zone being able to prevent it.
                                In the second case, the smuggler has two courses to follow; the
                                first being to import his goods through some uninhabited route, by
                                which he may carry them to the interior of the republic. As in the
                                states adjacent to Tamaulipas no excises exist, no documents are
                                required, and the smuggler can introduce his goods with absolute
                                impunity. All the danger consists in the possibility of meeting with
                                the customs guards, and, at present, with the sections of the
                                counter-guard on the northern frontier. If he succeeds in escaping
                                the vigilance of these employés, which is very easy in so
                                considerable an extent of territory watched over by a very small
                                number of persons, the fraud is consummated. This, nevertheless, is
                                the least probable expedient, and it is also the most perilous.</p>
                            <p>The second course consists in importing the merchandise through some
                                of the authorized routes, and then send it with the proper
                                passes-for some point within the Zone. When there, false witnesses
                                can be found to swear that the goods have been consumed, in which
                                case a return pass is issued, to be presented at the original
                                customhouse to cancel the pending bond. The goods can then be sent
                                clandestinely into the interior. The same thing can be done by the
                                merchant in the very place of importation, by adducing false proofs
                                that his merchandise has been consumed in the same place.</p>
                            <p>It is then evident that all known methods of contraband traffic which
                                existed before the Zone are still in existence, and have been
                                increased by new ones before unknown.</p>
                            <p>I am far from believing that the author of the decree concerning the
                                Free Zone, and the advocates of that institution, propose to foment
                                contraband trade by its means. On the contrary, I take pleasure in
                                recognizing that the deputy of the northern district of Tamaulipas,
                                who is, therefore, the most directly interested in the maintenance
                                of the Free Zone, has given proof that he does not desire to
                                encourage smuggling, by working earnestly for the law which
                                established the counter-guards on the northern frontier, and by
                                lending the executive his aid, in order that this institution may
                                yield the good results which are expected from it.</p>
                            <p>Returning to the decree of March 17, 1858, I ought to state that the
                                defenders of the Zone think that all its inconveniences are remedied
                                by the 53d article of the tariff bill, because it designates exactly
                                the places which are to enjoy the privilege of the Zone, and that)
                                consequently, this article repeals the conflicting provisions of
                                that decree, and explains those of doubtful interpretation. This
                                reasoning would be valid if the chapter of the tariff bill relating
                                to the Free Zone had no other article than the 53d, but the precise
                                language of the 54th article destroys all this reasoning. This
                                article is as follows:</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">“Article</hi> 54. In order to enjoy this
                                exemption, the decree issued by the government of Tamaulipas on
                                March 17, 1858, and ratified by the general Congress on July 30,
                                1861, shall be obeyed in its main scope, <hi rend="italic">except in
                                    the penal portion.</hi> In that respect the provisions of
                                chapter 18 shall be respected.”</p>
                            <p>It is then clear that, although it is first said that the provisions
                                of the decree shall be obeyed <hi rend="italic">in its main
                                    scope,</hi> this limitation is explained by the declaration that
                                it shall hold good in all except the penal portion, which is
                                certainly that of least importance. Besides, as all the provisions
                                of the decree relating to the Free Zone are included in its <hi
                                    rend="italic">main scope,</hi> they all remain in force except
                                the penal portion, which is expressly revoked.</p>
                            <p>We have a plain proof of this fact. The decree of the second Congress
                                of the Union, dated July 30, 1861, which ratified the Free Zone, is
                                conceived in almost the same terms as the 53d article of the tariff
                                bill; that is, the settlements which are to enjoy the benefit of the
                                Free Zone are mentioned, and reference is made to the decree of
                                March 17, 1858. It has been understood since then that the decree is
                                in force in all its parts, and this has also been the practice.</p>
                            <p>Besides this, the approbation of these two articles of the tariff
                                bill would amount to a change in the prudent conduct which the
                                Congress of the Union has observed of never giving its approval to
                                legislative measures which have once been in force without
                                discussion of each of their articles.</p>
                            <p>The terms of article 53 imply, moreover, an important and
                                transcendent constitutional <pb n="494" xml:id="pg_494" facs="0528"
                                />question. By it certain places are designated in which the
                                importation of foreign goods is free. These places are now open to
                                foreign commerce. While they so continue there can be no difficulty
                                in making importations through them; but if circumstances should
                                ever demand that one or more of these points be closed to foreign
                                commerce, a grave difficulty would arise. The fact of their being
                                named in the tariff throws them open to foreign commerce by
                                legislative enactment. If it should become expedient, and even
                                necessary, to close them to such commerce, as has already been
                                proposed, the executive would be placed under a painful alternative,
                                either to refuse to exercise a prerogative granted him by the
                                constitution, in order not to violate a law of Congress, thus
                                seriously affecting, in the supposed case, the public interests; or,
                                should he act upon the belief that Congress cannot deprive him of
                                this faculty except by previously modifying the constitution through
                                all the prerequisites established for so doing, he might then be
                                impelled to abrogate a legislative enactment. In this case, in
                                addition to the inconvenience which would result from the
                                executive’s abrogating or modifying the laws, he might be accused
                                before the national grand jury in the midst of perils of another
                                character.</p>
                            <p>If we were to credit the statements of the advocates of the Free
                                Zone, it would be necessary to recognize that upon this institution
                                depend, not merely the well-being and prosperity of the frontier
                                settlements, but their very existence, that of the state of
                                Tamaulipas, and of the entire nation. Unfortunately for the friends
                                of the Free Zone, this proposition is untenable. Congress has just
                                heard a deputy, not from the interior, but from the very state of
                                Tamaulipas, who has raised his voice against the Free Zone, not
                                merely in the abstract, but as a question of life or death for the
                                south of Tamaulipas. The representative for the southern district of
                                that state has so stated, not solely upon his own word, but reading
                                communications from merchants at Tampico, which assert that the
                                continuance of the Free Zone would be the complete ruin of that
                                port. This statement is neither unfounded nor incorrect. The
                                custom-house of Tampico, which for many years was the second one of
                                the republic, its revenue being inferior only to that of Vera Cruz,
                                is now in such a state of decadence that, on account of the Free
                                Zone, it has become a custom-house of the third or fourth order, and
                                cannot even pay the expenses of the military force which receives
                                its payment through it.</p>
                            <p>It is seen, then, that this institution of the Free Zone is not even
                                accepted by the citizens of the very state in whose favor it was
                                established; that if it has caused prosperity in some points on the
                                frontier, which, in my opinion, has been upon a very small scale, it
                                has, in exchange, ruined others which formerly enjoyed prosperity,
                                and causes grave damage not only to other places in the state of
                                Tamaulipas, remote from the frontier, but also to the nation in
                                general. The Congress of the Uni on, which does not represent a
                                single locality, but the entire republic, has the right and the duty
                                to combine in its laws local with national interests, subordinating
                                when necessary the former to the latter.</p>
                            <p>The prosperity which the frontier has at some time enjoyed, and which
                                is represented to us as exclusively the result of the Free Zone, is,
                                in my opinion, rather due to the civil war in the United States,
                                which for some time made the cotton trade one of great profit to the
                                inhabitants of Matamoras and other frontier towns, in consequence of
                                the blockade of the southern ports by the United States Government.
                                The Free Zone was undoubtedly one of the causes of prosperity, but
                                could never be sufficient of itself to cause the transformation on
                                the frontier which we witnessed from 1862 to 1866.</p>
                            <p>If we were to believe the defenders of the Free Zone, we ought to
                                believe that from the time of its establishment, far from the
                                inhabitants of our side of the Rio Bravo emigrating to the other, as
                                formerly, the emigration would have changed its course, and that we
                                should now be absorbing the inhabitants from the left side of the
                                river. Unfortunately this is not the case, in spite of the efforts
                                made to convince us of it, in order to preengage the opinion of the
                                chamber in favor of the Free Zone. A deputy now present in Congress,
                                and who had just passed through the State of Texas, told me
                                yesterday that the current of emigration continues to flow, as
                                formerly, from our territory to that of the United States, the Free
                                Zone not being a sufficient inducement for those of our citizens who
                                desired greater stability and security to remain in our territory. I
                                make the statement because the honorable deputy, Don Enrique Mejia,
                                to whom I allude, authorized me to do so, and he may correct the
                                statement if he should think proper.</p>
                            <p>It follows, then, that there is much exaggeration in what we are told
                                concerning the magic effects of the Free Zone in behalf of the
                                frontier and of the whole nation. A single fact, which I will
                                mention to conclude my observations upon this point, proves the
                                inexactness of the prodigious effects attributed to the Free Zone.
                                In Paso del Norte there is no Free Zone, since it now only includes
                                the state of Tamaulipas. Opposite Paso del Norte is an American town
                                called Franklin, as there are also towns opposite each of the
                                settlements on the frontier of Tamaulipas. As the same causes now
                                exist there which, before the establishment of the Free Zone, made
                                the frontier of Tamaulipas a place of decadence and almost
                                uninhabitable, the effects of these same causes at Paso del Norte
                                ought to be identical. To judge by what we have heard in favor of
                                the Free Zone, we should suppose that Paso del Norte is an
                                insignificant hamlet, <pb n="495" xml:id="pg_495" facs="0529"/>which
                                would only have, as inhabitants, a few true heroes who preferred
                                their patriotic sentiments to their well-being and every other
                                consideration, while Franklin should be a populous city, and in a
                                state of growth and prosperity. Far from this being the case, Paso
                                del Norte contains a population of from five to six thousand
                                inhabitants, while in Franklin there are barely from five to six
                                hundred, most of them being the forces of the line with which the
                                Government of the United States guards its frontiers. This shows
                                that the situation of the inhabitants of our territory is not so
                                desperate as we are told, and that they do not so absolutely need
                                the Free Zone in order to exist and prosper.</p>
                            <p>Another consideration has been presented by the defenders of the Free
                                Zone, which I think has weight in the opposite scale. It consists of
                                the menace that the frontier settlements would rebel against the
                                authorities of the republic if Congress should deprive them of the
                                Free Zone. Either I am very much mistaken, or the Congress of the
                                Union will not be influenced in its decisions by threats of this
                                kind, and much less when there is reason to believe that these
                                threats proceed not from the mass of the people, but from the
                                imperiled interests of a few speculators.</p>
                            <p>Hitherto I have treated only of the inconveniences of the
                                ratification of the Free Zone as it now exists. These inconveniences
                                would be very considerably increased if that Zone were to be
                                extended, as the committee proposes, to other states, some of them
                                not even upon the frontier. In fact, if the Free Zone produces the
                                serious results already mentioned while it is confined to the
                                territory of Tamaulipas, extensive in itself, but small in
                                comparison with the proposed extension to Paso del Norte, these
                                serious results will, in that case, become incalculable. It will
                                then embrace two more frontier states, and one which is not such,
                                and which, for that very reason, has no valid pretext for soliciting
                                this privilege.</p>
                            <p>The existence of the Free Zone in Tamaulipas is an evil for many
                                persons who have acquired interests there, which render its
                                abolition difficult, even when such abolition is proved to be based
                                upon just, convenient, and economical reasons. It is evident that in
                                that case these persons cannot favor the extension of the Free Zone,
                                which they know to be an evil, which, when once established, will
                                create interests very difficult to remedy. It is short-sighted to
                                raise up obstacles which may ultimately become serious, merely in
                                order to pretend that the Free Zone is not a privilege.</p>
                            <p>If Congress should now approve, not merely the subsistence of the
                                Free Zone in Tamaulipas, but its prolongation to three other states
                                of the republic, it is to me very probable and almost certain that
                                the evil results accruing therefrom sooner or later will make
                                themselves generally felt, and it will be thought absolutely
                                necessary to extirpate the evil by suppressing the Free Zone. How
                                much more difficult will this be if the Zone is so enlarged as to
                                foster the creation of interests which may become really formidable!
                                If at present the interests created in a district of one of the
                                states can even resort to threats, what would happen when this
                                privilege shall be extended to three more states?</p>
                            <p>The idea of extending the Free Zone beyond its actual limits arose
                                from the desire of doing away with the character of a <hi
                                    rend="italic">privilege</hi> which is inherent to the Zone, by
                                demonstrating that it may be conceded to any frontier territory.
                                This object has not been attained by the committee’s report; for
                                either the frontier ought to enjoy this privilege, and in this case
                                it is inconceivable that Sonora, Lower California, Chiapas, Tabasco,
                                and Yucatan should be excluded, or it belongs not only to the
                                frontier states, but also to those bordering on the frontier states,
                                and then it cannot be understood why it should be granted to Nuevo
                                Leon and denied to Durango, Sinaloa, Oaxaca, and Vera Cruz.</p>
                            <p>In view of the reasons which have been alleged in favor of the Free
                                Zone, it would appear natural that only frontier settlements should
                                call for this privilege. Nevertheless, we see that it is now
                                proposed to grant it to Nuevo Leon, which has no frontier. I have
                                carefully read the speech of the honorable deputy who recently
                                advocated the right of Nuevo Leon to participate in the Free Zone,
                                and I confess that my limited intelligence could find but one real
                                reason which has any force in favor of "this pretended right. This
                                reason, if it may be so called, is that, although Nuevo Leon has no
                                frontier, a part of its territory is very near the frontier, and
                                that the state of Tamaulipas lies between it and the frontier. I
                                think that this same reason might be alleged by several other states
                                of the republic; San Luis might say that Tamaulipas lies between her
                                and the frontier; Zacatecas, that Coahuila lies between her and the
                                frontier; and the same argument might be repeated by Durango,
                                Sinaloa, Oaxaca, and Vera Cruz. Evidently, if all these states had
                                chanced to possess a portion of the frontier, they might all demand
                                the privilege which is alleged to belong to the frontier; but in
                                that case no others than the really frontier states have any right
                                to enjoy such a privilege.</p>
                            <p>I intended to reply to various allusions made by some of the speakers
                                who have defended the Free Zone, and correct some mistakes which, in
                                my judgment, they have made; but having already occupied the
                                attention of the chamber longer than I wished, and as I shall
                                probably have to occupy it again, as I understand that the debate is
                                to continue, I reserve further statements until its close, and
                                refrain for the present from replying to those allusions, and from
                                rectifying those errors.</p>
                            <pb n="496" xml:id="pg_496" facs="0530"/>
                            <p>In conclusion I will sum up as follows the ideas of the executive
                                concerning the Free Zone:</p>
                            <p>1. The Free Zone, as it now exists, is a <hi rend="italic"
                                    >privilege,</hi> such as is prohibited by the constitution; one
                                which injures a part of the very state of Tamaulipas and the entire
                                nation.</p>
                            <p>2. It is the duty of the government of the union to endeavor to
                                prevent the situation of the frontier settlements from becoming less
                                favorable than that of their neighbors, and to that end ought to
                                grant them all necessary exemptions.</p>
                            <p>3. The Free Zone is not absolutely indispensable to that end.</p>
                            <p>4. Even in case that Congress should ratify that Zone, it should
                                provide such regulations that the interior commerce of the republic
                                shall not remain at the mercy of the enactments of the legislature
                                of a single state.</p>
                            <p>5. The extension of the Free Zone to other states, and especially to
                                such as have no frontier, would occasion innumerable evils.</p>

                                    Don Ramon Guzman in the Mexican Congress, in the session of

                                    maintenance of the Free Zone.</hi></p>
                            <p>The maintenance of the Free Zone may be considered under two
                                aspects—as an economical question, and as a political question. I
                                shall examine the former under three heads: first, what our frontier
                                was before it became a free zone; second, what it now is, under the
                                operation of its present exemptions; and third, what it will become,
                                unfortunately, the law in question should be repealed.</p>
                            <p>Our population on the Rio Grande, at the conclusion of the treaty of
                                Guadalupe Hidalgo, was about 30,000 souls, scattered through many
                                villages and hamlets. The Americans, who always make correct
                                calculations, immediately established in front of each of our
                                settlements a military post and a custom-house, with bonded
                                warehouses. They had no settlements in which to sell their
                                merchandise, for this region was all a desert. They came and took up
                                their stations at these posts in order to compete with our merchants
                                for the trade of our frontier. Their system of bonded warehouses,
                                with the exemptions from all duties enjoyed by their national
                                manufactures, necessarily annihilated the commercial activity of the
                                Mexican shore; caused its inhabitants to engage in smuggling, to the
                                neglect of agriculture; and finally, when they had become
                                impoverished through lack of work, led them to abandon their native
                                soil in search of that subsistence which our fiscal system denied
                                them. At that time the Mexican tariff was higher than that of the
                                United States. The duties were collected then as now, at the moment
                                of importation, and certain fords were designated for the passage of
                                merchandise, outside of which it ran the risk of confiscation. The
                                American bonded warehouses had no other object than to hold the
                                goods destined to a contraband trade with Mexico. After three years
                                of this unequal struggle, the Americans had gained over to their
                                territory the majority of our population. Our landed property had
                                lost its value; the commerce of Matamoras, our principal town, was
                                reduced to two retail houses, and the few inhabitants of the Mexican
                                bank had to become professional smugglers. From the authorities down
                                to the humblest laborer—some of necessity, and others as a
                                speculation—incessantly crossed the river, bringing back goods at 50
                                per cent, less than their cost on this side. Our custom-houses did
                                not pay the salaries of their own officers, and they received their
                                money from Mexico.</p>
                            <p>After three years’ experience of these miseries, the government, in
                                1851, sent General Don Manuel Robles Pezuela to study the condition
                                and the necessities of the frontier. From his luminous report sprang
                                the idea of a Free Zone, which was sent the next year to the chamber
                                on the part of the executive. Unfortunately the influence of foreign
                                ministers in the high regions of power was then irresistible. A <hi
                                    rend="italic">friendly intervention</hi> was decisive. Above
                                all, the recollections of the American invasion were very fresh, and
                                that proposal of the executive, through the lukewarmness of the
                                cabinet, and for another reason which I must not name, had the
                                misfortune to be rejected. But at a later day, in 1858, during the
                                war of reform, and under the influence of General Garza, the decree
                                of the Free Zone was issued.</p>
                            <p>The inhabitants of both shores immediately perceived that, in the
                                competition between the fiscal systems of the two peoples, the
                                advantage had changed to the right bank. The difference was very
                                soon felt. The American warehouses began to be closed; European
                                cargoes no longer landed on the left side of the river; our lands
                                increased in value; the population augmented so rapidly that from
                                18,000, to which it was reduced in 1858, it reached 50,000 in five
                                years. Later came the exceptional circumstances of the cotton trade
                                during the confederate rebellion, which produced an artificial and
                                transient increase of population, at one time amounting to 150,000,
                                and the remnant of which still leaves us the 70,000 assigned by the
                                census to the frontier of Tamaulipas.</p>
                            <p>The national treasury enjoyed a proportional increase of revenue; and
                                after paying all expenses and covering numerous letters of credit,
                                the custom-houses made considerable monthly remissions to the
                                treasury department. Smuggling, which was so easy <pb n="497"
                                    xml:id="pg_497" facs="0531"/>when there was only the frontier to
                                cross, now became more difficult through the system of passes and of
                                inspectors upon the roads leading to the interior. And if the
                                secretary of the treasury had subordinated the custom-houses of
                                Laredo, Camargo, Linares, and other towns to that of Matamoras, and
                                had exercised greater vigilance over the morality of his employés,
                                the contraband traffic would have become insignificant. Since the
                                establishment of the <hi rend="italic">contra-resguardo</hi> (second
                                line of inspection) this evil has largely decreased. The proof is
                                that the custom-house orders, which were worth but a short time
                                since only 20 to 30 per cent., have trebled in value within the two
                                months which have elapsed since the establishment of the <hi
                                    rend="italic">contra-resguardo.</hi></p>
                            <p>The third point of my inquiry, as to what would take place if the
                                Free Zone should unfortunately be abolished, may be briefly
                                dismissed. The inhabitants of that region, who have given such
                                proofs of their love for liberty, distinguishing themselves in the
                                wars of independence and reform, would certainly oppose, with arms
                                in their hands, a measure intended to deprive them of their liberty
                                and their well-being. I am told that the government is strong enough
                                to conquer them with two divisions of its army. In that case, this
                                people, warlike by instinct and resolute in the maintenance of its
                                rights, would cross in a body to the American shore, leaving the
                                ashes of their homesteads as trophies to their oppressors.</p>
                            <p>The enemies of the Free Zone repeat that it is a <hi rend="italic"
                                    >privilege</hi> which is prohibited by our constitution. I
                                consider that a <hi rend="italic">privilege</hi> is that exceptional
                                advantage which is granted to an individual, a corporation, or a
                                locality, by which, under an equality of circumstances with others,
                                an exclusive benefit is granted, to the detriment of the rest. But
                                what port is there on the Gulf or on the Pacific which has in front
                                of it, at a hundred paces off, a foreign port? Ought we not to
                                remember that this colossal power, which has located eight
                                custom-houses, with bonded warehouses, along a desert line of only
                                eighty leagues, intends to build up its own settlements at our
                                expense? Would not the derogation of the law which has created so
                                many interests on our frontier favor the American interests, to the
                                immense detriment of our own?</p>
                            <p>To vote against these interests is to attack the interests of the
                                nation; and if my own reasoning lacks vigor, and my tongue the
                                necessary eloquence to prove this, my esteemed companion, Mr.
                                Velasco, will read the report of a committee of the American Senate,
                                in which it recognizes the right of Mexico to adopt the financial
                                laws which it may deem proper. It argues that the maintenance of the
                                Free Zone is a serious detriment to their views for the future, and
                                that fact speaks louder in its favor than anything my feeble voice
                                can utter. I wall add, however, that when the government did me the
                                honor to appoint me, along with Mr. Castañeda, to draw up a tariff
                                bill, which is very nearly the same as that before us, <hi
                                    rend="italic">suggestions were made to us</hi>, <hi
                                    rend="italic">on the part of the United States Government</hi>,
                                    <hi rend="italic">which I am not at liberty to reveal</hi>, <hi
                                    rend="italic">tending to the suppression of the Free Zone</hi>,
                                    <hi rend="italic">and, as may be seen, we energetically repelled
                                    them.</hi></p>
                            <p>I very much wonder, and I call the attention of the chamber to this
                                subject, that the secretary of the treasury has not a single word of
                                disapproval for the Leese contract for the colonization of Lower
                                California, by which the colonists import, free of duty, goods of
                                every kind, and are granted greater privileges than those enjoyed by
                                our brothers of the northern frontier. Nevertheless, his excellency
                                finds no difficulty in granting to strangers what he refuses to
                                Mexicans. Is it because the former speak English, and the latter,
                                the poor Spanish tongue?</p>
                            <p>I cannot understand how the interests of the United States should be
                                upheld among us in opposition to those of Mexico. Do not think that
                                I bear any ill-will toward that people which was our friend in the
                                hour of misfortune. No, sir. I love it, I admire it, and wish it all
                                prosperity; but not to the detriment of Mexico. I propose no
                                aggression; but that, strong in our right, we do not accept a
                                friendly intervention after having repulsed an armed intervention. I
                                wish for a reciprocity of interests in our relations, and especially
                                upon our northern frontier; and as we endured for twelve years while
                                they maintained in front of us their ports of deposit, let them now
                                endure the continuance of the Free Zone; and if the competition
                                should be pursued, let us, in turn, endure their establishment of
                                free ports. The real sovereignty of the people would be outraged
                                were we to forget our duties. The United States are great and
                                strong, but they are also just.</p>

                        <p>S<hi rend="smallcaps">ir</hi>: After a protracted debate, in which, the
                            Mexican government, through the secretary of the treasury, Mr. Romero,
                            has made great <pb n="498" xml:id="pg_498" facs="0532"/>efforts for the
                            abolition of the Free Zone, Congress, on the 5th instant, not only
                            formally sanctioned that measure, but extended it over the frontiers of
                            Coahuila and Chihuahua and to the northern district of Nuevo Leon.
                            Notwithstanding the decisive vote by which this result was obtained, (85
                            to 37,) there is still hope that it may not become a law, as the
                            President will undoubtedly use his constitutional prerogative of
                            retaining the bill in his hands till near the close of the session, and
                            then returning it with objections. Even should it become a law, Mr.
                            Romero is confident that the great practical inconveniences of the
                            measure will erelong become so apparent that it will be repealed after a
                            very brief experiment of its workings.</p>

                            Romero; also a synopsis (B) of a speech in its favor by the deputy

                            <p>Mr. Romero began by quoting document in disproof of a charge made by
                                Deputy Guzman, that the contraband trade upon the frontier might
                                have been greatly diminished had the secretary of the treasury taken
                                the proper steps to secure a vigilant administration on the part of
                                the customs authorities. He then met another charge of the same
                                deputy, to the effect that the executive had, of his own authority,
                                conceded a reduction of duties to the frontier of Chihuahua, by the
                                statement that that decree was issued when the national government
                                was temporarily residing in that state, and was by virtue of the
                                extraordinary powers” which the President then possessed, but that
                                upon the return of the government to the city of Mexico that measure
                                was rescinded In reply to another charge against the Government of
                                the United States, Mr. Romero then spoke as follows:</p>
                            <p>“Another of the errors into which the same orator has fallen is that
                                of stating that the Government of the United States solicited from
                                the usurpers Miramon and Maximilian the abrogation of the Free Zone.
                                In conformity with his plan of leading this chamber to believe that
                                the opinion of the executive, in opposition to the Free Zone, is the
                                result of its subserviency to the cabinet at Washington, he praises
                                the conduct of those pretended governments by comparison with the
                                present administration. I doubt whether the honorable deputy
                                believes what he has told us, and, if he does, it only shows how
                                easily he gives credence to the most unfounded and most improbable
                                rumors, and how innocently he tries to make this chamber share his
                                mistakes.</p>
                            <p>“The Government of the United States could never solicit from Miramon
                                nor from Maximilian the suppression of the Free Zone, nor anything
                                else, for the simple reason that it was never in relations with
                                them. It is true that Mr. Forsyth, minister from the United States
                                to Mexico in 1857, recognized Don Felix Zuloaga as president, but he
                                did so without instructions, and soon after had to break off his
                                relation with that so-called administration, before Don Miguel
                                Miramon came to power. After this, the Government of the United
                                States recognized the constitutional President of the Republic, then
                                at Vera Cruz, and maintained relations with him until the close of
                                the war of reform. The whole world knows, and it is wonderful that
                                there should beany one here who does not know, that the Government
                                of the United States never recognized either the intervention or the
                                so-called empire, nor maintained relations of any kind with either
                                the one or the other. Persons who are unacquainted with the rules
                                which guide the conduct of the cabinet at Washington may assert that
                                on one occasion or another it employed confidential agents; but this
                                assertion will only prove their absolute ignorance of the
                                established customs of that Government.”</p>
                            <p>Mr. Romero then argues that the non-interference of the imperial
                                government with the Free Zone is easily accounted for by the fact
                                that it was never in possession of the frontier, and that its hold
                                upon Matamoras was always very precarious. Besides, he would not, if
                                he could, have suppressed the Free Zone at a time when such a
                                measure would have driven the frontier settlers into the ranks of
                                the liberals. Maximilian would, however, have abolished the Free
                                Zone ten times over, had it been possible, if by that means he could
                                have obtained the recognition of the United States.</p>
                            <pb n="499" xml:id="pg_499" facs="0533"/>
                            <p>Mr. Romero then impugns the speech of the deputy from the northern
                                district of Tamaulipas, (Mr. Emilio Velasco,) who had charged him
                                personally with ignorance and incompetence. However this might be,
                                the secretary of the treasury had presented himself in that chamber
                                to express not merely his own opinions but those of the executive,
                                upon whom the same charges would therefore fall. “Those who know the
                                President of the republic know that he studies for himself all
                                public questions, forms his own opinions, and has sufficient force
                                of character to maintain them whatever may be the opposing
                                interests. In the question of the Free Zone, as well as that of
                                ports of deposit, his interest has been so great that the persons
                                who have visited him recently, when he was lying upon what was
                                supposed to be his death-bed, can testify that he concerned himself
                                with these two subjects much more than with his own existence.</p>
                            <p>“Both of the orators to whom I am replying have thought fit, in order
                                to defend the Free Zone, to have recourse to documents published by
                                a foreign government, they have called the attention of Congress to
                                the report of a committee of the United States Senate upon the Free
                                Zone, treating it as a decisive document, almost as an oracle, each
                                word of which is full of wisdom upon the various phases of the
                                question of the Free Zone. The honorable deputy who has just spoken
                                (Mr. Velasco) said that the committee which drew up this report was
                                especially appointed to study the question of the Free Zone. This is
                                a great mistake. The committee referred to is called the Joint
                                Committee on Retrenchment, being composed of members of the two
                                houses, whose duty it is to seek the means of alleviating the
                                financial burdens of the country. This report of the Senate
                                Committee on Retrenchment was presented May 16, of the present year.
                                The newspapers of the United States reproduced its principal
                                contents, and we thus learned its chief points before we saw the
                                document itself. It may be asserted without exaggeration that this
                                document is one of those which have been written with least
                                foundation; and yet it is cited by the defenders of the Free Zone as
                                a conclusive argument in favor of their theories. The members of
                                this committee thought proper to take the sworn testimony of four
                                witnesses, who deposed not merely concerning the Free Zone and the
                                frauds which it shelters, but gave utterance to notoriously false
                                statements concerning the intentions of the Mexican government
                                toward the cause of the American Union, concerning our supposed
                                sympathy for the southern rebels, our hypocrisy toward both
                                belligerents, and the imaginary assistance which we lent to the
                                rebellion. I have marked several passages in those depositions,
                                which I am sure would stir up the patriotism of Congress were I to
                                read them, but to be brief I will only make a slight summary of
                                them. One witness says that when he was at Monterey the President of
                                the republic went to his house to visit him. Those who know the
                                President s character can judge of the probability of this statement
                                j and besides, the President remembers perfectly well that while he
                                was in Monterey he did not visit anybody, native or foreign.</p>
                            <p>“Another witness relates a conversation held with the President, in
                                the presence of eight or ten witnesses, in which he expressed the
                                greatest sympathy with the southern rebels. As the result of this
                                conversation he states that a decree was issued, through the state
                                and war departments, permitting the selling of arms to the Southern
                                States. All who have ever spoken even once with the President know
                                his natural reserve, and those who are better acquainted with him
                                know that he never expressed an opinion upon a public subject in the
                                presence of persons not on terms of intimacy, much less before
                                strangers. Any one who may search for a decree issued while the
                                President was at Monterey, relative to the exportation of arms to
                                the Southern States, will easily ascertain that none such
                                exists.</p>
                            <p>“Another witness asserts that the President s sympathy for the
                                southern rebels went so far as to send them arms and ammunition We
                                all know that if the President had then had any arms at his disposal
                                he would have made good use of them in defense of the national
                                cause, and never in favor of a cause linked with that of the French
                                intervention in Mexico. We all know that this intervention was
                                projected and carried out at a time when the success of the southern
                                insurrection was considered certain. Those Mexicans who were hostile
                                to the intervention, and I think that, the President of the republic
                                may be considered as one of them, were then highly interested, if
                                for no other reason than their own convenience, in the subjugation
                                of that insurrection; and it is not probable that any one of them,
                                much less the President, upon whom weighed such heavy
                                responsibilities, would be disposed to contribute by word or deed to
                                the triumph of the intervention. These statements, absurd as they
                                are, were those upon which the report of the Senate Committee on
                                Retrenchment was based. It may be understood, then, why it is so
                                hostile to our country, so exaggerated and incorrect in regard to
                                our actions.</p>
                            <p>“In honor of public opinion in the United States it is proper to
                                state that it immediately perceived how lightly those Senators had
                                acted-in giving credence to the false and improbable testimony of
                                these four witnesses. It is, nevertheless, the same document to
                                which the two orators, who have most energetically defended the Free
                                Zone, have referred as to a model of exactness in its opinions, and
                                of accuracy in its statements. I also might find in it an arsenal of
                                reasons to prove the impropriety of our maintaining <pb n="500"
                                    xml:id="pg_500" facs="0534"/>and extending the Free Zone; but I
                                have preferred not to do so, because I think je have no need of
                                appealing to foreign authorities in settling our own questions, and
                                further reference to that document would only ascribe to it an
                                importance which it does not, in itself, possess.”</p>
                            <p>Mr. Romero then alludes to the argument derived from the wonderful
                                prosperity of the Mexican hank of the Rio Grande since 1858, and the
                                recent corresponding decadence of the American hank. He attributes
                                both these events to the effects of the American cavil war, to the
                                temporary traffic in cotton upon the frontier, and the collapse of
                                that traffic at the close of the war. He defends the United States
                                Government from the charge of hostility towards that of Mexico on
                                account of having established twenty military posts on the,
                                frontier, and having opened several ports of deposit, showing that
                                such is the custom of the American Government respecting all their
                                frontiers.</p>
                            <p>“The desire of some of the defenders of the Free Zone seems to be to
                                convert our side of the river into the basis of a contraband traffic
                                with the United States. The executive cannot follow them upon this
                                path, and, without losing sight of any of the national interests
                                committed to his charge, thinks it is his duty to lay before
                                Congress all the dangers’ and inconveniences of the Free Zone.”</p>

                                    Don Emilio Velasco</hi>, <hi rend="italic">in the Mexican
                                    Congress, October</hi> 29 1870, <hi rend="italic">in favor of
                                    the maintenance of the Free Zone.</hi></p>
                            <p>Mr Velasco begins by noting that when, in 1881, the question of the
                                Free Zone was first discussed in Congress, it obtained 97 votes,
                                while in the later discussion of 1869 it received 112 votes. He
                                considers this fact as a happy augury for the result of the present
                                debate.</p>
                            <p>In allusion to the fact that Mr. Obregon, the representative for the
                                southern district of Tamaulipas, had delivered a speech in
                                opposition to the Free Zone, which might imply that the interest of
                                that state is not engaged in behalf of that measure, Mr. Velasco
                                replies that he is himself a native of Tampico, where his family now
                                reside, and that he has been the representative in Congress of the
                                southern district of Tamaulipas, with which all his interests are
                                identified, but that all smaller interests disappear in the presence
                                of a great national question like the present.</p>
                            <p>The argument which has been most insisted upon against the Free Zone
                                is that which alleges it to be a fruitful cause of contraband
                                traffic. In order to give its due weight to this assertion, we must
                                inquire, not whether such traffic now exists, but whether it has
                                increased or diminished by the establishment of the Zone.</p>
                            <p>After the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo the Americans founded
                                settlements along the Rio Grande, for the sole object of building up
                                a contraband trade with Mexico. Their system of bonded warehouses,
                                and the ease of procuring witnesses who should testify to the
                                exportation of goods across the frontier, rendered it easy for them
                                to defy the vigilance of our customs employés.</p>
                            <p>Official data, whose authority is unquestionable, prove how enormous
                                was the contraband trade from the United States, at that period. Mr.
                                Belden, a citizen of Brownsville, in a communication to the American
                                Secretary of the Treasury, testifies that before the law of the Zone
                                there used to be from one to three millions of goods constantly in
                                deposit at Brazos de Santiago and Brownsville; but that since then
                                commerce has so far ceased that the custom-houses at those places
                                are now a source of expense to the United States. All this
                                merchandise was destined to Mexico, for these frontier towns had no
                                commerce except with us, At the same time our custom-houses were not
                                paying expenses, which fact signifies that those millions of dollars
                                in merchandise were being constantly and fraudulently imported into
                                our territory.</p>
                            <p>From a report recently presented to the American Senate by one of its
                                committees the following paragraph may be quoted in proof of the
                                facts just stated: “It is impossible, says the report, “to prevent
                                smuggling upon a line like that of the Rio Grande, when there are
                                any inducements to it, and without doubt there was at this time
                                (before the Zone) much smuggling from the American side of the
                                river, to the detriment of the customs revenues and of the honest
                                commerce of Mexico.”</p>
                            <p>The Free Zone profoundly modified the mercantile situation of both
                                shores and interposed an obstacle to smuggling. The principle of the
                                Zone is that goods do not pay duties at the time of their
                                importation, but on their being dispatched to the interior of the
                                republic. The object of smuggling is to avoid payment of duties,
                                and, as there are none upon importations, all temptation has ceased.
                                The advantage of the American system of bonded warehouses is thus
                                neutralized, or rather a similar advantage is conferred upon all
                                points of the frontier, so that foreign goods no burner seek those
                                deposits, when they can, without expense, obtain storage in our own
                                principal <pb n="501" xml:id="pg_501" facs="0535"/>towns, which is
                                at once more convenient to the merchants and an important guarantee
                                for the collection of the duties should they be sent into the
                                interior.</p>
                            <p>“I have,” says Mr. Velasco, “in vain endeavored to discover how the
                                Free Zone can possibly be the cause of smuggling. In the discussion
                                of last year the honorable secretary of the treasury, in reply to an
                                inquiry of mine on this point, assured us that merchandise stored in
                                any of our towns within the Free Zone may be extracted from the
                                stores and sent in perfect liberty, without any interference from
                                the custom-house, and without any kind of certificates, throughout
                                the whole Zone. When the secretary-used this language he undoubtedly
                                had not studied the text of the law of the Free Zone. If he will
                                consult the fourth article of the law of March 17, 1858, he will
                                there find the regulations, which were carefully drawn up, expressly
                                to apply to the case of attempted frauds in the transportation of
                                goods to the interior, under pretext of carrying them to other
                                points of the zone.</p>
                            <p>“The citizen secretary of the treasury affirms that the passes and
                                other documents relating to the transportation of goods from one
                                point of the Free Zone to another are useless, because they are the
                                same that are issued from custom-houses in other ports of the
                                republic, and that in all ports alike they give occasion to frauds.
                                I must insist that this system of judging the frontier by the rest
                                of the country necessarily leads to great errors, and the secretary
                                has fallen into a very grave one on this subject. In other ports the
                                duties are paid on importation, but in the settlements of the Free
                                Zone they are paid on being sent into the interior. Consequently the
                                passes in the former case do not prove the payment of duties, while
                                the passes given in the ports of the Zone contain the
                                account-current of the duties, and therefore prove their payment.
                                The documents of the custom-houses on the frontier are not, then,
                                useless nor inefficacious, as the citizen secretary of the treasury
                                imagines. On the contrary, a contraband traffic on the frontier can
                                now only be effected by means of military seditions, or by the
                                connivance of the employés of the treasury.</p>
                            <p>“As an example of the relative advantages of the two systems in a
                                case of sedition, take that of Matamoras and Tampico, which both
                                revolted against the federal government in 1867. Duties at Matamoros
                                are paid on being sent into the interior. The passes given at that
                                port were not recognized as valid during the insurrection, and, as a
                                consequence, no interior commerce was permitted until the
                                restoration of order. On the contrary, at Tampico, although the port
                                was declared closed, this did not prevent heavy importations; and as
                                the duties are paid on landing, the treasury suffered immense
                                losses, since these importations left no trace behind. The Zone will
                                thus always be an obstacle to the mutinies or seditions which might
                                otherwise bestirred up for the purpose of protecting smuggling. As
                                the duties are to be paid elsewhere, it very little concerns the
                                treasury when a frontier town declares itself in rebellion.</p>
                            <p>“The Zone also renders much more difficult the contraband trade,
                                which rests on the connivance of the customs employés. Without the
                                Zone, when the goods were deposited in American warehouses, the
                                fraud could be planned and carried into effect in twenty-four hours.
                                Entire cargoes could thus be passed across the river in the shortest
                                space of time. Now, however, the difficulties are immensely greater
                                in effecting frauds with the connivance of employés through the more
                                complicated system of documents which must be provided.”</p>
                            <p>Mr. Velasco proceeds to show that the recent revival of contraband
                                traffic in some portions of the interior is owing to the suppression
                                of the internal custom-houses, which rendered it sufficient to
                                obtain the connivance of an officer of customs. The
                                counter-inspectors are designed to correct this evil. If, then,
                                there should at any custom-house of the frontier be committed any
                                frauds upon the quantity and quality of the goods dispatched from
                                the interior, it will be readily discovered by the
                                counterinspection.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Velasco proceeds to draw a picture of the low state of commerce
                                along the Mexican bank of the Rio Grande in 1858, and to contrast it
                                with its present prosperity, which he ascribes entirely to the Free
                                Zone. At the same time he points out the reverse condition of things
                                upon the American shore as a proof that the former wellbeing of
                                those towns was entirely owing to their having a monopoly of the
                                Mexican trade, which the Free Zone has but transferred to the other
                                side of the river, where it ought to be.</p>
                            <p>In reply to the proposition of the secretary of the treasury, who was
                                willing to concede ports of deposit in lieu of the Free Zone, Mr.
                                Velasco argues that as the Americans already possess them, and are
                                in a condition to derive greater advantages from them, through their
                                superior industry and enterprise, this concession would be entirely
                                insufficient to maintain a commercial equilibrium between the two
                                sides of the river, and the left bank would rapidly recover its
                                former preponderance. Consequently, in the name of the people whom
                                he represents, who are the inhabitants of the present Free Zone, Mr.
                                Velasco declares that if the Zone is to be abolished, his
                                constituents would regard the offer of ports of deposit as an insult
                                added to injury, and would prefer to suffer in silence rather than
                                be the object of a compassion very similar to irony.</p>
                            <p>After replying to various minor inaccuracies of the secretary of the
                                treasury, Mr. <pb n="502" xml:id="pg_502" facs="0536"/>Velasco
                                proceeds to consider the Free Zone as a vital necessity for the
                                frontier, and to show that it should be extended to the states of
                                Coahuila and Chihuahua, as was the intention when the plan was first
                                broached by the executive in 1852. He quotes at length from a
                                message of the executive of that time to show that the Zone was
                                considered to be but a just recompense to the people of the frontier
                                for the privations and dangers which they constantly incur in behalf
                                of the whole nation. He also shows the decadence of Paso del Norte
                                and other northern towns through lack of this privilege.</p>
                            <p>In conclusion Mr. Velasco says that free consumption is an
                                accomplished fact upon the frontier, for the reason that nature and
                                the necessities of the people have so required, and any attempt to
                                revoke this liberty might occasion the dismemberment of the
                                republic.</p>

                            in Central America, Mr. E. Corbet, of January 25th last, in answer to my

                            minister in San Salvador, of February 21st last, on the importance of
                            establishing a naval station of the United States on Tigre Island, Bay
                            of Fomeca.</p>
                        <p>5th. Inclosure E, my reply thereto, of February 26th last.</p>
                        <p>I will permit myself to submit a few remarks on the subject of these two
                            last notes. As you perceive from my answer to General Torbert, I do
                            fully agree with his view. I will not attempt to argue the strategical
                            and topographical side of the question. To do full justice to that, my
                            colleague is more competent authority than I; and besides, a mere glance
                            at the map, showing that in thé long-stretched and every day in
                            importance growing western coast of America south of San Francisco, our
                            country is destitute of even a good harbor of her own, let alone a naval
                            establishment or place of refuge, if only for cases of accidents or
                            disasters, will at once powerfully advocate General Torbert’s plan.
                            There is another consideration in its favor, namely, the fact that not
                            one of these Spanish North American republics, little Costa Rica
                            excepted, until now has been able to erect on their dangerous coasts a
                            single light-house. The pecuniary considerations entering into the
                            question, I must deem it out of my sphere. But there is an international
                            and political consideration eminently sustaining the plan. It cannot be
                            denied that these republics, however slowly, and impeded by their
                            political convulsions, are growing in commercial importance at a par
                            with the increasing commercial facilities between them and the marts of
                            the <pb n="503" xml:id="pg_503" facs="0537"/>world and the demand of the
                            civilized world for their valuable productions. This tends to give a

                                acknowledge the receipt of your letter, dated 28th ultimo, which
                                reached me by last mail, informing me of the steps you had taken to
                                procure redress from the government of Nicaragua for Mr. M. Glenton,
                                who had been compelled to contribute to a forced loan decreed by
                                that government, and I beg to thank you for the trouble you have
                                taken in his behalf.</p>
                            <p>As he has furnished me with no proofs of his nationality I cannot at
                                once address the government of Nicaragua in support of his claim. If

                                of her Majesty’s government, I shall at once demand the redress to
                                which he will be entitled.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: * * * * * * * Toward end of the month
                                of August last I received information that Captain Douglass, of the
                                Panama Railroad Company’s steamer Guatemala, had compromised the
                                neutrality of his company and of the flag under which its steamers
                                sail, by carrying for and delivering to the agents of the so-called
                                provisional government at Leon powder, lead, and caps. The
                                information was of such trustworthy character that I did not
                                hesitate, in vindication of my country’s flag and of the to me
                                well-known perfectly neutral intentions of said company, to report
                                the transaction to it. The company thereupon at once suspended
                                Captain Douglass from office. The instruction of the case, ordered
                                by the company, consumed some time, in part owing to the distances
                                and in part to the fact that it was difficult to procure witnesses.
                                On November 10th an inhabitant of this city made affidavit before me
                                on what he, August 15th and next days, witnessed in the Bay of La
                                Union and at Tempisque, which was communicated to the company. On
                                the strength of that affidavit and gome additional proof the
                                company, as I have been advised by a letter received the 25th
                                instant, has dismissed from its service not alone Captain Douglass,
                                but the purser of the steamer, Mr. E. Hansen, too. That letter
                                states that although the case of Captain Douglass was not an
                                entirely clear one, the company thought it well to make an example
                                of him. Inasmuch as on different occasions during revolutionary
                                movements within the Central American States, the good faith and
                                strict neutrality of the Panama Railroad Company has been doubted,
                                and even incriminations of the reverse have been advanced, I
                                consider it proper to advise your government of this its recent
                                action.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir: * * *</hi> I received the note with which
                                you addressed me under date of 29th ultimo, communicating to me that
                                toward end of last August, (here follows <pb n="504" xml:id="pg_504"
                                    facs="0538"/>a literal repetition of the contents of my note.) I
                                laid your dispatch before the President of the republic, and was
                                ordered to thank you for your good offices in the matter. The
                                conduct of Captain Douglas, who, from the fact that he entered into
                                independent contracts on new steamer lines, was considered to have
                                left the company’s service, had indeed caused surprise, not alone in
                                Nicaragua, but also in the neighboring republics, for his open
                                participation, by carrying elements of war to the rebels, who were
                                devastating the country. The government was engaged in collecting
                                all proofs in the case, with a view to remonstrate against the
                                conduct of the employés of the company, but the measure it has taken
                                in order to prove its neutrality dispenses the government from
                                taking further steps.</p>
                            <p>If, during the revolutionary movements in other republics, the good
                                faith and strict neutrality of the Panama Railroad Company has been
                                doubted, the government is ignorant of the causes. So far as regards
                                Nicaragua, the conduct of Captain Douglas furnishes cause for just
                                incriminations, which the company, by dismissing him from service,
                                has dispensed.</p>

                                the importance of having a naval station in the Bay of Fonseca, on
                                Tigre Island? We have no station between San Francisco and Panama,
                                and the place I name is the best harbor between the two places, and
                                convenient to all the republics; and for various natural reasons the
                                presence of one of our ships of war is constantly needed in Central
                                American waters. I think the best thing would be for the United
                                States to get possession or control of Tigre Island.</p>
                            <p>I have written to Baxter by this mail. I was in Gautemala last week
                                and had a talk with Mr. Hudson, and he will urge this point on the

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir: As</hi> by this time you will have received my
                            resignation as envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the
                            United States of America near the government of the republic of Peru, I
                            deem it to be my duty to lay before the Department of State a short
                            outline of my <pb n="505" xml:id="pg_505" facs="0539"/>services since
                            the 10th of October, 1865, and views in regard to the present political
                            and social condition of this republic, believing this to be necessary to
                            aid my successor, and to place within easy reach of the Department such
                            facts as may be of future service to our country.</p>
                        <p>Arriving in Lima, the capital of Peru, on the 20th of November, 1865, I
                            found the city in the midst of a revolution between the forces of
                            Vice-President Canseco and those of President Pezet. The dead were yet
                            lying in the plaza. Much gallantry was displayed by the assailing party
                            under Colonel Prado; Pezet’s forces were compelled to retire with
                            defeat, and Vice-President Canseco assumed the reins of government, with
                            wild demonstrations of passion against Spain.</p>
                        <p>On the 26th of the same month, about sixty officers met, and resolved to
                            appoint a dictator, and concentrating about two thousand persons in the
                            plaza, or public square, proclaimed Colonel Mariano Ignacio Prado
                            Dictator of Peru.</p>
                        <p>Under my instructions I awaited to “only recognize the constitutional
                            government” until the 22d of May, 1866, when I was presented with all
                            the courtesies due to a minister from the United States. This policy on
                            the part of our Government was wise, although, for the time being, it
                            retired me to the shades, and gave every other minister here a temporary
                            triumph over me.</p>
                        <p>Going behind the date above named, I must not omit an important
                            historical event, both for Peru and the cause of history, the 2d of May,
                            1866, “El Dos de Mayo,” when the great battle of Callao was fought. On
                            the 1st of May, after Mendez Nunez, the admiral of the Spanish fleet,
                            had announced his intention to bombard Callao, as he had done
                            Valparaiso, I was sent for by President Prado to meet him. He was
                            surrounded by his cabinet, Galvez, Pacheco, Prado, Quimper, Tejeda, and
                            by several of his staff, whose names I do not now remember. On entering
                            the room, the President approached me and said, “I have sent for you to
                            advise with you, not as a diplomat, but as one of the best friends of
                            America in our great emergency. What do you think of to-morrow?” I
                            replied that as an officer of my Government, that held friendly
                            relations with both Spain and Peru, I had no right to advise him. “But,”
                            said he, “tell me privately, as a friend, what are your opinions?” I
                            replied to him, and in this I may have done wrong, “If the fleet fight
                            you with vigor and in the proper manner, they ought to whip you in
                            fifteen minutes.” The President and the entire cabinet seemed surprised,
                            and desired to know my reasons. I replied, “The Spanish fleet can fire
                            ten guns to your one, and if they close upon you so as to effectually
                            use shell, grape, and canister, I believe they will silence all your
                            batteries, and destroy your town; your only hope is to make them fight
                            you at long range.”</p>
                        <p>Galvez, the secretary of war, took issue with me, and did not believe
                            that my views were correct. I said to him, “Very well, Mr. Secretary of
                            War, Peruvians may be able to meet ten guns with one, but my people,
                            though I have seen some little service, are not so firm and brave.”</p>
                        <p>The President then inquired what should be done. I repeated to him: “Make
                            them, if possible, fight you at long range, and then you are sure of
                            victory.” “But by what means?” “It is not for me to dictate or say, but
                            torpedoes are dangerous, and ships and sailors have a holy horror of
                            such infamous and profane implements of war.” That night, by some means,
                            forty barrels of powder, connecting by wires with an electrical battery
                            on shore, were sunk in the bay. The French, informed the Spanish fleet
                            of this fact, and before morning nearly every wire was cut. But the
                            battle came on, on the glorious “Dos de Mayo,” <pb n="506"
                                xml:id="pg_506" facs="0540"/>for so both Spain and Peru call it, and
                            the fleet bore bravely up toward the forts, reaching within
                            three-quarters of a mile. Then, as they were gallantly exchanging shots,
                            two torpedoes exploded and threw columns of water at least 150 feet in
                            the air. The whole Spanish fleet retired and fought at long range for
                            the remainder of the day. Such was the cause of the success or defeat
                            that followed this action, so glorious both to Peru and Spain. On the
                            part of Peru it will be a feast day forever, and on the part of Spain
                            the Duke of Callao claimed his title for this victory!</p>
                        <p>After the “Dos de Mayo,” Prado came into Lima as a conqueror, the streets
                            being strewn with flowers, and the populace actually kissing the hem of
                            his garments.</p>
                        <p>In October, 1866, Prado was duly elected President, with an over-whelming
                            majority of Congress in his favor. Several reforms were inaugurated by
                            him before his election, among which may be named the abolition of
                            pensions. This was a severe blow to the aristocracy of the country. The
                            families of the “old hidalgos” actually monopolized the revenues and
                            offices of the nation, and there was nothing left with which to support
                            the government. Nearly every white family, in some way or other, were
                            pensioned. Ex-officers, as well as those in service, drained the
                            revenues, so that the machinery of government was nearly paralyzed. At
                            these evils Prado struck, abolishing all hereditary pensions. He next
                            attempted to introduce a system of capitation taxation, which proved a
                            complete failure. Then one of his ministers, Quimper, sought to
                            interfere with the rights of the church, and the women and priests rose
                                <hi rend="italic">en masse</hi> against the decree. I have always
                            believed that Prado favored the greatest liberty, both civil and
                            religious, and have no doubt that this belief in the minds of others
                            hastened his downfall. The priests opposed him for this reason, and the
                            women followed the counsel of their father confessors.</p>
                        <p>The grand marshal, Don Ramon Castella, after having been wisely banished
                            from Lima by President Pezet; and sent on a trip to circumnavigate the
                            globe, returned from his long voyage in May 1866, and found Prado, his
                            protegé, in power. Still the “old man ambitious” could not rest where
                            others held higher positions, and, without the shadow of a cause, left
                            Lima for the south, raised the banner of rebellion, and died on the
                            wayside, with his saddle for a pillow—a singular character, full of many
                            virtues and some vices. Strange to say, Congress, then in session, voted
                            him all the honors of a grand marshal, a mausoleum, and granted to his
                            widow the same pension as if he had died in the defense of the
                            established institutions of his country. Who would not dare to be a
                            traitor with such liberal friends for enemies?</p>
                        <p>The republic, on my arrival, being disturbed by revolutionary movements
                            in every direction, the legations and consulates were crowded with
                            political offenders and disaffected persons seeking asylum. In December
                            1865, I addressed the Department, in my dispatch No. 4, on this subject,
                            and deprecated the practice, as being fraught with evil consequences to
                            the progress of order and to the future prosperity of this country. I
                            was opposed by every other diplomatic representative here in my
                            opinions, but at length triumphed over them all, and the government of
                            Peru, on the 20th of January, 1867, announced that asylum, as heretofore
                            practiced in Peru, should be forever abolished, thus placing herself
                            upon the broad basis of other civilized nations.</p>
                        <p>Subsequently, on the 27th of December, 1867, after Prado’s overthrow at
                            Arequipa, he came to this legation, claiming protection. I immediately
                            informed him that he should be safe from all illegal violence; <pb
                                n="507" xml:id="pg_507" facs="0541"/>but that if the courts of the
                            country should send a lawful command for his arrest, I could not, under
                            the rules established by himself in regard to asylum, give him any
                            further protection. On the morning of the 5th of January, 1868, 1 wrote
                            him a short note, urging him to go among his troops, make promises, and
                            appease the people, offering to ride with him if he would permit me. He
                            declined to expose me for his sake, but rode out with his aides. The
                            people attacked him with stones near the plaza, when he drew his sword,
                            and with his single arm drove them before him. After this he returned,
                            and with his family, numbering some eight or ten persons, came to the
                            legation, the mob yelling and following with wild demonstrations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Brent, the secretary of this legation; Lieutenant Commander C. W.
                            Tracy, of the United States Navy; my son, and Mr. Carpenter, then
                            secretary of the legation of the United States to Chili, were the only
                            men within the house, but we were all well armed with revolvers and
                            rifles, and momentarily awaited the attack. From the bay window I could
                            watch their approach, and they came within fifty yards of the door, with
                            cries of “Death to Prado.” At this juncture a gentleman of the name of
                            Bogardus rode among them, and by his influence and representations
                            caused them to desist and disperse.</p>
                        <p>Prado remained two days in the legation, and no demand was made for him.
                            On the third night he left in a coach secretly, protected by an officer
                            of the new government. Immediately after this, on the same day, General
                            Pedro Diez-Canseco assumed command in Lima as provisional chief of the
                            department of the center, and after remaining long enough in power to
                            make some large railroad contracts, which are said to have enriched him,
                            Colonel Balta succeeded him, and in May 1868, was duly elected President
                            of the republic of Peru. Balta is neither highly intellectual nor
                            cultivated, but seems to have great common sense and firmness. Many
                            efforts have been made to create revolutions against him, but his ready
                            eye, quick and firm hand have as yet never failed to crush them in the
                            bud. Many call him harsh, but I think he is not too harsh for the times
                            and his country. He is the only President that I have yet seen in Peru
                            on foot in the streets without guards, and he rides and walks without
                            any seeming fear of assassination. He is an enthusiast for internal
                            improvements, and since Prado was forced from power the following lines
                            of railroad have been established by law, and are now under
                            construction:</p>
                        <p>1st. From Mollendo to Arequipa, about 105 miles long, and now nearly
                            completed.</p>
                        <p>2d. From Callao to the pass of the Oroya, in the Andes, 150 miles long,
                            to connect the Pacific with the Peruvian headwaters of the river
                            Amazon.</p>
                        <p>3d. From Lima to Huacho, 100 miles in length, over nearly half of which
                            trains are now running.</p>
                        <p>4th. From Arequipa to the important town of Puno, on the borders of Peru
                            and Bolivia 150 miles long.</p>
                        <p>5th. From Lima to the agricultural and wine-growing district of Pisco,
                            110 miles long, now offered for contract.</p>
                        <p>The whole of these roads will cover nearly 615 miles, and cost about one
                            hundred and twenty millions of money. The greatest number of these works
                            are in the hands of an American, Mr. Henry Meiggs, who has displayed
                            great executive and financial ability. No American on this coast is more
                            popular, and he richly deserves the praise which is universally bestowed
                            upon him. He is certainly the most generous man in Peru, and few
                            Americans leave his doors in want. The greater part <pb n="508"
                                xml:id="pg_508" facs="0542"/>of the consideration for building said
                            roads has been paid to him in Peruvian bonds, which are now reported as
                            having been sold in Europe at 80 cents to the dollar. On this basis, if
                            all are sold, he may be entirely safe, but should a reverse, come upon
                            the market price before the negotiation is fully concluded he would be
                            greatly injured, as he has under his control about sixty or seventy
                            million dollars of the same.</p>
                        <p>In my opinion, it would be well that our people should not invest in
                            these bonds, for I sincerely believe the day of repudiation is not far
                            distant. The “Presupuerto General,” or budget for the Year 1869-’70,
                            will more fully show this fact.</p>

                        <p>This deficit in two years, besides a national debt of say about one
                            hundred millions more not named, and with this burden, the interest upon
                            the same, and keeping up said 615 miles of road by the government, where
                            will be the 22,361,550 sols, the annual income, as shown by the
                            budget?</p>
                        <p>There can be no doubt of the benefit these roads will confer upon the
                            country, but as all sections cannot be accommodated with their peculiar
                            lines of imaginary roads, and as these roads, owing to the sparse
                            population and small amount of freight, will never be able to pay for
                            the coal burned by the locomotives, the wear and tear, and annual
                            expense, the consequence must be that a strong anti-railroad party will
                            arise in Peru in less than five years hence. In fact, to run these roads
                            alone and pay the interest on her debts would cost the government her
                            whole revenue, and then who will pay for the expense of the government,
                            over twenty-two millions per annum? I make these arguments because I
                            desire that our countrymen may “stand from under.” I now predict that
                            before the adjournment of the present Congress the anti-railroad party
                            will be fully formed, and will probably control the future destiny of
                            Peru.</p>
                        <p>The population of Peru has been variously estimated at from three to four
                            millions. Of this number it would not be safe to say that one in twenty
                            are of the Caucasian race; civilized, probably eight hundred thousand,
                            the remainder being Indians, negroes, and mestizoes, who Pave nothing to
                            pay for the expenses of the government. Taxation is almost unknown,
                            except in the cities, where local taxes are levied to improve the same
                            and maintain the police.</p>
                        <p>Socially the higher classes in the cities are extremely agreeable, many
                            of them having been educated in Europe and the United States, and they
                            excel in the graces of the <hi rend="italic">salon</hi>, but the poor
                            are very poor and dependent, <pb n="509" xml:id="pg_509" facs="0543"
                            />and are reckless of the morrow. A stranger who enters the charmed
                            circle only would never know Peru.</p>
                        <p>There can be no doubt that all power is virtually in the hands of the
                            priesthood, and he who opposes them must fall. The army is the second
                            great power that may occasionally cause vibration on the surface, but it
                            soon subsides under the influence of the infallible church. It will be a
                            long time before a civilian holds high power in Peru.</p>
                        <p>The people of Peru look to the United States as their great example and
                            particular friend. This has been manifested on more than one occasion,
                            and the representatives of several great nations have come to me to aid
                            them in their just demands against this government. These requests were
                            not made because I personally could do more than themselves, but because
                            they were assured that the influence of our Government outweighed that
                            of all others with this republic. As evidence of this fact, the citizens
                            of the United States alone have received payment for injuries suffered
                            since 1863, and I must frankly say that in my judgment several of the
                            said claims ought not to have been paid. There is a certain class of our
                            people here who are chronic claimants and blackmailers, who bribe when
                            they can, and when they cannot bribe, abuse and lie about those who
                            oppose them. Several of them, it is said, “left their country for their
                            country’s good,” and their Peruvian studies have not improved their
                            morals. I have no doubt the records of the late mixed commission, which
                            I have not seen, will prove a part of this statement.</p>
                        <p>I have called Peru a republic. These words are too strong, but, as she so
                            styles herself, I have used the phrase. As I understand the word, there
                            are no republics in South America. In my opinion, the people do not
                            govern, constitution and laws do not control. The will of a few families
                            alone is the law. Still the shadow of freedom is exhibited on every
                            occasion to the public gaze, and the people cling to and adore it. I can
                            only hope that the shadow may, some day, become a substance, for in the
                            fullness of my heart my best wishes are for the future progress and
                            welfare of Peru.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, I regret to say that the future of Peru does not appear to
                            me in rainbow hues. The country can never become great in agriculture
                            for want of water. There is but little or no coal or fuel west of the
                            Andes to smelt her rich beds of minerals. The guano is nearly exhausted,
                            notwithstanding the marvelous stories told of the deposits on the main
                            land. This, in my opinion, has only been done for financial purposes. A
                            little common sense will convince the most skeptical that such deposits,
                            to any considerable extent, are merely imaginary, as the sea birds,
                            seals, and other marine animals that make and have made these vast
                            deposits in other ages, could and would not expose themselves to the
                            beasts of prey on the main land.</p>
                        <p>As I am now about to bid farewell to this genial climate and more genial
                            people, I only beg that our country will, on every proper occasion, do
                            all that can be done to advance the growth and future prosperity of
                            Peru.</p>
                        <p>Peru has unquestionably the finest navy on the western coast of South
                            America, and that fact alone, in my opinion, has compelled a peace with
                            some of her sister republics.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> On the morning of the 4th instant a
                            serious insurrection of the Chinese laborers or coolies took place on
                            the large cotton estates of Pativilca, about 180 miles north of Lima.
                            The Chinese, numbering nearly two thousand, committed every barbarity
                            possible; murdered nineteen whites and wounded forty. Troops were
                            immediately sent from Lima to the scene of the disturbance, and the
                            insurgents dispersed, flying to the mountains after having lost two
                            hundred in killed and wounded. The damage done to property is very
                            great, and so intense is the popular feeling that a resolution has been
                            introduced into Congress prohibiting the further importation of Chinese,
                            and expelling those already in the country. The bill has many warm
                            upholders. There can be no doubt that in some cases the Chinese are
                            treated with considerable severity, but on the estates which now have
                            been made the scene of their atrocities, the kindness of the masters
                            toward them was notorious.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> After having signed the treaties with Peru
                            (mentioned in my No. 232) dated the 6th and 12th instant, I deemed the
                            matter of sufficient importance, under my personal instructions, to send
                            the same to the Department of State by a bearer of dispatches.
                            Accordingly, on the 12th instant I appointed Colonel W. D. Farrand as
                            such bearer, it being necessary that he should leave Lima at 8 a.m. on
                            the 14th, so as to embark on the steamer for Panama. Some time after his
                            appointment, and when his passport, treaties, and dispatches were in his
                            hands, he informed me that a certain Abraham Wendell had caused legal
                            process to be issued against him, enjoining him from leaving the
                            country. Believing that the said order was entirely unjust, * * * * I
                            immediately addressed a note to his excellency, the minister of foreign
                            affairs, (inclosure No. 1,) informing him of the intended detention, and
                            requesting his excellency to take such steps as would prevent it, at the
                            same time citing to his excellency the doctrine contained in Wheaton’s
                            international law. His excellency, in very kind terms, declined my
                            request, taking issue with the writers on international law, upon the
                            subject, and making a distinction unknown to the law of nations. (See
                            inclosure No. 2, with translation.) Upon the reception of the same at
                            10.30 p. m. I replied to his excellency (inclosure No. 3) regretting the
                            difference of opinion that existed between us, and delivered the note to
                            the sub-secretary of state, (official mayor,) Dr. Elmore, who promised
                            to give me an answer before 8 o’clock the following morning, the time of
                            the departure of the train. At about 7.40 a. m. on that morning I
                            received a note from him (see inclosure No. 4) in which I was informed
                                <pb n="511" xml:id="pg_511" facs="0545"/>that the minister still
                            adhered to his former views, but said if I would go with the colonel to
                            the steamer he would have nothing to fear. With this authority, I
                            proceeded with Colonel Farrand on board the mail steamer, and after an
                            attempt to detain him, and some conversation with the captain of the
                            port, he was permitted to depart.</p>
                        <p>This matter may seem of but little importance to the Department, but * *
                            * * * * I think it proper to go one step further and inform the
                            Government of the nature of the claim.</p>
                        <p>In 1866, Farrand &amp; Co. procured a charter from the Prado government
                            here to construct a tram-way from Callao to Lima, and with the privilege
                            of running street railroads through Lima. Under this charter shares of
                            stock were issued, a few being given out gratuitously to persons who
                            favored the road. Five of these shares, by some manner, came into the
                            hands of Abraham Wendell. They never have had any marketable value in
                            Peru. The name of Farrand appears upon the certificates as president.
                            After the fall of Prado, at Arequipa, the charter granted to Farrand
                            &amp; Co. was declared void by the succeeding and present governments,
                            and hence the roads were never built. Upon these certificates of stock,
                            a wise court held Farrand personally liable for the full face of the
                            same, and without any security being given by his adversary, and only a
                            few hours notice, forbade him to leave the country as above stated. An
                            affidavit is already on file in the Department of State, affirming that
                            said stock was never of any marketable value. If necessary it would be
                            easy to prove by all the principal merchants of Lima that such is the
                            fact. * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>On the 17th I received another communication from his excellency
                            substantially reiterating his former positions, (inclosure No. 5.) To
                            this, on the same date, I replied, making a statement of all the facts,
                            citing authorities and making an argument against the position assumed
                            by his excellency, (inclosure No. 6.)</p>
                        <p>The Department will see by a perusal of my answer that under any and
                            every phase of the case Colonel Farrand was fully authorized to depart,
                            and that no just censure or liability can attach to this legation, or to
                            the United States.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> Colonel W. D. Farrand having been duly
                                appointed hearer of important dispatches and treaties from this
                                legation to the Department of State at Washington, informs me that
                                legal efforts are being made by certain persons to prevent his
                                embarkation on the steamer leaving Callao to-morrow for Panama, with
                                said dispatches and treaties. I need scarcely say to your excellency
                                that it is beyond the legal authority of any of the tribunals of
                                another country to hinder, delay, or arrest any member of a
                                legation, or any bearer of dispatches from the same. I respectfully
                                refer your excellency to chapter 1, part iii, of Wheaton’s Elements
                                of International Law, commencing at section 14 to 19, inclusive, the

                                government of Peru on his behalf as will prevent the Peruvian
                                authorities from violating the well-known international laws and
                                comity of nations.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Minister;</hi> I have had the honor of
                                receiving your excellency’s note dated to-day, informing me that
                                Colonel Farrand, who has been named the hearer of important treaties
                                and dispatches you sent to the Department of State at Washington,
                                has assured you that legal efforts are being made to prevent his
                                embarkation in the steamer that leaves to-morrow for Panama, with
                                the said treaties and dispatches.</p>
                            <p>Your excellency says that it is not necessary to remind me that no
                                tribunal can impede, delay, or arrest the bearer of dispatches from
                                a legation, and in proof of this is cited Wheaton’s International
                                Law, paragraph 19, chapter 1, part iii, and your excellency
                                concludes by requesting that the government will take such measures
                                as to prevent the Peruvian authorities from violating the well-known
                                laws of nations, and the comity between them.</p>
                            <p>I now have to reply to your excellency, deeply regretting that I am
                                obliged to differ from you in this matter. I believe, and your
                                excellency will agree with me, that the Peruvian government has
                                given to that of the United States very special proofs of friendship
                                and deference; nothing would be more agreeable for the government of
                                Peru than to accede to every desire of the government you so
                                worthily represent. On the other hand, nothing is further from the
                                intention of the government in whose behalf I have the honor to
                                speak than to infringe the principles of international law, and the
                                practice of those regulations of friendship that serve to preserve
                                harmony between countries. But justice has also its exigencies, and
                                the constitution and laws of a state claim a respect which your
                                excellency will be the first to acknowledge.</p>
                            <p>Whatever, according to the very distinguished American publicist,
                                Wheaton, and other noted writers, the privileges of bearers of
                                dispatches, I believe that your excellency will admit that there is
                                an essential difference between the one who is named directly by his
                                government and who cannot be molested afterward in any country while
                                fulfilling his errand, and the one who, being previously amenable to
                                the laws of the state where he resides and in which he has become in
                                a manner liable, receives a charge which, though granted with the
                                best intentions, cannot free him from his contracted obligations and
                                from the actions of the national laws.</p>
                            <p>I believe, Mr. Minister, that no writer of international law has
                                endeavored to establish judicial principles tending to abrogate the
                                laws of countries, and it therefore appears to me that the
                                distinguished Wheaton, speaking in the paragraph quoted, of the
                                immunities of cabinet messengers and bearers of dispatches, only
                                aimed to establish the privileges of an individual who arrives in a
                                foreign country, fulfilling a commission from his government, but
                                that it was not the intention of this or any other writer on the
                                subject to fix as an international law, that any person residing in
                                a foreign country may receive a commission, in virtue of which he is
                                made free from the jurisdiction of the country to which he had
                                previously been subject. The precedent that would be established by
                                such a principle is fatal to the institutions of any country, and
                                cannot therefore form a part of the great law of nations. Therefore,
                                for these reasons, I comply with my unpleasant duty in informing
                                your excellency that the government can do nothing in the manner you
                                desire, since the executive cannot interfere with the acts of the
                                judiciary, which indeed it must respect, and therefore, if Colonel
                                Farrand has been judicially notified of the order of detention, (the
                                only means by which he may be prevented from leaving the country
                                without fulfilling certain obligations,) it must be by reason of
                                legal proceedings, which it does not pertain to the government to
                                examine or reform, and to which your excellency, assured as I am, is
                                ready to render homage. Your excellency will not seek to render the
                                laws of Peru and the action of justice null through a commission
                                which might have been conferred upon any person.</p>
                            <p>Without examining the merits of any lawsuit that may exist against
                                Colonel Farrand, without considering whether such a lawsuit, if it
                                exists, is founded or not on justice, and acknowledging in the
                                fullest manner the good faith that has animated your excellency, not
                                only in this but in all your acts with my government during your
                                long residence in this country, I trust that your excellency will
                                appreciate the motives impelling me to this answer, as your
                                excellency must be convinced that the most vehement desire of the
                                Peruvian government is to gratify in every wish the Government of
                                the United States and its legation in Lima.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I had the honor of receiving your very
                                kind dispatch in reply to my note today. I deeply regret that I am
                                compelled to differ from the conclusions at which your excellency
                                has arrived. At the time of the appointment of Colonel Farrand as
                                hearer of dispatches, I knew nothing of any attempt to hinder or
                                prevent him from hearing the dispatches of this legation to my
                                Government at Washington, nor was such known to Colonel Farrand, nor
                                did any such cause exist at that time. Such being the case, I had
                                full power to appoint him, as I might have appointed any citizen of
                                Peru, the servant of my Government, and from the hour of that
                                appointment, the mantle of my Government covered him not only from
                                civil liability but from liability for crime within the jurisdiction
                                of Peru. The law of nations is too clear upon this point to need
                                citation. Unless governments are untrammeled in the selection of
                                their agents, haw, may I ask, would it be possible to send
                                dispatches when they might be detained by the government of the
                                country where the legation is established?</p>
                            <p>Far be it from me, on the eve of my departure from this hospitable
                                country, to throw the least obstacle in the pathway we have traveled
                                so harmoniously together, for in every act, aspiration, and wish of
                                my heart I have proved that I have been the true friend of Peru.</p>
                            <p>It is not the question as to who is to be the bearer of my
                                dispatches; that, personally is an unimportant matter; but it is not
                                unimportant that diplomatic privileges should be ignored.</p>
                            <p>Colonel Farrand is authorized to proceed to-morrow with his
                                dispatches to the United States. I judge not of the controversy
                                between himself and his contestants; I simply respectfully insist
                                upon my diplomatic rights, and the rights of the emyloyés of the
                                legation being respected and maintained, and shall with the greatest
                                kindness to your excellency’s country, follow this same course, and
                                would in Peru’s behalf defend the same principles to the last</p>
                            <p>I have the honor, &amp;c.,</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> Although it is notorious that Colonel
                                Farrand sailed for Panama in the steamer of the 14th instant, and
                                although this might be held as the conclusion of the discussion
                                opened by your excellency with this department on the subject, I am
                                obliged to answer the dispatch you sent me late on the night of the
                                13th, which was delivered to me by the official mayor, Dr. Elmore.
                                My silence on such an important matter might perhaps be considered
                                as an acceptation of the doctrines your excellency sustains, and
                                which cannot be accepted by my government without establishing a
                                precedent of the gravest consequences. I therefore proceed to answer
                                your excellency’s note, affirming my regret at not being able to
                                agree with your opinions on the subject.</p>
                            <pb n="514" xml:id="pg_514" facs="0548"/>
                            <p>It cannot be denied, and all writers on international law agree, that
                                hearers of dispatches should not be interfered with in the discharge
                                of their duties, and that their persons and the correspondence they
                                carry should enjoy certain immunities, without which their errand
                                could not be fulfilled. But it also cannot be denied that these
                                prerogatives do not so far extend as your excellency desired they
                                should in the case of Farrand, who, although named by you to convey
                                dispatches to Washington, had not entered upon the discharge of his
                                duty when he was informed on the 13th of the order of detention
                                issued by a judge of the first instance in Lima, and who, in
                                consequence of that order arising from acts of Farrand as a private
                                citizen, and subject from the same to the laws of Peru, could not
                                withdraw himself from Peruvian jurisdiction without casting a stain
                                on that respect merited by the tribunals of Peru, and without
                                violating the legal dispositions existing in regard to such
                                detention. Colonal Farrand could have rendered the order null by the
                                means established by the same laws, or by an arrangement with the
                                person detaining him, and then might readily have fulfilled the
                                charge your excellency intrusted him with, a charge which doubtless
                                would not have been confided to him had it been supposed that by
                                this means Farrand would escape the obligations he had contracted in
                                Peru and the respectable action of justice.</p>
                            <p>The celebrated Martens, so jealous of diplomatic immunities and
                                prerogatives, estabtablishes, in speaking of bearers of dispatches,
                                that their inviolability only is affected in the territory of the
                                state to which they are sent, or in the territory of the third power
                                through which they pass to reach their destination, since, if such
                                bearers of dispatches were detained in their voyage or in the state
                                where they carry their charge, a grave offense would be committed,
                                difficult to repair, and against a person discharging his delicate
                                commissions.</p>
                            <p>Martens, whose authority is greatly respected, says thus:</p>
                            <p>“Any violence committed against them (bearers of dispatches) is
                                considered as an atrocious violation of the law of nations, whether
                                it be committed in the territory of the state where the courier
                                carries his commission or in that of a third power through which he
                                may pass.”</p>
                            <p>The case is not stated of a courier being detained in the state from
                                which the dispatch is sent, but this omission on so important a
                                point is perfectly explained by the fact that there the bearer of
                                dispatches may be readily replaced by some other person named by the
                                same authority, without injury to the official service and without
                                allowing a concession of this nature to serve as a free pass for an
                                individual who, on account of civil or commercial responsibilities,
                                is impeded from abandoning the place of his residence, and without
                                causing the protecting shadow of the banner of a friendly country to
                                render such responsibilities of no effect, and nullify the action of
                                the judicial power in the exercise of its peculiar and high
                                attributions.</p>
                            <p>Your excellency’s penetration must admit the force of the reasons I
                                have adduced, and will surely admit that the action of my government
                                in the case, originating the present discussion, has been in perfect
                                conformity with the principles of international law and the
                                requirements of justice; and you will also admit that if an order of
                                arrest was issued against a Peruvian citizen in the United States,
                                the detention would be carried into effect, even if the person had
                                been intrusted by the minister of Peru with dispatches for his
                                government, which might easily be given to some other, who might
                                leave that republic with no difficulty whatever.</p>
                            <p>This question, arising from Colonel Farrand’s departure, has
                                terminated as a fact, but it is indispensable to clearly establish
                                the doctrine in regard to the immunities of bearers of dispatches,
                                so that it may never be alleged that the Peruvian government has
                                accepted that fact as in conformity with the code of the law of
                                nations, and that it may be clear that, far from this, it has
                                protested against that act, and does protest against it, in the
                                proper manner.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have had the honor of receiving your
                                excellency’s note, No. 44, in reply to my No. 29, dated the 13th
                                instant, and ! regret that any difference has arisen between us, <pb
                                    n="515" xml:id="pg_515" facs="0549"/>as I feel fully satisfied
                                that your excellency, as well as myself, would not knowingly
                                infringe any principle established by the law of nations. Before
                                proceeding to answer your excellency’s arguments in full, it becomes
                                my duty to reiterate a simple statement of the facts, so that just
                                deductions may be drawn from the same. The treaties between the
                                United States and Peru were signed, bearing date of the 6th and 12th
                                instant. I informed your excellency at an early hour on the 13th
                                that Colonel Farrand had been appointed bearer of dispatches by me.
                                His passport and dispatches were delivered to him on the 12th
                                instant. On the following day Colonel Farrand informed me that
                                certain legal proceedings would probably be instituted against him
                                for his detention in Peru. Thereupon I immediately addressed your
                                excellency, informing you of the facts and begging your excellency
                                to take such steps as would impede the Peruvian authorities from
                                interfering with his voyage to the United States. Your excellency
                                thought proper to decline my request, seeming to insist that the
                                laws of Peru were superior to and controlled the law of nations. Dr.
                                Elmore, the official mayor of the foreign office, brought this note
                                to me in person, at 9.30 p. m., on the same day. I then again
                                immediately addressed your excellency at 10.30 p. m., informing your
                                excellency that it would be necessary for Colonel Farrand to leave
                                on the morning of the 14th, at 8 o’clock, and still insisting upon
                                the positions which I had already assumed. On the departure of Dr.
                                Elmore from this legation, I was assured by him that I should have
                                an answer to the same in time for the train at 8 a. m. I received no
                                written answer from your excellency, but about 7.40 a. m. I received
                                a line from Dr. Elmore, dated September 14, 7.15 a. m., saying: “The
                                minister says he is sorry he can do nothing in the affair, and that
                                the colonel need fear nothing being with you.”</p>
                            <p>I regarded this statement from the official mayor as an easy mode
                                devised by your excellency to avoid the controversy between your
                                excellency and myself, not supposing for one moment that after this
                                semi-official announcement the least difficulty could take place, as
                                the personal arrest of a member of a legation, in the presence of
                                the minister, under such circumstances, could be regarded in no
                                other light than a direct insult to his government.</p>
                            <p>I will further state to your excellency, as I have heretofore in due
                                time stated, that at the time of delivering the passports and
                                dispatches into the hands of Colonel Farrand, neither he nor myself
                                had any knowledge of the intent to prevent his embarkation. I was
                                not a little surprised on arriving on board the steamer to find an
                                order for his detention before me. Giving, however, to the officer
                                representing the captain of the port, a copy of the above-cited
                                short note from the official mayor, Colonel Farrand was permitted to
                                depart. From the foregoing facts, I felt assured that the whole
                                matter had been indirectly prearranged by your excellency. Inasmuch,
                                however, as your excellency seems still to insist that the local
                                laws are superior to the law of nations, I deem it my duty to lay
                                before your excellency the views I entertained, together with a few
                                authorities upon this important question. Your excellency thinks
                                proper to state that some other person or persons might have been
                                chosen as bearers of dispatches. Your excellency will pardon me for
                                saying that while Peru has the right to select her officers, the
                                United States ought to be entitled to the same privilege.</p>
                            <p>It may or may not be politic, convenient, or possible to select this
                                or that person to fill such an important position as that of bearer
                                of dispatches. Extremes sometimes thoroughly test a principle. Let
                                us suppose a minister in court inimical to his country, and that
                                difficult and dangerous questions are to be settled. In such a case
                                (which happily does not exist between our respective governments) it
                                would then be within the power of the government where such minister
                                resided to prevent all communications or dispatches to or from the
                                government of such minister, unless the inviolability of the bearer
                                of dispatches is conceded.</p>
                            <p>Wheaton, in the Elements of International Law, sec. 14, says:</p>
                            <p>“From the moment a public minister enters the territory of. a state
                                to which he is sent, during the time of his residence, and until he
                                leaves the country, he is entitled to an exemption from the local
                                jurisdiction, both civil and criminal.”</p>
                            <p>Again, in section 19:</p>
                            <p>“The practice of nations has also extended the inviolability of
                                public ministers to the <hi rend="italic">messengers</hi> and <hi
                                    rend="italic">couriers</hi> sent with dispatches <hi
                                    rend="italic">to</hi> and <hi rend="italic">from</hi> the
                                legations established in different countries.”</p>
                            <p>Vattel, in the Law of Nations, p. 471, sec. 92, says:</p>
                            <p>“The law of nations, therefore, while it obliges us to grant
                                admission to foreign ministers, does also evidently oblige us to
                                receive those ministers in full possession of all the rights which
                                necessarily attach to their character all the privileges requisite
                                for the performance of their functions. It is easy to conceive that
                                    <hi rend="italic">independence</hi> must be one of those
                                privileges; since, without it, that security which is so necessary
                                to a public minister would be enjoyed on a very precarious tooting.
                                He might be <hi rend="italic">molested, persecuted,</hi> maltreated,
                                under a thousand pretenses.”</p>
                            <pb n="516" xml:id="pg_516" facs="0550"/>
                            <p>Again, sec. 143:</p>
                            <p>“Couriers <hi rend="italic">sent or received</hi> by an <hi
                                    rend="italic">embassador,</hi> his papers, letters, dispatches,
                                all essentially belong to the embassy, and are consequently to be
                                held sacred; since, if they were not respected, the legitimate
                                object of the embassy could not be attained, nor would the
                                embassador be able to discharge his functions with the necessary
                                degree of security.”</p>
                            <p>The following authorities bear upon and support the same doctrine:
                                Woolsey, International Law, sec. 92; Martens, Guide Diplomatique,
                                sec. 26; Kuber, Droit de Gens, sec. 190; Heffter, International Law,
                                sec. 204; Horne on Diplomacy, sec. 37.</p>
                            <p>Your excellency, in your No. 43, mates a distinction between bearers
                                of dispatches who come into the country and those who may reside
                                therein. Surely the authorities all agree that an envoy
                                extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary has the power to clothe
                                the messenger with inviolability as amply and fully as the sovereign
                                of the court from which he is accredited. I will be pardoned for
                                saying that your excellency will have great difficulty in finding a
                                precedent or authority in any respectable work on international law
                                for the positions your excellency has assumed. Your excellency’s
                                argument from the omission of Baron Martens, in not mentioning
                                couriers going out of a country, is fully met and answered by the
                                words from Wheaton and Vattel, above quoted, “Couriers sent to or
                                    <hi rend="italic">from</hi> the legations;” “Couriers received
                                or <hi rend="italic">sent</hi> by an embassador,” &amp;c.; and
                                Martens himself, quoted by your excellency, says: “Couriers are
                                messengers sent by sovereigns, governments, or ministers, and that
                                all violence committed upon them is an atrocious violation.” (Sec.
                                250, Précis Droit de Gens.)</p>
                            <p>May I ask your excellency how a courier could be <hi rend="italic"
                                    >sent</hi> from the legation, or couriers received or <hi
                                    rend="italic">sent</hi> by an embassador, or <hi rend="italic"
                                    >sent</hi> by a minister, without going out of the country where
                                the minister resides appointing him? This seems to me, in all
                                courtesy, a full answer to your excellency’s argument on this point,
                                as your excellency admits the inviolability in all other cases, and
                                only controverts the great authors of international law as to
                                couriers going out. When Wheaton says his person is <hi
                                    rend="italic">inviolate,</hi> and Vattel that his person is <hi
                                    rend="italic">sacred,</hi> and Martens that all violence
                                committed upon his person is an atrocious violation of the law of
                                nations. Let me ask again, if couriers could be stopped on account
                                of local obligations, might not the labors of such ministers prove
                                abortive? For the courier, like the minister, in the language of
                                Vattel, above cited, “might be <hi rend="italic">molested,
                                    persecuted, maltreated,</hi> under a thousand pretenses.” I have
                                strong reason to believe that the action brought against Colonel
                                Farrand, which has caused the present correspondence, falls within
                                the spirit of the above quotation. The law of nations, so to speak,
                                is the constitution of the civilized nations of the world, and is
                                above all local laws and enactments.</p>
                            <p>The laws of Prussia made the personal property of a person who was
                                the tenant of another subject for the payment of the rent, but the
                                question arose, “not what are the rights conferred by the laws of
                                the country upon the proprietor in respect to the tenant who is a
                                subject of that country; but what are those rights in regard to a
                                foreign minister whose dwelling is a sacred asylum, whose person and
                                property are entirely exempt from the local jurisdiction, and who
                                can only be compelled to perform his <hi rend="italic"
                                    >contracts</hi> by an appeal to his <hi rend="italic">own</hi>
                                government.” (Wheaton, sec. 17.) In this case it was decided that
                                the embassador’s personal goods could not be seized. Bearers of
                                dispatches are above declared to have the same inviolable rights.
                                Nations enforce their diplomatic rights against the local
                                authorities. Vattel. says:</p>
                            <p>“Rincin and Fregose, sent by Francisco I, as embassadors, were
                                stopped on the river Po, and murdered by the governor of Milan. As
                                the Emperor, Charles V, seemed to favor it, Francis had a just cause
                                for declaring war against him, and even calling for the assistance
                                of other nations * * * * Such an affair is a quarrel which involves
                                the concern of. all nations.” (Sec. 84.)</p>
                            <p>I cite these authorities to show that nations cannot set up their
                                local laws against the principles established by international law,
                                either civil or criminal. I submit that the quotation from Martens,
                                made by your excellency, is in strict accordance with the above
                                authorities. Your excellency seems to be anxious to make an excuse
                                that Martens has not gone further on your side to sustain your
                                positions, but the first part of the section to which your
                                excellency refers clearly shows that he denies the position assumed
                                by your excellency.</p>
                            <p>The local courts, when the bearer of dispatches is duly appointed,
                                cannot touch his person for civil or criminal liabilities, except
                                perhaps for treason or treasonable conduct. The responsibility alone
                                rests, in my opinion, with the government of the minister sending
                                the messenger. If this position is correct, the just claim of any
                                person here against Colonel Farrand cannot be jeopardized.</p>
                            <p>The extremely friendly relations that have existed since my arrival
                                in Peru between our respective governments augment my feelings of
                                regret that we should be compelled to differ, even on technical
                                points; but I feel assured that the same harmony and fraternal
                                feeling will exist whether I am or your excellency is in the error.
                                As this affair has caused some little excitement within the capital,
                                and as I have no right <pb n="517" xml:id="pg_517" facs="0551"/>to
                                make the correspondence relating to it public under the rules of my
                                government, I conceive that your excellency would be doing full
                                justice to all concerned; as you have the power, in publishing the
                                entire correspondence.</p>
                            <p>I beg to reassure your excellency of my most distinguished
                                consideration.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I regret having to commence my
                                official intercourse with you in referring to an affair which has
                                taken an unpleasant character, and in which the doctrine sustained
                                by your legation cannot be admitted by my government without
                                establishing precedents of very important consequences. It is
                                understood that I refer to the departure of the American citizen,
                                Mr. W. D. Farrand, violating the judicial orders of detention issued
                                against him, at the request of persons to whom he was under certain
                                responsibilities. Since the violation of these orders, issued in
                                conformity with Peruvian laws and by competent authority, was an
                                accomplished fact, and since the government of Peru could not be
                                silent on such an important point, without admitting the theory
                                sustained by General Hovey, it was found necessary to address to
                                this high functionary the note of protest, with which you are
                                perfectly conversant. I thought that this would terminate the
                                discussion initiated by the American minister, in which this
                                department has sustained, and does sustain, that the appointment of
                                a person as bearer of dispatches is not sufficient to withdraw him
                                from the jurisdiction of the tribunals of the country where he has
                                resided as a private individual, and as such entered into various
                                undertakings of a business character; but, nevertheless, the general
                                addressed me the note which I received on the 19th instant a few
                                hours before he made his official farewell. I find it indispensable
                                to take notice of that dispatch regarding the matter under its true
                                merits, and placing the question of international right in its
                                correct limits, proving thus again that my government has, in this
                                disagreeable affair, observed the proper circumspection, and has
                                adhered perfectly to the principles of the great law of nations.</p>
                            <p>Following the plan established by his excellency General Hovey, I
                                will first remark the facts preceding the departure of Colonel
                                Farrand, to afterward enter into the question of the privileges of
                                bearers of dispatches.</p>
                            <p>When, by the first dispatch of his excellency on the 13th instant, I
                                learned of the appointment of Colonel Farrand as bearer of
                                dispatches to Washington, and of the existance of certain orders of
                                detention against him, I was pained at not being able to accede to
                                the request contained in that dispatch, that Farrand might not be
                                impeded from leaving in the steamer sailing for Panama on the next
                                morning 5 since it was impossible to establish an unjustifiable
                                exception, and violate the laws to which the person detained was
                                liable, the government thus contributing to weaken the respectable
                                orders of the judicial power, and causing the interested parties in
                                the detention to lose their rights by a gubernatorial act, at once
                                illegal and unjustifiable.</p>
                            <p>Such were the considerations that governed me in replying to General
                                Hovey on the same day, a reply which was delivered to him by Dr.
                                Elmore, the chief clerk of this <pb n="518" xml:id="pg_518"
                                    facs="0552"/>department, who likewise brought to me at 12
                                o’clock on the same night the answer of the American legation.
                                Without awaiting the result of the discussion, his excellency
                                General Hovey departed for Callao in the first train on the morning
                                of the 14th, and going on board the steamer Peru, the scene with
                                which you are acquainted took place. It is said that the letter of
                                the official mayor, transcribed in his excellency’s dispatch which I
                                now reply to, was considered as an easy method devised by me to
                                avoid the controversy, and that it was not supposed after this
                                semi-official announcement that any difficulty would occur.</p>
                            <p>I must be permitted to recall to your honor that when a diplomatic
                                discussion is being carried on in writing, it cannot be considered
                                as terminated by private notes, not even bearing the signatures of
                                the debating ministers, but only that of an employé of the
                                department of the chief clerk; especially as the said employé did
                                not state in his letter that the note was by the order or the
                                request of the minister. On the other hand, from the tenor of this
                                document, to which an importance is given it that is not merited, it
                                appears that the minister who now addresses you insisted in denying
                                the request, and this must be noted, since this department cannot
                                refuse the request of the minister of a friendly power, to afterward
                                concede it in an anti-diplomatic and indecorous manner. Since the
                                minister of foreign affairs cannot and does not accept the
                                responsibility of the acts of others, this point may be considered
                                as fixed. But since the legation has given such importance to this
                                letter, the same must be allowed to a document of the same nature,
                                addressed to me by the official mayor on the same night, thinking he
                                might not find me, and which he delivered to me in my house. In this
                                he says: “The general accompanies Farrand to Callao to-morrow, and
                                says that a very grave international question will take place if the
                                authorities of Peru detain, in such circumstances, an officer of the
                                United States.”</p>
                            <p>It therefore appears that the decision of his excellency to accompany
                                Farrand was not the result of the letter from the official mayor,
                                but had been formed from the morning of the 13th. This cannot be
                                denied, unless it is agreed that the private letters of which I have
                                spoken have not the semi-official character, which, if given to the
                                first, must also be conceded to the last.</p>
                            <p>A number of quotations are made in the dispatch, which I have the
                                honor of answering from noted writers, respecting the immunities,
                                inviolability of the person and dispatches and papers of the
                                messenger. These are hardly to the point, since I do not pretend to
                                sustain that messengers while in the country to which they are sent,
                                or in a third nation through which they must pass, can be detained.
                                The present question is of a distinct character. It is whether an
                                individual domiciled in a country in which as a private citizen he
                                has made business transactions and contracted certain
                                responsibilities can escape these by being named bearer of
                                dispatches by a diplomatic agent. The question now fairly put is not
                                sustainable by the theory invoked in favor of Farrand, and certainly
                                no authority will be found to assert the immunity of the messenger
                                simply from having received that, character, and against whom,
                                before his entrance upon his duty, the orders of arrest were issued.
                                It cannot be otherwise, since, if the doctrine upheld by the
                                legation of the United States is admitted, it follows by clear logic
                                that a diplomatic agent naming as messenger some person against whom
                                legal writs were pending, or who from certain responsibilities was
                                prohibited from leaving the country where they were contracted, was
                                authorized to protect with his flag such a person even if before his
                                entrance on duty the grave impediment against the messenger was
                                known. Your honor will agree with me that such a theory, absurd and
                                wholly untenable, and even supposing, as it must be supposed, that
                                at the time of naming the messenger the minister was unaware of the
                                obstacles existing, once cognizant of them the person should be left
                                to justice, and another person named to discharge the commission,
                                thus reconciling the exigencies of the diplomatic service with those
                                not less to be respected, of the due administration of justice.</p>
                            <p>I have been very far from affirming in any of my communications that
                                a messenger sent by a legation, an embassador, or a minister, should
                                not leave the state from which he carries the dispatches. I have
                                affirmed, calling upon the authority of Baron Martens, that the
                                messenger is inviolable in the state to which he is sent, or in the
                                territory of a third, through which he may pass to perform his duty,
                                and that Martens, in not stating the case of the messenger being
                                detained in the territory from which he is sent, clearly insinuates
                                that the messenger may be there detained, if there are motives for
                                so doing, since it is easy to replace him; since his
                                responsibilities should not be ignored, contracted in the place of
                                his residence, and since establishing a contrary theory, diplomatic
                                agents would have the additional privilege of withdrawing from the
                                courts of the country where they are accredited, any person subject
                                to civil or criminal responsibilities, only by alleging the person
                                was being sent as bearer of important dispatches. This necessary
                                rectification made, the argument referred to is destroyed.</p>
                            <p>But even supposing that the Baron de Martens had made no distinction
                                in this matter, it would always be impossible to sustain that a
                                commission as bearer of dispatches would free a person from the
                                action of the courts of the country where he resides, and <pb
                                    n="519" xml:id="pg_519" facs="0553"/>from the liabilities he had
                                there contracted. Bearers of dispatches cannot pretend to the same
                                immunities as the higher members of the diplomatic corps; and if the
                                Baron de Werch, plenipotentiary of the Landgrave of Hesse Cassel in
                                France, was detained in Paris because he had not paid his creditors,
                                and was not allowed to leave that capital until the Landgrave had
                                assumed the responsibility of his debts, what would take place with
                                respect to persons not having such rank in the diplomatic family?
                                The question needs no reply.</p>
                            <p>The difference of opinion on the point in discussion does not alter
                                the good understanding between the two governments, nor the harmony
                                and personal consideration between the two ministers who have been
                                engaged in the question, which I think is now concluded.</p>
                            <p>I must observe to your honor that in mentioning the delay in
                                receiving the note I have just answered, it was only to fix that
                                delay on record, and not to give the matter any undeserved
                                importance.</p>
                            <p>I beg to assure your honor of my highest consideration.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> The question which arose between General
                            Hovey and the minister for foreign affairs of Peru, relative to the
                            right of that government to obstruct the departure of Colonel Farrand,
                            who had been appointed a bearer of dispatches by the general, seems to
                            be of too much general importance to be left unnoticed by this
                            Department. It is of no moment in the particular case, as the Peruvian
                            government ultimately connived at Colonel Farrand’s departure.</p>
                        <p>The occasion for the colonel’s employment in the character adverted to
                            was the conclusion of two treaties between the United States and Peru,
                            which were signed on the 6th and 12th of last month. General Hovey’s
                            instructions recognized his right to make such an appointment in such a
                            contingency. The appointment was made accordingly on the 12th of
                            September, and Colonel Farrand’s passport in his official character
                            issued to him on that day without any information to General Hovey that
                            any branch of the Peruvian government or any person objected to the
                            colonel’s discharging the duties of his trust. It seems, however, that
                            subsequently, but before the colonel could start on his errand, a person
                            claiming to be a creditor of his sued out judicial process forbidding
                            him to leave Peru. General Hovey promptly complained of this proceeding
                            as contrary to international law relative to the immunities of couriers,
                            as set forth in Wheaton’s treatise on that subject. The minister, in his
                            reply, while acknowledging the authority of Wheaton, endeavors to
                            restrict the privilege of couriers as there declared to those appointed
                            by a government to its legations abroad, and enlarges upon the
                            inconveniences which the more extensive enjoyment of such immunities
                            would lead to. It is true that no abuse of the privilege in this case is
                            alleged, but its existence is impliedly, at least, denied. This denial,
                            however, has no support from Wheaton, or from any other writer on that
                            branch of public law. If the Peruvian minister supposed that he had any
                            reason to hesitate in acknowledging the unqualified character of the
                            rule laid down by Wheaton, the plain and unequivocal terms in which
                            Calvo speaks upon this point may be enough to remove <pb n="520"
                                xml:id="pg_520" facs="0554"/>any such hesitation. The work of this
                            author on international law was published in Spanish at Paris, in 1868.
                            It is remarkable as embracing everything illustrative of the subject up
                            to the time of its publication, and its clearness and precision are at
                            least equal to its fullness. At paragraph 240, on page 350 of the first
                            volume, may be found the words of which the following is a
                            translation:</p>
                        <p>The inviolability which public ministers enjoy has also been extended to
                            the messengers and couriers of the embassies and to those who proceed to
                            them with official dispatches, and as a general rule to all who
                            discharge, as cases may arise, any commission for those embassies.</p>
                        <p>This, it seems, should be conclusive of the question. If General Hovey
                            had been aware that Colonel Farrand was justly liable to arrest, and had
                            willfully appointed him a bearer of dispatches to screen him therefrom,
                            this would have been sufficient cause of complaint on the part of the
                            Peruvian government, and perhaps of censure of its minister by this
                            Government. Even this knowledge on the part of the general, however,
                            would not, it is conceived, have impaired the immunity of his courier
                            under the public law. If alleged delinquencies or pretended claims are
                            trumped up against persons appointed or about to be appointed couriers
                            in foreign countries to prevent them from starting, the immunity
                            guaranteed to them by public law may at any time be annihilated by an
                            envious or malicious person. This is a result to be deplored and guarded
                            against by all governments, by the government of Peru as well as by the
                            Government of the United States.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have the honor to inform you that his
                            Majesty the Emperor, sanctioning the report of the Holy Synod, has seen
                            fit to appoint the Archimandrite John archbishop of the Aleutian Isles
                            and of Alaska. He was formally nominated on Wednesday last, and was
                            consecrated <pb n="521" xml:id="pg_521" facs="0555"/>to-day. The diocese
                            of this new bishop includes the whole of the United States, but it is
                            not yet decided whether he will have his residence in New York, San
                            Francisco, or New Archangelsk. His salary is three thousand rubles, paid
                            by the imperial government. The bishop himself is only thirty-two years
                            old, and has been but eight years in orders, but is highly spoken of for
                            learning and character. As this is, I believe, the first instance where
                            a foreign sovereign (the Pope excepted) has sent a functionary of this
                            kind to the United States, and certainly the first where the functionary
                            receives his pay from the treasury of a foreign power, I have thought it
                            necessary to call your attention to this fact.</p>
                        <p>I may add that a few weeks ago a Mr. Nicolas Behring, formerly a Catholic
                            professor of Baltimore, came to St. Petersburg and embraced the Russian
                            orthodox religion. He was at once ordained a priest for service in
                            America, the rite being performed in the German language.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inclose you an
                                abstract of the law regulating cities, the latest of the great
                                reforms of the present reign. The constitution of the Russian
                                cities, now in force, was adopted by Catherine II, and continued
                                almost unchanged until 1866, when charters similar in spirit, though
                                less liberal than this new law, were granted to St. Petersburg,
                                Moscow, and Odessa. These reforms were found to work so well, that a
                                special commission was charged with the duty of elaborating a
                                general law for all the cities of the empire. This commission was at
                                work for more than a year, making public from time to time its
                                proceedings and propositions, which were ably discussed in the
                                leading journals. The project of the commission was adopted, with
                                slight alterations, by the council of the empire, and is now
                                sanctioned by the Emperor.</p>
                            <p>By an imperial ukase of the 28th of June, published on the 4th of
                                August, this reform has been ordered to be introduced into all the
                                cities of European Russia, except St. Petersburg, Moscow, and
                                Odessa; and the cities of Poland, Bessarabia, (except Kishinef,) and
                                the Baltic provinces. The first three, owing to their exceptional
                                position, are left as they are for the present, and their city
                                councils are given six months to show what changes may be needed for
                                them. After consultation with the authorities of the western and
                                Baltic provinces, special laws will be made suited to the needs of
                                those regions. The abolition of the old German and Swedish charters
                                in the cities of the Baltic provinces will probably be attended by
                                some difficulty.</p>
                            <p>The reform seems conceived in a very liberal spirit, with the aim of
                                decentralizing as much as possible, and of accustoming the people to
                                representative institutions. The peculiar mode of protecting the
                                property-owning classes in the election of the city councils is an
                                interesting experiment in municipal government. The lowest class in
                                the cities of Russia, composed of artisans and laborers, is
                                constantly changing; and other things being equal, it would be found
                                very difficult to arrange for their voting. The restriction as to
                                the number of non-Christians in the city governments seems a blot in
                                an otherwise liberal measure, and it has been remarked as such by
                                some of the journals.</p>

                            <p>The municipal administration has the care of the economical interests
                                of the city and of the maintenance of good order. The chief objects
                                of administration are: 1, the organization of their administration
                                and of the city economy; 2, the external constitution of the city,
                                streets, parks, buildings, &amp;c.; 3, matters regarding the
                                well-being of the inhabitants, markets, public health, precautions
                                against fire, &amp;c., protection of commerce and industry, docks,
                                exchanges, and establishments of credit: 4, hospitals, theaters,
                                museums, and libraries; 5, public instruction; 6, communication to
                                the government of the wants and interests of the city. The
                                administration is limited in jurisdiction to the extent of the city,
                                and can impose no taxes not authorized by law, and is responsible
                                for all excess of power and illegal acts. Complaints and conflicts
                                of jurisdiction are referred to a special provincial assembly in
                                each government, composed of the governor, the vice-governor, the
                                treasurer, the procurer of the court of assizes, the president of
                                the general session of justices of the peace, the president of the
                                government provincial diet, and the mayor of the chief town of the
                                government. In case the municipal administration does not pay the
                                taxes to the general government which have been lawfully imposed,
                                the governor will collect them at the expense of the city.</p>
                            <p>The institutions for the municipal administration are: 1, the city
                                electoral assemblies; 2, the city council; and, 3, the city
                                government or delegation. The electoral assemblies meet once in four
                                years to elect the members of the city council. Every inhabitant of
                                the city can vote, provided he is a Russian subject, twenty-five
                                years old, and owns real estate in the city paying taxes, or keeps
                                an establishment of commerce or manufactures with a commercial
                                certificate, or if he has lived in the city for two years before the
                                election and pays taxes on a certificate for commerce or
                                manufactures for retail trade, or as a clerk of the 1st class; and
                                if he owes no arrears of taxes. Electors are not allowed to vote if
                                they have been condemned or are under trial for crimes or
                                misdemeanors, if they have been expelled the public service, (within
                                three years,) if they are bankrupt, (unless their innocence has been
                                proved,) if they have been expelled from the clerical state for
                                vices, or if they have been expelled from the nobility or the
                                guilds. The governor, the members of the provincial assembly for
                                municpal affairs, (except the mayor,) the members of the government
                                regency, and the local police cannot vote while in office. Females,
                                absent persons, and those between twenty-one and twenty-five can
                                appoint an electer to vote for them by power of attorney. Infants
                                are to be represented by their guardians. Institutions, companies,
                                corporations, churches, and monasteries which own taxable real
                                estate, or pay taxes on rights for trade or manufactures, have the
                                right to vote through their president or representative. But no one
                                can have more than two votes—one for himself, and one as attorney
                                for another.</p>
                            <p>The electors are divided into three electoral assemblies, each of
                                which elects one-third of the members of the city council. Each of
                                these three electoral assemblies is composed of persons paying
                                one-third of the taxes: the first assembly being made up of those
                                who pay the highest taxes, up to one-third; the second, those coming
                                next; and the third, all the rest of the electors.</p>
                            <p>Every elector is elegible to the city council, but not more than
                                one-third of the council can be non-Christians. The voting is by
                                secret ballot. A candidate is elected when he has a majority of
                                votes, provided he receives more than half the number of votes cast.
                                A person elected can refuse to serve. There is a quorum in the
                                electoral assembly when the number of voters surpass the number of
                                members to be elected. The city council is composed of members
                                elected for four years, presided over by the mayor. When the number
                                of electors does not exceed 300, there are 30 members of the
                                council; for every 100 electors in excess of 300, six members are
                                added to the council until 72, which is its limit The members of the
                                city government sit in the council, but have no votes unless
                                members. The council elects the city officers; fixes their salaries;
                                fixes the amount of taxes; has the charge of converting all personal
                                services due to the city to money ones, <hi rend="italic">e.
                                    g.,</hi> paving and cleaning the streets, hitherto done by the

                                the budget; revision of accounts and of the operations of the
                                executive; the elaboration of rules for the administration of the
                                city property and public buildings; and the establishment of
                                beneficence and public utility in their charge; the general order of
                                the labors of the executive; the regulation of public utility, <hi

                                the wants and needs of the city to the supreme authority.</p>
                            <p>The city council examines affairs in its competence on the initiative
                                of the mayor or of its members, on the proposition of the city
                                government, on the initiation or demand of the govermental
                                authorities, and on the demand or complaint of private persons.</p>
                            <p>One-third of the members of the council form a quorum, except when
                                there is a discussion about the purchase or sale of real estate by
                                the city, loans or guarantees, the conversion of contributions in
                                kind with money, and the impeachment and removal of officials, when
                                half the members must be present, and a majority of two-thirds is
                                necessary to pass a measure. In other cases a simple majority is

                            <p>The council will elect those special officers and representatives now
                                appointed by the city, such as directors of city banks, of city
                                benevolent institutions, &amp;c.</p>
                            <p>The city government or delegation is composed of a number of members
                                fixed by the city council, but not less than two besides the
                                president who is the mayor.</p>
                            <p>In the small cities the duties of this delegation can be intrusted to
                                the mayor alone. This institution has charge of the immediate
                                carrying on of the economical, commercial, and administrative
                                affairs of the city. On its proposition the city council can
                                establish executive commissioners, permanent or temporary, to take
                                measures necessitated by extraordinary circumstances and for the
                                immediate direction of certain branches of the economy and
                                administration; a branch of administration can also be intrusted to
                                a single individual. These commissions are presided over by one of
                                the members of the delegation. The delegation also performs all
                                those duties formerly imposed on the city council by the superior
                                authorities, such as the collection of the taxes of the empire, the
                                drawing recruits, &amp;c. The mayor of the city, the members of the
                                delegation, and the secretary of the city are selected by the city
                                council, and substitutes are also elected to take their places in
                                case they cease their functions. The members of the delegation must
                                be electors, but not necessarily members of the council; the
                                secretary need not be an elector, provided he is not absolutely
                                disqualified. There cannot be in the delegation at the same time
                                father and son, father-in-law and son-in-law, or brothers; nor more
                                than one-third can be non-Christians. The mayor cannot be a Hebrew.
                                There cannot be in the city service as mayor, member of the council
                                or delegation, <hi rend="italic">i. e.,</hi> an ecclesiastic, a
                                judge, a procurer or assistant procurer, or a functionary of the
                                public treasury. Officials in the service of the state can only
                                accept service in the city government and retain their places with
                                the consent of their chiefs. The mayor is elected for four years;
                                the members of the city delegation are renewed half every two years
                                and can be reëlected. The term of office of the secretary depends on
                                the council. The election of mayor of a government city must be
                                confirmed by the minister of the interior; of the other cities, by
                                the governor. The other officers need no confirmation. The extent of
                                the powers of the city government with regard to good order and the
                                public welfare is clearly defined.</p>
                            <p>The kind of property which can be owned, bought, or sold by the city
                                is distinctly specified, as well as the manner of its purchase or
                                sale.</p>
                            <p>The city council can lay taxes: 1, on real property, by per cent.; 2,
                                on patents for trade and manufactures; and, 3, on hotels and
                                restaurants; also, 4, on cartage, hacks, and transportation; 5, on
                                horses and vehicles kept by private persons; and, 6, on dogs, but
                                for these last the highest rate of tax and the method of collection
                                must be regulated by a special law of the empire. The tax on real
                                estate cannot exceed 10 per cent, of its income or 1 per cent, of
                                its value.</p>
                            <p>The taxes on patents for trade and commerce and excise duties are to
                                be levied according to the existing laws, and to be collected at the
                                same time and in the same way as the imperial taxes. The taxes on
                                hotels and restaurants are to be levied according to the existing
                                laws.</p>
                            <p>The city council may ask the consent of the government for levying a
                                tax on lodgings. Certain now existing fees on property, auction
                                sales, verification of measures and weights, &amp;c., are to be paid
                                to the city. No other tax can be laid without a special law to
                                authorize it.</p>
                            <p>The disbursements of the city must be strictly limited to the objects
                                of which the city government has cognizance, and strict accounts
                                must be kept. Budgets must be drawn up of the proposed expenses of
                                the year and of the expenses of the past year, and must be submitted
                                to the governor, to see that they are in conformity with the law. An
                                extraordinary special unforeseen expense can be voted by the council
                                and put in a supplementary budget.</p>
                            <p>All officials of the city are strictly forbidden to be interested in
                                any contract or bargain to which the city is a party.</p>
                            <p>The methods of complaint against the city authorities are specified
                                in detail.</p>
