                    December 5, 1960, a revision of the order approved on March 26, 1925, by Mr.
                    Frank B. Kellogg, then Secretary of State. The text of the current regulation is
                    printed below:</p>

                <p>The publication <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States,
                        Diplomatic Papers</hi>, constitutes the official record of the foreign
                    policy of the United States. These volumes include, subject to necessary
                    security considerations, all documents needed to give a comprehensive record of
                    the major foreign policy decisions within the range of the Department of State’s
                    responsibilities, together with appropriate materials concerning the facts which
                    contributed to the formulation of policies. When further material is needed to
                    supplement the documentation in the Department’s files for a proper
                    understanding of the relevant policies of the United States, such papers should
                    be obtained from other Government agencies.</p>

                    edited by the Historical Office, Bureau of Public Affairs. The editing of the
                    record shall be guided by the principles of historical objectivity. There shall
                    be no alteration of the text, no deletions without indicating where in the text
                    the deletion is made, and no omission of facts which were of major importance in
                    reaching a decision. Nothing shall be omitted for the purpose of concealing or
                    glossing over what might be regarded by some as a defect of policy. However,
                    certain omissions of documents or parts of documents are permissible for the
                    following reasons: <list>

                        <p>53. Your 45, February 1, 1 p.m. The Department has received a
                            communication from the Navy Department requesting that necessary
                            diplomatic arrangements for surveys at Old Providence Island and
                            Cartagena be made by you. When actual dates of surveys as well as ships
                            and airplanes, have been selected, this information will be communicated
                            to you.</p>
                        <p>Please indicate to the President that the Navy Department greatly
                            appreciates the President’s approval of the proposed surveys and his
                            cooperative suggestion that the personnel should be temporarily attached
                            to the naval mission. For technical reasons it would be preferred by the
                            Navy Department not to accept that suggestion. Instead, if you perceive
                            no objection, please inquire of the President whether it would be
                            agreeable to have the survey made “at the joint request of the United
                            States naval mission and of the Ministry of War of Colombia, and under
                            their general supervision”. If acceptable to <pb n="2" xml:id="pg_2"
                                facs="0010"/>the President, please make diplomatic arrangements on
                            that basis. For your guidance, if original suggestion of President is
                            insisted upon attachment of survey personnel to naval mission will be
                            arranged.</p>

                        <p>75. Department’s telegram No. 53. In my March 10 conversation with
                            President it was apparent that … he is frightened by Alfonso Lopez’<note
                                n="4" xml:id="d3fn4">President of Colombia, 1934–38.</note> attack
                            on administration for too supinely delivering itself to the United
                            States (my despatch No. 1327<note n="5" xml:id="d3fn5">Dated February 4,
                                1941, not printed.</note>). He expressed a desire that all matters
                            pertaining to staff agreement or defense program be discussed intimately
                            and exclusively by himself and me as friend to friend. … In my opinion
                            his attitude and increasing disposition to flounder result from
                            aforementioned fears.</p>
                        <p>In this connection he desires following procedure: That I obtain and
                            confidentially give him details of what is required, <hi rend="italic"
                                >id est</hi>, soundings, mapping of harbor etc. together with
                            qualifications of experts to be employed; then in order to give
                            appearance of purely Colombian initiative he will request us to add to
                            naval mission aforementioned experts to perform specific duties their
                            report to be submitted to Colombian Government who will in turn give
                            copy to us. He also suggested that since Colombian Military Geographic
                            Institute was most competent organization of any kind in this country it
                            could make aerial survey of Cartagena. I did not refute this latter
                            statement since in principle he is agreeable to survey and I believe
                            that these technical details can be worked out in a satisfactory
                            manner.</p>
                        <p>If the Department and Navy Department approve of this general procedure I
                            recommend that I be supplied with data requested by Santos as soon as
                            possible.</p>

                        <p>Santos suggested Colombia’s procurement of munitions be financed by part
                            of an Export-Import Bank loan, remainder of which would be for economic
                            purposes as mentioned in my despatch No. 1335.<note n="7" xml:id="d4fn7"

                            it might be best to leave this phase of matter until we had necessary

                        <p>He also now suggests acquiring 1,000 ton freighters instead of revenue
                            cutters (see despatch No. 1333<note n="8" xml:id="d4fn8">Dated February
                                3, 1941, not printed.</note>). Obviously he hopes thus to form
                            nucleus of national merchant marine described in my despatches. I gave

                            conversation with President Santos yesterday afternoon he repeated the
                            assurances so often made to me that his Government would take every
                            precaution within its powers to maintain surveillance both of its coasts
                            and inland, to maintain internal order and to insure that no attack ever
                            could be launched on the Panama Canal from Colombian territory. Dr.
                            Santos added: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                    confidence that the totalitarians can do nothing in this country
                                    which remotely implies a danger for the Panama Canal, and if
                                    ever you or your Government have any observations to make in

                        <p>Perhaps the President’s aforequoted assertion was in part due to the
                            encouragement he has received during the last week from editorials
                            favorable to his foreign policy, which have appeared in the opposition
                            papers—the Conservative <hi rend="italic">El Siglo</hi> and the Lopez
                                <hi rend="italic">El Liberal</hi>. These editorials resulted from my
                            conversations with Doctors Laureano Gomez<note n="9" xml:id="d5fn9"
                                >Editor of <hi rend="italic">El Siglo</hi>.</note> and Alfonso
                            Lopez, as reported in my Despatches No. 1445 and No. 1447.<note n="10"

                        <p>In connection with this entire program I enclose a copy of
                                memorandum<note n="10a" xml:id="d5fn10a">Not printed.</note> of my
                            conversation with Dr. Urdaneta Arbelaez, until recently Colombian
                            Ambassador in Argentina, from which it will be noted that he strongly
                            favors and promises forcefully to urge on the President that Colombia
                            construct naval and air bases and permit the United States to use them.
                            Throughout this conversation I took the position that this was a matter
                            which the Colombian Government should first propose to us and that I
                            could not, myself, even discuss the matter excepting in an informal talk
                            between friends, such as he.</p>

                            afternoon may be summarized as follows:</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) He was delighted with word from Colombian
                            Ambassador in Washington<note n="12" xml:id="d6fn12">Gabriel
                                Turbay.</note> that latter had been informed by the Secretary that
                            $16,200,000 loan for defensive purposes would be available to Colombia
                            under the terms of the Lend-Lease Bill,<note n="13" xml:id="d6fn13"
                                >Lend-Lease Act approved March 11, 1941; 55 Stat. 31.</note> and
                            Turbay understood a portion would be free for use in Colombia in
                            projects such as the construction of military road from Quibdó to the
                            Pacific Coast.</p>
                        <p>To resolve details, Colombian Military Attaché there, Director General of
                            Navy now in United States, and Chief of Air Corps leaving here Monday,
                            would work with War and Navy Departments while Colonel Strong<note
                                n="14" xml:id="d6fn14">Lt. Col. Carl H. Strong, Military
                                Attaché.</note> and I pursue conversations here.</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="pg_5" facs="0013"/>
                        <p>He was surprised when I informed him only 3 to 4 million dollars would be
                            available in 1941 and the balance in 1942 and thereafter and said Turbay
                            had not mentioned this.</p>
                        <p>I strongly recommend that closest liaison be maintained throughout these
                            conversations by our governmental conferees in Washington and this
                            Embassy, together with our Military and Naval Missions.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) He accepted War Department’s interpretation of
                            staff agreement hence there was now complete accord on that document.
                            However, he desires to formalize it as a matter of public record through
                            an exchange of notes between our two Governments summarizing essentials
                            without going into details which might provoke prolonged debate in
                            Congress. He would instruct Minister of Foreign Relations to prepare
                            drafts for submission to us. This exchange of notes would be submitted
                            to Congress at July 23 opening during the second debate on Habana
                                Convention<note n="15" xml:id="d6fn15">Convention on the provisional
                                administration of European colonies and possessions in the Americas,
                                signed July 30, 1940; for text, see Department of State Treaty
                                Series No. 977, or 56 Stat. (pt. 2) 1273.</note> and as an
                            implementation thereof. He argued this procedure was desirable from
                            aspect of Colombian internal politics and would obviate necessity for
                            our reviving same matters with next administration.</p>
                        <p>I seized this opening to indicate exchange of notes might be analogous to
                            what I understood comprised recent agreement with Mexico<note n="16"
                                xml:id="d6fn16">See <ref target="#pg_403">pp. 403</ref> ff.</note>
                            including reciprocal uses of bases also mentioning General Van Vorlet’s

                            arranged joint maneuvers of Canal and Colombia military planes. While
                            neither of us knew the terms of Mexican agreement he was receptive to
                            both ideas. Hence, I request prompt instructions and if feasible copy of
                            Mexican agreement. While Santos is in receptive mood we should grasp
                            opportunity to cover the requirements of any military nature now
                            foreseeable as necessary for us to get from Colombia. Santos was anxious
                            that both military and economic loans be concluded before he presents
                            exchange of notes to Congress thus avoiding charge that one was based
                            upon the other.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) President was favorably disposed to allow our
                            military planes armed or otherwise en route between Canal and Caribbean
                            bases to pass over Colombian territory with emergency landings on simple
                            notification prior to departure but any subject to granting of previous
                            permission as presently.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) He was greatly concerned about difficulties in
                            the acquisition of materials and equipment from the United States and
                            adequate supply of shipping. I assured him both matters were receiving
                                <pb n="6" xml:id="pg_6" facs="0014"/>most continuous and careful
                            consideration by my Government and that we would endeavor always to meet
                            Colombian necessities but that exigencies of the situation
                            unquestionably would impose sacrifices on every one concerned.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">e</hi>) President declared conditions respecting
                            economic loan had entirely changed during my absence. Amount had to be
                            considerably increased above 6 million dollars he had originally
                            requested because that sum would appear unbalanced when compared with
                            military loan; public opinion would not understand why Colombia received
                            so little when Cuba<note n="18" xml:id="d6fn18">See <ref

                            doubtless had noted violent attacks on his administration by Alfonso
                            Lopez in this whole matter.</p>
                        <p>I presented self-evident counter arguments to his, strongly advising good
                            impression created in Washington by reasonable presentation of request
                            for 6 million dollars not be weakened by this sudden and inconsistent
                            increase especially as I had stated to Washington authorities additional
                            financial assistance would be required next year. Only then did he aver
                            additional amount was required (1) for stabilization purposes (2)
                            because lower revenues prevented Colombia contributing to public works
                            program as had been anticipated (see my April 16 memorandum: Colombian
                            Request for Financial Assistance<note n="20" xml:id="d6fn20"><hi
                                    rend="italic">Post</hi>, <ref target="#pg_57">p.
                                57</ref>.</note>). In my opinion these two points merit scrutiny. He
                            had no idea as to sums required under these two categories but would
                            request recently appointed Minister of Finance to go into details with
                            me. …</p>
                        <p>I pointed to his having importuned me prior to my departure for
                            Washington to obtain 6 million dollar loan as quickly as possible and
                            that his memorandum was the basis used by me to carry out his request
                            speedily and successfully; Export-Import Bank authorities and others in
                            Washington would be unable to understand sudden change and in view of
                            progress made pursuant to his request 6 million dollars had to be
                            starting point for conversations even with new Minister of Finance. He
                            feared that mention of this amount would induce new Minister to put
                            entire matter back in his lap.</p>
                        <p>I gave him no encouragement as to increase excepting that … perhaps
                            consideration could be given to earmarking additional sum requested for
                            a loan next year. He seized upon this with alacrity.</p>
                        <p>Providing we obtained all of <hi rend="italic">quid pro quo</hi> we
                            desire such as those mentioned in my April 16 memorandum, section (<hi

                            matters as Japanese trade encroachments on which I will cable shortly,
                            it may be desirable to accommodate matters by earmarking an even perhaps
                            small additional <pb n="7" xml:id="pg_7" facs="0015"/>amount this year.
                            On this entire subject I urge most complete and prompt interchange of
                            information between the Department and this Embassy.</p>

                            stated that the Colombian Government had heard that terms longer than 10
                            years were being offered to Cuba and that Colombia would have to have
                            similar treatment. He also stated that the Government had in mind 3%
                            interest with an annual amortization payment of $750,000. The Ambassador
                            was informed that 4% interest was the lowest that could be expected on
                            this type of operation, and that it would not be possible to arrange for
                            annual amortization payments in as low amounts as he had suggested. The
                            Ambassador stated that the amount of $13,000,000 would take care of all
                            of Colombian requirements through the end of 1942, and that the public
                            works mentioned are all now in process of execution but cannot be
                            completed without financial assistance.</p>
                        <p>The Department is proceeding to study the detailed request and consider
                            it in connection with the Export-Import Bank, the Department of
                            Agriculture, and, with special relation to the stabilization fund
                            request, the Treasury Department.</p>
                        <p>With respect to your Section A of your 158, the Department is pleased to
                            learn of the reaction of the President to the military defense program.
                            It is presently contemplated that the amount suggested would be
                            available only for military goods to be acquired in the United
                            States.</p>

                        <p>With respect to Section B, it is intended to present drafts of the
                            suggested notes to the Colombian Ambassador here within the next few
                            days.</p>
                        <p>With respect to Section C, special comments and instructions will be sent
                            to you.</p>
                        <p>With respect to Section D, your comments are of course the appropriate
                            ones, and the Department will continue to inform you regarding our own
                            export control and priorities procedures and will continue to press for
                            a hemisphere system of export control such as that suggested in the
                            Department’s circular instruction of April 1, 1941.<note n="23"
                                xml:id="d7fn23"><ref target="frus1941v06#pg_151">Vol. <hi

                        <p>With respect to Section E, it has been mentioned above that the new
                            matter is being considered. As you know, the Department finds itself in
                            a position of great embarrassment with respect to the Federal Loan
                            Agency and can only attempt to work out what may be best in view of a
                            difficult situation arising entirely from the handling of the matter by
                            the Colombian authorities. The comments on the balance of the economic
                            requests with the military requests do not appear well founded as each
                            are based on particular exigencies and are not parts of a related whole.
                            Moreover, the military arrangement covers a long period of time whereas
                            the original $6,000,000 request was specifically designated for one
                            year. There is of course no truth in any suggestion that this Government
                            is proposing to lend $20,000,000 to Ecuador. And in any event credit
                            arrangements are based upon specific programs and needs and not on any
                            attempt to balance amounts between nations.</p>
                        <p>The Department will furnish you with a copy of the Colombian memorandum,
                            and requests your comments.</p>
                        <p>The matters discussed in your 160 will be discussed with Ambassador
                            Turbay in connection with the further negotiations for the new
                            credit.</p>

                        <p>235. For Under Secretary. Referring to my despatch No. 1458, March 28,
                            last paragraph and Department’s telegram No. 127, paragraph number 5. By
                            reason of his uniquely influential position as a conservative leader who
                            has closely collaborated with the liberal governments of Olaya, Lopez
                            and Santos, I have long cultivated Urdaneta Arbelaez’ friendship. Among
                            other things I have encouraged his idea <pb n="9" xml:id="pg_9"
                                facs="0017"/>that Colombia in particular should emulate us in making
                            naval and air bases available to other American Republics.
                            Simultaneously I have emphasized my inability to broach such a proposal
                            to the authorities here and instead have said it should be volunteered
                            by his Government.</p>
                        <p>Urdaneta since his retirement as Ambassador to Argentina has become
                            member of Advisory Council to Foreign Ministry and is therefore
                            thoroughly familiar with staff agreements and related matters. June 20
                            when dining with him <hi rend="italic">en famille</hi> he expounded at
                            some length that political difficulties of the American Republics such
                            as Colombia would be greatly eased were staff agreements to be
                            formalized in a general agreement approved by conference of Foreign
                            Ministers. Despite considerations of my telegram 224, June 20,<note
                                n="24" xml:id="d8fn24">Not printed.</note> paragraph No. 2, he felt
                            such a conference now would be successful, suggested Rio de Janeiro as
                            locale since Brazilians would keep Argentina under control and he
                            believed that by giving Castillo<note n="25" xml:id="d8fn25">Ramón
                                Castillo, Acting President of Argentina.</note> credit for
                            initiative it would accommodate latter’s position vis-à-vis radicals and
                            bring Argentina into full cooperation; in fact Urdaneta himself would be
                            willing to go to Buenos Aires to work to this end. By reason of
                            Urdaneta’s influence as an outstanding possible conservative
                            presidential candidate and since Laureano Gomez and De la Vega have
                            argued for such a conference he believes Conservative Party could be
                            estopped from attacks on conference results. He concluded by offering to
                            discuss in detail with Santos to which I said I had no objection
                            providing that he presented whole idea as entirely his own and that my
                            role was exclusively as a listener since I was unauthorized even to
                            discuss it informally. In response to my inquiry he was confident
                            through a conference of this kind utilization of air and naval bases by
                            all could be embodied in basic inter-American agreement which in
                            practice would mean our being sole beneficiaries.</p>
                        <p>… I have always considered it would be unwise for me even informally
                            first to bring up topic of Colombian bases being made available to us.
                            On the other hand since we might at some time wish to enjoy these
                            facilities I have considered it advisable to encourage Urdaneta on his
                            own to explore the situation. In fact I feel that Santos’ suggestion (my
                            telegram No. 158,<note n="26" xml:id="d8fn26">May 17, 11 p.m., <ref

                        <p>Last night at intimate dinner in the Embassy Urdaneta said he had a

                        <p>171. Your 235, June 25, 4 p.m. Your message has been exceedingly
                            interesting and I fully approve the steps you have so far taken. I
                            suggest that you have some further conversations with the President and
                            find out more precisely what he has in mind and what his considered
                            decision may be concerning the wisdom of his going ahead with the plans
                            he has in mind.</p>
                        <p>For the time being I think it would be preferable for us to withhold any
                            commitment until you can see more clearly what his final considered
                            judgment may be.</p>
                        <p>For the time being I have personally felt it better for this Government
                            to refrain from proposing or supporting any plan for an immediate
                            consultative meeting of Foreign Ministers. As I know you will
                            understand, the situation is changing with kaleidoscopic rapidity and
                            the position of this Government would not be easy were a consultative
                            meeting to be held immediately in view of the fact that our own
                            international position and our own policy may be subject to rapid change
                            in the light of developing contingencies. Furthermore I have never
                            myself felt that technical military and naval questions such as those
                            embodied in staff conversations could be appropriately dealt with in a
                                <pb n="11" xml:id="pg_11" facs="0019"/>consultative meeting of
                            Foreign Ministers, first, because of the fact that secrecy could not be
                            maintained, which in my judgment is essential for a joint defense
                            agreement, and secondly, because at any meeting of the Foreign Ministers
                            political considerations due to publicity are inevitably bound to be
                            predominant. This objection of course would not apply to any formalized
                            multilateral agreement covering the reciprocal use of bases such as that
                            suggested in point 3 of your telegram under reference.</p>
                        <p>I should add that neither the Brazilian nor Argentine Foreign Ministers
                            believe that the moment is propitious for a consultative meeting and I
                            doubt whether, without their full support, the results of a consultative
                            meeting under present conditions would be as satisfactory as we should
                            desire.</p>
                        <p>I am giving you these views with the understanding that they are
                            tentative, but I wish to make as clear as possible to you the way the
                            Department is considering this question at the present moment.</p>
                        <p>Consequently I would suggest that you talk further with the President and
                            send me by telegraph all developments which may result from your
                            conversations with him, making it clear to Dr. Santos that we are
                            particularly sympathetic with the objectives he has in mind and would be
                            more than glad to cooperate should it be possible in our judgment for us
                            effectively to do so within the limitations I have indicated above.</p>

                                xml:id="d10fn27">Latter not printed.</note> In long conversation
                            with President this afternoon, after giving him ample opportunity to
                            bring up subject of Urdaneta’s 5-point message from him, I broached it
                            recalling his invitation to me. Santos, while admitting discussion with
                            Urdaneta respecting consultative conference of Foreign Ministers, at
                            first denied any mention of bases but later said there had been “some
                            vague reference thereto”.</p>
                        <p>I outlined as per your indications but not mentioning I had heard from
                            you, that while we were entirely sympathetic with his objectives, a
                            consultative conference might be inopportune at this time. Whereupon
                            Santos agreed entirely and added that these meetings of Foreign
                            Ministers were fast developing into Inter-American conferences with <pb
                                n="12" xml:id="pg_12" facs="0020"/>large delegations instead of
                            being limited only to Foreign Ministers; also too many subjects were
                            presented.</p>
                        <p>I explained I was mentioning air and naval bases to him solely because of
                            Urdaneta’s initiative and I traced for him my conversations with the
                            latter. Santos argued he had recently read in American periodicals that
                            far outlying bases were the only ones of value; that all we would
                            require in the Atlantic was Martinique; and that were the enemy to get
                            through our present bases the jig would be up in any case. (This
                            defeatist attitude is disturbing.) I argued the contrary thesis, telling
                            him of my conversation with General Van Voorhis who felt the necessity
                            for an air base at Barranquilla. Santos remarked that the extension of
                            the present Barranquilla airport was already under way. I said my
                            understanding was that requirement was for a military base with adequate
                            gasoline, supplies and shops.</p>
                        <p>Santos declared it would be utterly impossible for his administration
                            even to touch upon proposal for bases since it would provide violent
                            attack by opposition and particularly by Alfonso Lopez.</p>
                        <p>Following my explanation he agreed with my every argument as to
                            desirability of bases from aspect of common defense and said when he
                            retired to private life in his paper and in every other way he would
                            defend that idea, but his Government could not touch the subject. Since
                            he will not retire for over a year these are empty words.</p>
                        <p>An hour later he inquired whether there was any truth in reports that we
                            were acquiring Galápagos as base. I replied this was a matter in which I
                            had had no part but that here again the question arose of our being
                            unable to bring up matters of this kind even though they might be
                            mutually beneficial.</p>
                        <p>During conversation Santos several times repeated that in his message at
                            the opening of Congress July 2 he intended to make the most forthright
                            statement he could that relations between our two countries had never
                            been so good as now; from the beginning of the war the United States had
                            never made the slightest move to which any exception could be taken and
                            on the contrary we had been punctilious to an extreme; there was
                            complete confidence in President Roosevelt and his administration and it
                            was imperative Colombia dedicate herself unreservedly to friendship with
                            the United States; and that since Colombia in modern warfare could not
                            protect herself there was further reason for maintaining staunch
                            friendship with the United States.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>I brought up possible repercussions on Catholic population of Hitler’s
                            “Crusade” against Communist Russia. He said this presented a serious
                            problem to all South American Governments.</p>

                        <p>244. For Under Secretary. My telegram number 242, July 1, 11 p.m. There
                            is developing here not only in conservative church circles but even
                            among Eight Wing Liberals increasing sentiment favoring German victory
                            over Russia. While this is not surprising the development is greater in
                            extent than I anticipated and merits careful consideration. I get
                            reactions from variety of sources among which the following are
                            especially interesting:</p>
                        <p>1. Minister of War,<note n="28" xml:id="d11fn28">José Joaquin Castro
                                Martinez.</note> at our regular bi-weekly luncheon yesterday, was
                            tremendously exercised at “peril resulting from widespread conviction
                            throughout American Republics that Hitler, in his crusade against
                            iniquitous Communists, deserves full support.” He declared “Some action
                            or incident must be brought about immediately in order to commit all of
                            these Republics to the British and American cause to insure continued
                            hemisphere solidarity and to present the oppositions in the several
                            countries with a <hi rend="italic">fait accompli</hi> from which
                            withdrawal would be impossible.” He pointed to fact that all these
                            nations have suffered for years from Communist activities but so far in
                            no way had ever been injured by the Nazis; that as faith in crusade
                            increases, conservative church elements even though they be minorities
                            would adopt totalitarian methods and seize power becoming vassals of
                            Germany destroying whole inter-American structure and isolating the
                            United States. In fact a rapid German victory over Russia might swing
                            many American Governments directly into the Nazi orbit. He declared
                            there was no time to educate publics on true situation but could make no
                            concrete suggestion as to what should be done although he seemed to
                            flirt with idea that we should enter war calling upon other Republics to
                            join us. (This last thought goes much further than Santos was willing to
                            contemplate in our talk yesterday.) I gathered his alarm which he
                            admitted resulted from many conversations he had had and his political
                            sense was measurably induced by fear developments along these lines
                            would deprive him of office and influence.</p>
                        <p>While I do not highly rate Minister’s general boast, he is
                            administration’s ablest political contact with the masses.</p>
                        <p>2. Chief of Staff, a Conservative but genuinely friendly to us, while not
                            so alarmed as the Minister, quoted a number of friends, including
                            Liberals, as now preferring German victory over Russia.</p>
                        <p>3. Responsible University Professor tells me he has noted increasing
                            “pro-crusade” sentiment in many quarters including students.</p>
                        <pb n="14" xml:id="pg_14" facs="0022"/>
                        <p>4. Enrique Santos, President’s brother, in editorial column, while still
                            strongly supporting Britain and democracies, hopes two contenders may
                            kill off one another or that at least time be given for the United
                            States to prepare. He says Russian victory would be cure worse than the
                            disease and choice is between German injustice and Russian disorder but
                            implies German victory would be preferable since Russian disorder also
                            “contains the greatest of injustices to which humanity has been
                            subjected.”</p>
                        <p>5. Other reliable informants in various walks of life who are strongly
                            anti-Nazi are becoming alarmed by the increasing number of people they
                            encounter who hope for German victory over Russia The Nazis are, of
                            course, actively fomenting spread of the above described sentiments.</p>
                        <p>It is too early to foresee how far this trend may grow but thus far it is
                            increasingly disturbing. As a quick remedial measure and to counteract
                            muddled thinking on this subject I respectfully suggest possibility of a
                            speech by President Roosevelt amplifying the fine statement made by
                            Under Secretary on the outbreak of hostilities with Russia,<note n="29"
                                xml:id="d11fn29">See Department of State <hi rend="italic"

                            stressing anti-Christian (Catholic) acts and ideologies of the Nazis and
                            the other parallels with Communism. Because of his enormous prestige the
                            weight of the President’s words in a widely diffused radio address might
                            stem the tide.</p>

                        <p>245. For the Under Secretary. With further reference to my telegram No.
                            242 of July 1, I did not pursue with Santos formalization of staff
                            agreements for ratification by Congress since I consider it preferable
                            for us to hand him our own drafts for exchange of notes (as indicated in
                            section B of my telegram No. 178 of May 29, 1941<note n="30"
                                xml:id="d12fn30">Not printed.</note>) rather than to take as a basis
                            the Minister of Foreign Relations’ drafts when presented.</p>
                        <p>You will observe that although Santos reversed himself as I had feared …
                            the conversation nevertheless served to clarify his position so that we
                            now have better idea of where we stand at the moment.</p>
                        <p>The conversation has had the added advantage of for the time being at
                            least obviating Santos agitating for a consultative conference of <pb

                        <p>The most valuable result of talk is in my view the fact that while
                            formerly I could not properly bring up with Santos or others the subject
                            of bases it has now been placed on the table by Urdaneta in a manner

                        <p>188. The Department on July 7 handed to the Colombian Ambassador a
                                draft<note n="32" xml:id="d13fn32">Not printed.</note> of basic
                            agreement for the lend-lease program of transferring military matériel
                            to the Republic of Colombia. The principal financial provisions are as
                            follows: Colombia is to receive a total of $16,200,000 of war and navy
                            matériel, of which it is expected $5,000,000 of army matériel and
                            $500,000 of navy matériel will be transferred during the fiscal year
                            ending June 30, 1942. This delivery date is subject to change if broad
                            defense considerations so require.</p>
                        <p>With respect to repayment, Colombia is expected to pay $1,625,000 in each
                            fiscal year until 1947, making a total of $9,750,000 to be repaid prior
                            to June 30, 1947. In consideration of the broad objectives of the
                            program and of certain very general economic concepts, the entire
                            obligation of Colombia to the United States would be considered
                            discharged by such payments.</p>
                        <p>The Colombian Ambassador indicated that his government would be able to
                            pay not more than $1,000,000 a year and asked whether 9 or 10 years
                            might be allowed. He was informed that the entire program with all of
                            the American republics is limited strictly to 6 years. He undertook to
                            obtain at once the views of his Government.</p>

                        <p>286. President Santos in message upon opening of Congress July 20
                            declared relations with the United States “marked by most perfect mutual
                            respect” and “affection” and testified to “sincerity and good faith of
                            good neighbor policy.” He indicted Nazi philosophy, which he said
                            “simply means the destruction of our nationality” under which “countries
                            such as Colombia would pass automatically into state of vassalage,” and
                            that the defense of Colombia would be found in its position as a part of
                            the continental bloc.</p>
                        <p>The President declared “The Panama Canal is vital for the life of America
                            and vital for the defense of the United States; it constitutes for
                            Colombia an essential means of communication whose interruption would
                            occasion us untold dangers. Our condition as neighbors of this canal
                            imposes on us the obligation of seeing that it should never be damaged
                            or attacked from our territory.”</p>
                        <p>Referring to bases he said question had not been “proposed in any form
                            whatsoever” and that events did not seem to indicate need for bases. If
                            necessity should arise Colombia would have to solve it with its
                            resources and authority alone.</p>
                        <p>Economic cooperation is described as based on country’s needs and not in
                            exchange for political friendship but adds that this cooperation of the
                            three Americas must assume more intelligent and generous
                            characteristics.</p>
                        <p>Message has been eulogized in liberal press and <hi rend="italic">El
                                Siglo</hi> gave it more than customary kindly reception.</p>
                        <p>Full Spanish text has been forwarded direct air mail today.</p>
                        <p>I expressed today to the Foreign Minister my sincere thanks for
                            President’s fine reference to relations with the United States and my
                            admiration for message as a whole.</p>

                            yesterday emphasized to me the following: <list>
                                <item>1st. Colombian military requirements are not merely for
                                    equipment but for number of other items purchasable or requiring
                                    expenditures within this country such as for health,
                                    transportation, radio, clothes, lighting systems, et cetera. For
                                    example as reported by me over 2 years ago War Ministry
                                    purchased large number of steel houses from the United States
                                    Steel Corporation. These now stored Barranquilla but there is no
                                    money to erect them at strategic points along the coasts.</item>
                                <item>2nd. Military equipment now mostly 7 or more years old and is
                                    wearing out so that only protection on Pacific Coast is gunboat
                                        <hi rend="italic">Junin</hi> and two ancient airplanes.
                                    Public and Congress will soon ask why equipment is lacking since
                                    Government was authorized to borrow funds wherewith to purchase
                                    up to 30 million pesos and the United States authorities have
                                    publicly announced desire to aid.</item>

                                    returned from United States last week with “absolutely nothing

                                    includes certain declarations having political flavor” and

                                    that Colombia because of geographical location would be given
                                    preference in obtaining material but the two colonels report
                                    that some quarters in Washington considered this country
                                    important whereas others put at the end of list. For instance on
                                    aviation which has always been recognized as of prime importance
                                    for Colombia the colonels were told it was not sure when
                                    training planes could be supplied and that even the less
                                    advanced types of fighting planes could not be furnished until
                                    1943. This would mean that with wearing out of present equipment
                                    Colombian officers returning from instruction in the United
                                    States would be without ships to fly or to instruct their fellow
                                    officers.</item>

                        <p>I replied that the only draft I had seen (Department’s circular
                            instruction strictly confidential of July 11<note n="38"

                            briefly referred to inter-American political agreement<note n="39"

                            Then I called Minister’s attention to vital necessity of equipment of
                            all kinds being supplied to Great Britain, China and for our own
                            re-armament and hazarded opinion that a better understanding might have
                            been reached in Washington if Chief of Staff and Military Attaché
                                here<note n="40" xml:id="d16fn40">Lt. Col. Carl H. Strong.</note>
                            had more thoroughly determined all facets of this question reporting
                            their findings as a basis for Washington conversations (the Department
                            will recall Colonel Strong’s conversations with Chief of Staff were long
                            delayed despite Santos’s instructions, because of antagonism between
                            Ministry of War and General Castaneda and former’s failure to instruct
                            latter to pursue convention [<hi rend="italic">conversation?</hi>] with
                            Military Attaché; in fact Chief of Staff never has been able to go into
                            Colombia matériel needs with us). When the Minister agreed with me I
                            suggested that subject to approval of the Department, I would recommend
                            that detailed survey by these two officers be effected as soon as
                            Military Attaché returns from lowlands where he was forced by illness to
                            go day before yesterday.</p>
                        <p>There would seem to be much merit in Minister’s complaint at not
                            receiving training planes promptly and undoubtedly if expenditures were
                            properly supervised Colombia could beneficially use some free funds if
                            our policy permits, to improve efficiency of army and navy. Since I have
                            scant information respecting distribution of $16,200,000 loan I am
                            unable to express opinion thereon but do feel that this Embassy in
                            consultation with Naval and Military Attachés<note n="41"

                        <p>In view of the foregoing I would appreciate being informed as to how
                            matters were left in Washington by Colonels Tamayo and Buenaventura and
                            instructions as to whether Colonel Strong, perhaps with Naval Attaché
                            should proceed jointly with Chief of Staff to make detailed report and
                            survey.</p>

                                    rend="italic">Supra</hi>.</note> President yesterday afternoon
                            confirmed to me Minister of War’s statements and had me read Santos’
                            6-page letter of June 20 to Turbay which emphasized the same points but
                            also stressed that instead of undertaking large expense for purchase of
                            Springfield rifles, adequate supply of Mausers could be bought from
                            Brazil if we would supply financing therefor. Santos said Colonels
                            Tamayo and Buenaventura had been told in Washington that funds for
                            construction of military or quasi-military nature in Colombia would be
                            available under a Lease-Lend loan providing work were done by American
                            firms. However, he observed that American contractors performed work on
                            such lavish scale as to make it too exorbitant. His impression was that
                            those representing us in conversations with two Colonels were perhaps
                            unfamiliar with conditions here and trying to make a blanket program for
                            entire hemisphere which, by reason of varying conditions in each
                            country, was impossible. He felt Colombia probably did not need and
                            should not undertake so vast a program as was contemplated in Washington
                            conversations and concluded by suggesting that since Turbay would arrive
                            here next week conversations could be transferred from Washington to
                            Bogotá to be uninfluenced by the President and myself.</p>
                        <p>I countered by telling him of recommendation last sentence of
                            antepenultimate paragraph of my telegram under reference and suggested
                            that once Colombian Chief of Staff and our Military Attaché had
                            submitted their findings to him and me we could then, after reviewing
                            them, forward them to Washington for final discussion.</p>
                        <p>While I am unfamiliar with program as [apparent omission] in Washington,
                            I do feel that by restricting Colombian acquisition of equipment along
                            general lines suggested on <ref target="#pg_3">page 3</ref> my despatch
                            No. 1112 [<hi rend="italic">1122</hi>], October 28, 1940,<note n="43"
                                xml:id="d17fn43">Not printed. The suggestion was that United States
                                aid should be limited to facilitating the following: purchase of
                                training planes and ground equipment; improvement of airfields and
                                the building of such new ones as considered desirable; the purchase
                                of such other military equipment as is necessary to insure adequate
                                protection of airports and other strategic points and maintenance of
                                internal order; the purchase by Colombia of fast revenue cutters to
                                maintain surveillance of its coastline, and such other naval
                                equipment as recommended by the Chief of the United States Naval
                                Mission. (821.51/2553)</note> we will obtain from this country the
                            maximum effective aid they will be able to render for some time to come
                            in connection with Hemisphere and Canal defense. In fact, were this
                            Government to be given certain amount of free funds (Santos once
                            mentioned $1,000,000 to me but probably now has somewhat larger <pb
                                n="20" xml:id="pg_20" facs="0028"/>amount in mind) in addition to
                            really necessary equipment to be purchased in the United States, the
                            total loan probably could be kept considerably below $16,200,000. Even
                            though a part of “free funds” were to be ill-spent, the net financial
                            loss for us would not be as great as contemplated in plan outlined in
                            Department’s telegram No. 188 of July 9, 9 p.m.</p>

                        <p>234. From Duggan. Your telegram no. 304, July 30, 1 p.m. The points you
                            raise are being discussed with the War and Navy Departments. The
                            Department’s views on your four points are:</p>
                        <p>1st. It is not possible to supply free funds under the Lend-Lease
                            agreement.</p>
                        <p>Under conditions of very real necessity, resort might be made to the
                            President’s emergency defense funds. Under this procedure the War and
                            Navy Departments would have to demonstrate controlling reasons of a
                            defense character for such an allocation. Although obviously those two
                            Departments will have to determine for themselves whether in this case
                            such reasons exist, in frankness the Department is compelled to state
                            that on the basis of data presently available it would not be disposed
                            to attempt to persuade the War and Navy Departments to make such a
                            request of the President. If, however, you believe it desirable to look
                            into this possibility you should instruct your Military and Naval
                            Attachés to make complete reports in the premises to their own
                            Departments, furnishing copies of these reports directly to this
                            Department together with your recommendations.</p>
                        <p>In order not to raise the hopes of the Colombian Government for any free
                            funds, you are instructed not to make any mention of this possibility to
                            the Colombian Government.</p>
                        <p>2nd. Since Colombia has not as yet submitted its lists, neither this
                            Department nor the War and Navy Departments are able to do anything
                            until the schedule has been presented.</p>
                        <p>3rd. The declarations have no political flavor. They are simply
                            statements in the preamble to the draft agreement which refer to the
                            Declaration of Lima and state that the two countries together with all
                            other American republics are united in the defense of the Americas, are
                            determined to secure for themselves and for each other the enjoyment of
                            their own fortunes and their own talents, that the defense of each of
                            the American republics is vital to the defense of all and for that
                            reason the United States proposes to provide the defense articles later
                                <pb n="21" xml:id="pg_21" facs="0029"/>listed. These statements are
                            even less specific than declarations already arrived at in
                            inter-American conferences and meetings of Foreign Ministers. The
                            Department is sure you will have no difficulty in convincing the
                            Minister of War the agreement is not at all political.</p>
                        <p>4th. The Department is endeavoring to ascertain from the War Department
                            its attitude on plane deliveries.</p>
                        <p>The Department sees no reason why Colonel Strong (subject to instructions
                            from his Department) and the Chief of Staff should not go ahead in
                            Bogotá with a survey of Colombia’s needs. It is, however, impossible for
                            conversations regarding the details of material which will be furnished
                            to take place other than in Washington. Consequently, the survey should
                            be limited to determining what Colombia needs and not to committing this
                            Government on what will be delivered. It would then probably be
                            necessary that appropriate Colombian officers again come to Washington
                            to work out the details. If the War Department approves, this Department
                            feels that either the Military Attaché or a ranking member of the
                            Military Mission should thereafter accompany them to Washington.</p>
                        <p>Please impress on the appropriate Colombian authorities that this
                            Government wishes to assist them in negotiating a Lend-Lease agreement,
                            if such is desired, but cannot move until Colombia has acted.

                        <p>241. Your 312, July 31, 3 p.m. The Department’s telegram no. 234 of
                            August 5, 5 p.m. replies to the points made in your telegram no.
                            304.</p>
                        <p>The Department cannot believe that any governmental authorities informed
                            Colonels Tamayo and Buenaventura that free funds would be available
                            under the Lend Lease program for construction work provided this was
                            carried out by American firms. Since it is impossible to provide free
                            funds under the Lend Lease law no limitations have ever been formulated
                            or suggested. As stated, however, in the Department’s telegram no. 234
                            the War and Navy Departments might be persuaded to request the President
                            to make an allocation out of his emergency defense funds in order to
                            provide free funds for construction activity of an unequivocal defense
                            character. The statement is repeated, however, that the Department is
                            not convinced that the construction activity which the Colombian
                            military and naval authorities have in mind is essential to the defense
                            of United States.</p>

                        <p>341. For Duggan. Department’s telegrams 234 and 241. This afternoon
                            meticulously following instructions of telegrams under reference, I
                            discussed with President Santos possible Lease-Lend loan to
                            Colombia.</p>
                        <p>Turbay has reported to the President that the Under Secretary had
                            expressed hope that free funds might be obtained through R. F. C.,<note
                                n="44" xml:id="d20fn44">Reconstruction Finance Corporation.</note>
                            by special arrangements yet to be made by President Roosevelt
                            particularly as some other American Republics were in an analogous
                            position. While expressing my interest to learn of this report I said I
                            had not received it and my purely personal reaction was that it would be
                            imperative to base a request for free funds on a completely detailed
                            study demonstrating that the money was essential from a purely military
                            aspect.</p>
                        <p>The President was anxious to have the negotiations completed here but I
                            pointed out it was impossible because more than one department in
                            Washington was concerned and officials could not be brought to Colombia
                            because negotiations were simultaneously proceeding there with other
                            republics. Santos accepted with alacrity suggesting that insofar as
                            possible complete detailed list of Colombia’s military requirements be
                            prepared here in collaboration with the Military and Naval Attachés and
                            Chiefs of our Military, Aviation and Naval Missions and that one or more
                            of these officers should then accompany the Colombian officers to
                            Washington.</p>
                        <p>President says he is now anxious to conclude discussions of this matter
                            here next week. I should be surprised if any such speed is made.</p>

                            <p>These staff conversations were designed to elaborate certain
                                cooperative measures which Colombia and the United States, each on
                                its own volition, and as a function inherent in its sovereignty,
                                might be able to take in defense of the two countries themselves and
                                of the Western Hemisphere. The measures have been adopted in
                                pursuance of the obligations assumed in the interest of continental
                                defense to which all the American republics subscribed at recent
                                inter-American meetings and in particular at the meeting of Foreign
                                Ministers held in Habana in July 1940. They include such measures as
                                liaison between the military and naval staffs of each country for
                                the defense of the American hemisphere, this liaison comprising
                                complete and effective exchange of information relative to
                                continental security and the establishment of adequate channels of
                                communication. In addition, each country agrees to adopt appropriate
                                measures relative to coast patrols and to render the other suitable
                                assistance of a military nature within the scope of its resources,
                                legal authorizations or available means, such as the training of
                                personnel and the lending of technical advisers. Other <pb n="24"
                                    xml:id="pg_24" facs="0032"/>measures of this nature relate to
                                permission for visits of medical officers and aerial
                                photographers.</p>
                            <p>The United States will take such means as are at its disposal to
                                prevent attacks on Colombia by a non-American state while Colombia
                                will endeavor to prevent an attack from its territory on the United
                                States or its possessions, particularly against the Panama Canal. In
                                the event of attack by a non-American power, the United States,
                                should Colombia so request, will employ its armed forces to assist
                                in repelling any such attack while Colombia will supply timely
                                information and all possible facilities to the forces coming to her
                                aid. In the event that the United States sends its armed forces to
                                the help of another American republic as a result of a request or of
                                an inter-American consultation, to the decision of which Colombia
                                has given its approval, the latter will give all possible facilities
                                to United States forces advancing to the assistance of the attacked
                                country.</p>
                            <p>These measures have been adopted in an atmosphere of inter-American
                                solidarity and in a spirit of mutual helpfulness. They have been
                                drawn up and approved by both governments in the realization that,

                        <p>349. For Duggan. My telegram No. 341, August 9, midnight. The President
                            summoned me this afternoon and with the Minister of War present, assured
                            me that early next week he would give me a detailed list of all military
                            requirements for an army of 20,000, which they believe is the number
                            necessary. The principal items which they wish to cover under the
                            Lend-Lease Act are: <list>

                        <p>The President said “a <hi rend="italic">sine qua non</hi> to the entire
                            transaction” was that they obtain some free funds, in particular for
                            uniforms, construction of barracks, and for military road connecting
                            Quibdó with Bahai, Solano [<hi rend="italic">Bahía Solano?</hi>] and
                            Puerto Utria. He said that the uniforms and barracks are especially
                            necessary since it was discovered in recent plot that one of appeals
                            made to non-commissioned officers and troops was inadequacy thereof. The
                            President desires that Colombia be committed to repay free funds which
                            might be loaned dollar for dollar at usual rate of interest and not
                            under liberal terms of Lend-Lease Act. He again stressed that with
                            afore-described assistance both he and his successor could guarantee us
                            internal order throughout Colombia and that no attack on Panama Canal by
                            subversive elements would be attempted from this country.</p>
                        <p>He said equipment acquired under the Lend-Lease Act plus free funds would
                            total less than the $16,200,000 contemplated in the Department’s
                            proposal. He hoped I would carefully study both equipment and free fund
                            requirements; any questions I might have would be fully answered and he
                            earnestly requested that as soon as I was completely satisfied, I assist
                            them to obtain their needs in Washington.</p>
                        <p>I assured Santos and his Minister that Military and Naval Attachés and I
                            after carefully going over list would make recommendations to Washington
                            and assist him in every appropriate way. But that obtaining free [funds]
                            as I had before stated in my opinion would be extremely difficult and in
                            particular I did not believe any loan could be made wherewith to
                            purchase second-hand Mausers from Brazil. To this latter statement the
                            Minister of War replied that they could not get rifle ammunition from
                            the United States and the army was now “practically without any
                            rounds”.</p>

                            the only free funds that have thus far been made available to any
                            American Republic are $275,000 to Ecuador. These funds were furnished by
                            special allocation from the President’s emergency funds. It is repeated
                            that this is the only way by which free funds not to be repaid can be
                            made available.</p>
                        <p>Should the President desire that a U. S. officer accompany the Colombian
                            officers to Washington he should be neither your military nor naval
                            attaché but the chief or one of the officers of the advisory missions to

                        <p>417. My telegram No. 349, August 14, 11 p.m. President Santos yesterday
                            afternoon informed me Government was not empowered to sign a contract
                            along the lines of Lend-Lease draft contract enclosed with Department’s
                            instruction No. 858, of August 21.<note n="49" xml:id="d24fn49">Not
                                printed.</note> Moreover, he objected to this form of contract
                            because, (1st) it appeared to be an agreement between belligerents,
                            (2nd) rights of the United States to inspect and to suspend at any time
                            were unacceptable, (3rd) while acknowledging the liberality of the
                            terms, they nevertheless involved annual payments by Colombia of
                            approximately $1,000,000 a year, which, under existing circumstances,
                            was too heavy a burden for Colombia to accept. Therefore, he earnestly
                            begged that I do all possible to obtain a “free loan” of $6,000,000 at
                            normal interest rates to be repaid in full over sufficiently long period
                            of time—he mentioned 30 years—would not unbalance the annual budget.</p>
                        <p>$200,000 would be for aviation, Coast Guard cutters and some infantry
                            equipment; the balance for expenditure in the country including adequate
                            intelligence service for protection against subversive activities.</p>
                        <p>He preferred to obtain this money through a foreign loan but if that were
                            not possible he proposed to obtain authorization from Congress for an
                            internal loan. He observed that this latter course unfortunately would
                            bring the criticism that the United States was not assisting this
                            country in its part in heroic hemisphere defense program.</p>
                        <p>I believe that, although Santos may be reluctant to submit the proposed
                            lend-lease contract to Congress, as he claims would be necessary, the
                            fundamental reasons for his desiring a “free loan” are (<hi
                                rend="italic">a</hi>) that he wants the $3,000,000 for expenditures
                            (as previously described by me) in Colombia and (<hi rend="italic"
                                >b</hi>) point (3) above.</p>
                        <p>I also feel it is important for us at least to give the appearance of
                            assisting Colombia in defense loan. The $6,000,000 requested by Santos
                            would from our viewpoint be as effective in increasing efficiency of
                            Colombian forces as the $16,200,000 proposal now under consideration and
                            would have the added advantage of no financial loss for the United
                            States.</p>

                            </quote></p>
                        <p>The President preferred not to mention specifically the visit to Colombia
                            of aerial photographers and observed that this contingency could be
                            arranged readily under the provision looking to “the lending of
                            technical advisers”. …</p>
                        <p>The alterations made by the President, while rendering the exchange of
                            notes slightly more general, do not appear important, and it is entirely
                            possible that were the reference to aerial photographers to remain it
                            might give some rise to opposition in Congress.</p>
                        <p>On September 18 the President delivered to me a draft of the note which
                            he proposed as the Minister of Foreign Relations’ reply to the note
                            drafted by the Department. (copy enclosed)<note n="50" xml:id="d25fn50"
                                >Not printed.</note> Dr. Santos observed that he felt it was best to
                            omit all reference to reservations made by the War Department (see
                            Department’s strictly confidential instruction no. 500 of January 14,
                                1941<note n="50" xml:id="d25fn1">Not printed.</note>), since they
                            consisted merely of clarifications in form rather than in substance.</p>
                        <p>Should the Department care to make any further alterations in either its
                            draft or in that prepared by President Santos, I request that I be
                            specifically instructed in the premises, preferably by telegraph, <pb

                            induce the President’s acceptance of such changes. On the other hand, if
                            the Department desires no changes beyond those made by President Santos,
                            I request that I be instructed so to advise the President and that I be
                            authorized formally to complete the contemplated exchange of notes.</p>

                        <p>316. Your 417, September 19, 8 p.m. The Department continues perplexed by
                            the wavering Colombian attitude on lend-lease.</p>
                        <p>Please see President Santos again in an effort to untangle present
                            confusion. The Department goes into the following detail so you will
                            have its full thoughts: Colombia entered into lend-lease discussions on
                            the same basis as other countries. The Colombian Congress authorized the
                            negotiation of a defense loan. Colonels Buenaventura and Tamayo came
                            here to study availabilities and indicate Colombian needs. The results
                            were practically nil. As reported in your no. 304, July 30, 1 p.m., upon
                            the return to Bogotá of the aforementioned officers, the Colombians
                            raised several objections, including implications that the Agreement had
                            “political flavor”. These points were answered in the Department’s no.
                            234 of August 5, 5 p.m., and it is felt that point “third” of the
                            Department’s last mentioned telegram should be reviewed to President
                            Santos, to indicate that far from being an Agreement between
                            belligerents, it in addition has no political flavor.</p>
                        <p>Colombian instability is further illustrated by Turbay’s, last Spring,
                            requesting $6,000,000,<note n="51" xml:id="d26fn51">See <ref
                                    target="#pg_55">pp. 55</ref> ff.</note> stating this was all for
                            a year. This was procured promptly. After actual approval by the
                            Export-Import Bank, the Ambassador completely reversed his position by
                            wanting $12,000,000. He reiterated no further credits would be requested
                            for a year.</p>
                        <p>It is recalled from your telegrams that you were then dubious regarding
                            both the need or desirability of the additional sum. Nevertheless in an
                            endeavor fully to satisfy the Colombians, the increase was procured with
                            difficulty and embarrassment to the Department. Santos now tells you he
                            wants $6,000,000 more, making a total of $18,000,000 this year, in
                            addition to the $10,000,000 last year. This time they do not even say
                            they will not seek more.</p>
                        <pb n="29" xml:id="pg_29" facs="0037"/>
                        <p>Turbay called at the Department on September 16, saying Colombia was not
                            interested in receiving $16,200,000 worth of lend-lease equipment, but
                            preferred to cut this down to about $10,000,000 and make a repayment
                            arrangement of that amount proportionate to the tentative Agreement
                            which had already been reached for the higher sum. He said Colombia
                            really needed about $5,000,000 for local defense expenditures as a loan
                            on regular interest and amortization basis for as long as possible (it
                            is assumed these are the same funds Santos mentioned to you). He was
                            told that this would require the Department’s most careful consideration
                            and that he should make concrete his requests. No commitment of any kind
                            was made to him.</p>
                        <p>If the Colombians do not want the $16,200,000 arrangement, they should
                            indicate what their desires really are. The Department is far from
                            favorably impressed with the Colombian handling of this matter. They
                            persist with an outspoken trading attitude and, at the same time,
                            produce nothing concrete on the basic problem. They should state once
                            and for all what they desire and follow that definite course.</p>
                        <p>In all frankness to you, the Department at this juncture does not wish to
                            raise Colombian hopes for a defense loan other than the lend-lease
                            arrangement and you should not mention this possibility to the
                            Government. However, in view of the confusion, the Department would
                            appreciate receiving urgently your own opinions concerning the necessity
                            for such a loan, giving your reasons why you feel it should or should
                            not be extended, together with an indication of the minimum amount you
                            feel justifiable or would satisfy the Colombians. This will enable the
                            Department better to consider the matter.</p>
                        <p>The Department does not understand Santos’ statement to you that his
                            Government is not empowered to sign a contract along the lines of the
                            lend-lease draft. Is it for lack of authority or other reasons that he
                            cannot sign and what kind of a contract could he sign? While the
                            Department will listen to such modifications in the Lend-Lease Agreement
                            as Colombia might care to propose, it should be made clear that the
                            objections raised do not appear valid and that no other Government has
                            suggested that the Agreement appears to be between belligerents. Several
                            Governments have already signed and others are on the point of
                            signing.</p>
                        <p>The need for the provision regarding suspension should be obvious to
                            Santos, quite apart from its being required by the Act of March 11,
                            1941. Although this Government has every intention and hope of supplying
                            the equipment Colombia desires, it cannot unequivocally bind itself, on
                            account of the uncertainties of war developments, to definite
                            commitments. This Government believes that the terms are liberal and
                            entirely within Colombia’s capacity to pay.</p>
                        <pb n="30" xml:id="pg_30" facs="0038"/>
                        <p>Regarding “aviation, Coast Guard cutters, and some infantry equipment”
                            may the Department repeat that Colombia may obtain this equipment under
                            the lend-lease allocation and that unless it is so obtained, delivery,
                            which may be slow in any case, would probably be deferred
                            indefinitely.</p>
                        <p>Please have a frank talk with the President at his earliest convenience
                            and make the Department’s views clear. It should be pointed out that the
                            longer Colombia delays, the slower delivery dates will be, because of
                            previous orders placed by other Governments which have already signed or
                            which are progressively signing. Throughout, please make it unmistakably
                            clear that the “United States is not urging Colombia to take advantage
                            of the lend-lease arrangement and that the decision of whether Colombia
                            wishes to receive any armament from the United States rests solely with
                            Colombia.</p>

                            as I was leaving for appointment with President. I therefore arranged

                                <item>For well over a year the Colombian authorities have been
                                    discussing with me, but only in general terms, military
                                    requirements. However, despite my repeated requests for concrete
                                    data and suggestions that their needs be worked out to a

                                    Missions, they have apparently not even yet reached a decision

                                    he prepare a redraft for our study. This he promised to do, but
                                    on September 19 excused himself on the score that our draft was
                                    too divergent to be accommodated with his as it appears

                                            friendship for Colombia, we should assist this country
                                            with such a loan within reasonable limits, and if
                                            possible in such an amount as will make them content.

                                            them this financial assistance in order that they may

                                            Aviation and Military Missions to function efficiently
                                            and to avoid the criticisms which otherwise might be
                                            cast upon these Missions. Also for the army to obtain
                                            some new equipment may assist the Government to keep the

                                            internal order. Finally, there is a remote possibility
                                            that Santos might be willing to establish a Colombian

                                            requirements before making a final recommendation in

                        <p>322. Your 435, September 26, 10 p.m. With regard to the question of a
                            loan for military purposes, you mention in (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)
                            under numbered <pb n="33" xml:id="pg_33" facs="0041"/>paragraph 8 that
                            the loan would be used in order that Colombia “may acquire sufficient
                            equipment to enable her military and naval missions to function
                            efficiently.” Section (<hi rend="italic">e</hi>) under numbered
                            paragraph 8 also is interpreted to refer to requirements for equipment.
                            If this is the case the Department repeats that the Lend Lease program
                            is the only way in which Colombia can secure early delivery of military
                            and naval matériel from the United States. From the standpoint of
                            acquiring war and naval matériel in a reasonable period of time, it is
                            futile to continue to talk about any other procedure than the Lend Lease
                            program.</p>
                        <p>Please inform the President that this Government will, of course, be glad
                            to consider appropriate terms so that Colombia can secure under the Lend
                            Lease agreement $6,000,000 of military and naval equipment. (It is, of
                            course, obvious that this would mean Colombia would give up the
                            opportunity of securing $10,200,000 of additional military and naval
                            equipment under a Lend Lease agreement.)</p>

                        <p>452. My telegram No. 435, September 26, 10 p.m. In conversation this
                            morning with the President and Minister of War<note n="58"
                                xml:id="d29fn58">José Joaquin Castro Martinez.</note> I meticulously
                            reviewed all the considerations respecting Lend-Lease agreement outlined
                            in several recent telegrams from the Department. In particular I
                            emphasized that my Government was not urging Colombia to take advantage
                            of our offer, that the decision was exclusively Colombia’s but if he
                            desired any deliveries it was absolutely essential to have complete
                            details in the Department’s hands at the earliest possible date.</p>
                        <p>Santos by end of talk largely abandoned his previous arguments about
                            political flavor in such matters as “suspensioned,” although he raised
                            one innocuous new point: In article 5 of the draft word “consent” should
                            be changed to “with prior approval.” He remarked that other American
                            Republics had raised similar objections to Department’s draft. To this I
                            expressed doubt because I said I understood most already had [apparent
                            omission] said he was convinced present Congressional authorizations
                            only empowered his Government to borrow money to spend on armaments and
                            did not permit a deal direct from government to government for
                            matériels; hence new legislative authority must be obtained. He added
                            that this was <pb n="34" xml:id="pg_34" facs="0042"/>as much for our
                            protection as his own since his successor in office might repudiate the
                            commitments of the present Government. Therefore he proposed to redraft
                            the Department’s agreement in the form of a convention which, if
                            approved by us, he would submit to Congress. I suggested it might be
                            preferable for him first in broad terms to obtain authorization which
                            would permit him to sign a Lend-Lease agreement. He admitted this was
                            possible.</p>
                        <p>When I pointed out the delays involved in getting Congressional
                            authorization and the necessity for Colombia to get her requirements on
                            our priority lists as soon as possible he said that Turbay now had a
                            list of general classes of equipment needed but without prices or other
                            details. I expressed doubt that such a list would be of much use. He
                            said that he would have detailed lists prepared covering Colombia’s
                            immediate requirements and later others would be presented. I told him
                            for Colombia’s own benefit it was desirable to present now complete
                            lists with all details since otherwise due to wide and large calls on
                            our manufacturing capacity we could promise little or nothing for orders
                            placed in the future. He finally instructed the Minister of War
                            forthwith to prepare complete specifications, as urged by me.</p>
                        <p>While President once again confirmed 3 million dollar figure for
                            matériel, Minister of War observed it was more likely to be from 6 to 8
                            million dollars to which Santos by his silence seemingly assented.</p>
                        <p>Santos said Congressional attacks on recent military aviation accidents
                            had made army officers unwilling to pronounce any Colombian Army plane
                            fit for service. As a result Aviation Corps was practically paralyzed
                            and there was urgent need for small planes—bombers could come later
                            on.</p>
                        <p>The President again repeated that it was imperative for Colombia to
                            obtain some free funds and implied that the matériel acquired under
                            Lend-Lease already would be measurably ineffective without this cash. I
                            told him it was absolutely impossible to get free funds under
                            Lend-Lease, that Export-Import Bank could not lend for military purposes
                            and moreover in the light of embarrassment caused last May in connection
                            with increase in economic loan from Evans [<hi rend="italic"
                                >Export-Import Bank?</hi>] notion [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]
                            neither Colombia nor the Department could return to that institution for
                            another loan for a considerable time to come. He suggested that with
                            Department’s aid loan might be obtained from private institutions. I
                            discouraged this idea and said the only hope I personally could hold out
                            was for detailed estimate of free fund necessities to be prepared for me
                            and for careful checking by my Military and Naval Attachés. Based upon
                            their reports I might be able to send certain recommendations <pb n="35"
                                xml:id="pg_35" facs="0043"/>to Washington. Even in this case I said
                            I was not sanguine because of our legislative restrictions.</p>
                        <p>While there may be some element of a trading attitude in this situation
                            particularly in connection with free funds I think most of the confusion
                            arises from fact that War Ministry even with advice of our Military and
                            Naval Missions has simply been incompetent to decide on exactly what
                            equipment they desire. Also the administration fears opposition attacks
                            in Congress; however, we agree latter connection Santos admitted that
                            presentation to Congress of convention suggested by him would at least
                            make clear exactly who the pro-Nazi elements were among the opposition
                            and we both would know where we stand on this whole question.</p>
                        <p>Before submitting my own opinion concerning the necessity for a free fund
                            loan I still prefer to await the estimates thereon which are to be
                            prepared and submitted to me by the Minister of War.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to my telegram
                            no. 662 of December 15, 7 p.m., and to report that this morning the
                            Minister of Foreign Relations emphasized to me the well-nigh
                            unrestricted nature of the commitment undertaken by President Santos in
                            his December 13 telegram to President Roosevelt.<note n="61"
                                xml:id="d31fn61">For text, see Department of State <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Bulletin</hi>, December 20, 1941, p. 546.</note> So strongly
                            did the Minister stress the obligations thus assumed by the Colombian
                            people and Government <pb n="36" xml:id="pg_36" facs="0044"/>and himself
                            as Foreign Minister that I felt he was leading up to telling me that he
                            could not go along with the President in this stand. My reaction in this
                            particular was also induced by my having been reliably informed from
                            three separate sources that the Minister was the only Cabinet member to
                            vote against breaking relations with Japan and because of his having
                            wished to defer the break with Germany and Italy until after the
                            consultative conference. However, the Minister finally switched into a
                            long exposition, the essentials of which were as follows: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>This country, by President Santos’ telegram, is committed to do
                                    everything within its power for the democracies. Because of
                                    continental solidarity and defense, she is particularly
                                    committed to the United States and the Panama Canal defense. She
                                    will take every possible step; but, as I well knew, the Foreign
                                    Minister said, Colombian inefficiency would hamper these
                                    activities all along the way (he cited as an example the
                                    impossibility of obtaining competent intelligence officers). The
                                    Army would have been in condition to do its part, but the
                                    outbreak of the war in 1939 had prevented the shipment of
                                    munitions and armament from Belgium. Hence, the Colombian Army
                                    and Navy presently were practically impotent; the former even to
                                    maintain internal order required ammunition for Mauser rifles,
                                    but this could not be obtained in the United States, accordingly
                                    50,000 rifles with an appropriate amount of ammunition are
                                    needed. Similarly other equipment should be acquired.</p>
                                <p>He appreciated the high motives of inter-Americanism which led us
                                    to offer such a substantial discount under the Lend-Lease
                                    program; but this was tantamount to a gift, which Colombia could
                                    not accept with dignity. Therefore, in order for this country to
                                    do her full part, he suggested that under a Lend-Lease agreement
                                    we make delivery of $16,200,000 worth of equipment (he later
                                    admitted that a smaller amount would suffice), billing this
                                    country therefor at the aggregate of the annual installments
                                    contemplated in the Department’s proposal, i. e., $9,750,000. He
                                    suggested that the balance ($6,450,000) be lent in free funds
                                    for expenditures on strategic roads, barracks, uniforms, et
                                    cetera. (It will be observed that the total of the obligation is
                                    hereby raised to $22,650,000, i. e., $16,200,000 for equipment
                                    plus $6,450,000 in free funds.) The total obligation to be
                                    repaid would, on this basis, be $16,200,000. He feared that
                                    Colombia under war conditions could not safely undertake to meet
                                    the heavy annual amortizations provided under our plan and,
                                    therefore, requested that these payments should begin after the
                                    war. There were three other minor points in connection with the
                                    Lend-Lease program which he would like to discuss later, but was
                                    sure they could be easily adjusted. Turbay had been instructed
                                    to take this matter up along the aforegiven lines.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>I replied that I was sure my Government had understood the full portent
                            of President Santos’ telegram of December 13 to President Roosevelt. I
                            reviewed our discussions with respect to the acquisition of armament and
                            munitions, beginning with the time when legislation was still pending in
                            the Colombian Congress, when I had observed to him and to the Minister
                            of War that they were thinking in terms <pb n="37" xml:id="pg_37"
                                facs="0045"/>of millions when, in fact, perhaps it should be
                            hundreds of thousands of dollars. As for instance, I said, 20,000 rifles
                            would amply cover the Army’s needs in that item, and, as so often
                            discussed with President Santos, Colombia’s other requirements were
                            relatively modest: some aviation, some patrol boats, the repair of the
                            destroyers and perhaps some other equipment. In short, I had felt a year
                            and a half ago that Colombia should concentrate largely upon aviation
                            and a few other essentials rather than on so vast a program as was then
                            contemplated.</p>
                        <p>I summarized the conversations which I had had with President Santos,
                            beginning in January 1941, and made the situation clear with respect to
                            Lend-Lease and free funds, as described in my despatch no. 3237 of
                            November 5, 1941.<note n="62" xml:id="d31fn62">Not printed.</note> I
                            called attention to the fact that at no time had we wished to press a
                            Lend-Lease agreement on this country. For the same reason, while I had
                            called unofficially by telephone to the new Minister of War immediately
                            after he took office, I had subsequently awaited a call from him,
                            realizing that he was tremendously occupied with the reorganization of
                            his Ministry.</p>
                        <p>I said that the foregoing was the situation which prevailed up to
                            December 7. Thereafter, I had had no word from my Government, but my
                            purely personal opinion was that the acquisition of equipment under
                            Lend-Lease had probably become much more difficult than before. I had
                            seen a press statement from England to the effect that even Great
                            Britain expected to get much less. Therefore, while we deeply
                            appreciated Colombia’s desire to assist in every way, by force of
                            circumstances she might be compelled to concentrate her cooperation
                            largely on such matters as the control of enemy aliens, communications,
                            et cetera. Moreover, I said I could visualize, under the changed
                            conditions of war, our making certain requests which previously we had
                            not and would not even have mentioned, but which from now on might
                            enable Colombia to assist very effectively.</p>
                        <p>The Minister reiterated that, quite irrespective of whether or not the
                            United States could make a Lend-Lease and free fund agreement such as he
                            outlined, Colombia would give her every assistance without restraint,
                            but that naturally this cooperation could not be very effective unless
                            she were able to obtain equipment and funds as described in his
                            aforementioned proposal. I promised to communicate his thoughts to the
                            Department.</p>
                        <p>It seems reasonable to anticipate that, as the war develops, we will have
                            numerous facilities to request of Colombia, as, for instance, those
                            covered in the Department’s telegram no. 500 of December 13, 7 p.m.<note
                                n="62" xml:id="d31fn63">Not printed.</note> I am sanguine that many,
                            if not all, of these requests will be granted readily. Hence, the
                            Department may prefer to keep such matters entirely apart from the
                            assistance and facilities of a military or economic <pb n="38"
                                xml:id="pg_38" facs="0046"/>nature we may grant to Colombia. On the
                            other hand, were it possible to work out some such Lend-Lease and free
                            fund arrangement as the Minister requests, it might form a part of a
                            broad program of collaboration between the United States and Colombia
                            for Canal and hemisphere defense, and it might include an obligation by
                            Colombia to grant us, for the strictly limited period of the war, every
                            reasonable facility we might request. Self-evidently such an agreement
                            would be practically tantamount to an alliance.</p>

                        <p>675. No reply from President Roosevelt to President Santos’ telegram of
                            December 13 has yet been published here. Department may desire to
                            ascertain whether reply has been sent and if so giving publicity
                            thereto. Santos’ telegram is generally considered here to indicate that
                            Colombia is now fully behind the United States and Foreign Minister told
                            me on Monday that this country is thereby committed to the United States
                            and to Panama Canal defense.</p>

                                    everywhere is a severe one; the profound faith which you have so

                        <p>I have received with pleasure the message in which Your Excellency
                            comments in friendly fashion on the attitude of the Colombian Government
                            in breaking off diplomatic and consular relations with the Governments
                            of Germany and Italy in fulfillment of our pacts of Pan American
                            solidarity and in the service of the continent’s welfare. To work for
                            the honor and justice of our nations is indeed one of life’s rewards and
                            to be able to do so in the noble company of statesmen like Your
                            Excellency, to whom I am united by such lofty memories, adds a highly
                            cordial stimulus thereto.</p>

                        <p>182. My telegram No. 175. Minister of Foreign Relations<note n="64"
                                xml:id="d38fn64">Luis Lopez de Mesa.</note> summoned me this morning
                            to say he had been encouraged at first but later had been informed legal
                            technicalities made any platinum monopoly plan impossible. He had
                            insisted arrangement might be consummated through Bank of the Republic.
                            This also failed. Upon his restatement that such a strategic material
                            must go to Colombia’s friends there had been developed a “complicated
                            triple plan” whereby Government would follow same procedure as with
                            gold, and we to establish certain banking credits in the United States.
                            He did not yet have memorandum of details but said this plan would bring
                            criticism and greatly augment difficulties of preventing contraband in
                            metal. Therefore to satisfy public opinion here and “emphatically in no
                            way as a trade of favors” it had been asked whether or not we could give
                            assurances that Colombia would receive zinc, mercury, raw and
                            construction materials.</p>
                        <p>I repeated my previous statements to him and others that we were not
                            producers of mercury and it should be obtained direct in Mexico. I said
                            I doubt any assurances could be given on zinc. As for the other
                            materials we were and would continue to assist Colombia in every way we
                            could but sacrifices would have to be made by all and with daily
                            changing conditions it appeared well-nigh unsurmountable task to make
                            any definite promises.</p>

                        <p>152. Reference your 182 of May 31. The Department trusts that the views
                            of the Minister of Foreign Relations do not constitute a final rejection
                            of the proposal to purchase the entire Colombian platinum output as
                            proposed in our 124 of May 23. It is realized that there are certain
                            advantages which come from the sale of platinum to the <pb n="42"
                                xml:id="pg_42" facs="0050"/>Axis at high prices, but from a strictly
                            commercial point of view, it should be emphasized that the proposal of
                            Metals Reserve Company is to buy the entire output for a year or even
                            possibly more. This obviously has certain advantages over the Japanese
                            buying which for various reasons may stop at any time. But apart from
                            the commercial aspects of the problem, it is hoped that the Government
                            of Colombia will give proper weight to the hemisphere defense factors
                            involved in selling all its platinum to the Metals Reserve Company.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the suggestion concerning raw and construction materials,
                            the Department confirms the position which you have taken. Every effort
                            will be made to make available to Colombia the raw and finished products
                            which Colombia needs and this should be simplified by the recent
                            Colombian export control decree, but of course this desire on the part
                            of this Government is limited by the necessity of conserving in this
                            country materials urgently needed for national defense. This observation
                            applies particularly to zinc and mercury as to which no assurances can
                            be made at this time. In this connection it is suggested that you advise
                            the Department of any extremely urgent needs for raw and construction

                            hopes that a satisfactory reply will be given.</p>

                        <p>225. Department’s telegram No. 152, June 13. Minister of Foreign
                            Relations informed me this afternoon that exchange control office has
                            already issued two of the three decrees necessary to enable Bank of
                            Republic to purchase all platinum in a manner similar to that now
                            employed in purchasing gold. He hoped there would be no further legal
                            obstacles although one could never be sure in countries like the United
                            States and Colombia having so many laws (<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>).
                            However, he was confident by aforementioned steps all Colombian platinum
                            would be routed to the United States and he assumed contract for total
                            production for 1 or 2 years could be made with the Metals Reserve
                            Company.</p>
                        <p>Despite the Minister’s assurances, I fear illicit buying and smuggling
                            will continue.</p>

                        <p>196. Reference Embassy’s 250 of July 3 and 234 of June 24 and
                            Department’s 124, May 23. Metals Reserve Company is now willing <pb
                                n="44" xml:id="pg_44" facs="0052"/>to proceed with the purchase of
                            Colombian platinum upon the following conditions:</p>
                        <p>1. There must be an effective export control system which will prohibit
                            the export of platinum to any country except the United States, and to
                            other American Republics (or in the case of other American Republics
                            exports must be permitted only for internal consumption and not for
                            re-export).</p>
                        <p>It appears from your 250 that such an export control system has not been
                            established. The requirement of an irrevocable financing credit opened
                            in a New York bank is obviously not sufficient to prevent Axis
                            purchases. It must be remembered that the freezing orders are not broad
                            enough to prevent the obtaining of letters of credit which would result
                            in the platinum going to undesirable destinations. A solution would be,
                            if possible, to require that the consignee named in the letter of credit
                            be located within the United States.</p>
                        <p>2. It is understood the South American Gold and Platinum Company, owned
                            by American stockholders, produces about 50 or 60 per cent of the
                            platinum of Colombia and that the current market price obtained by this
                            Company is about $32.00 per ounce of fine platinum, f.o.b. New York. The
                            other producers who are willing to sell to countries other than the
                            United States obtain, it is understood, about $38.00 per ounce for their
                            product. South American Gold and Platinum Company is willing to continue
                            to sell in the American market at the price which it can obtain there.
                            It is accordingly suggested that a Colombian decree permit the producers
                            of platinum either to export their product under an irrevocable letter
                            of credit opened in New York to the order of a consignee located in the
                            United States, or to sell their production to the Bank of the Republic
                            at a fixed price. Metals Reserve Company will then agree to buy at a
                            price to be agreed upon with the Colombian Government all of the
                            platinum acquired by the Bank. It is suggested that this price be (1)
                            $36.00 an ounce for the platinum content of crude metal, the Bank of the
                            Republic to pay its incidental costs out of this gross price or (2) the
                            current price of fine platinum in the United States for the platinum
                            content; whichever of these two prices will be the higher. Since the
                            $36.00 price is and probably will continue to be higher than the market
                            price in the United States, it is assumed that all of the platinum will
                            be bought by the Bank of the Republic and resold to Metals Reserve
                            Company with the exception of the South American Gold and Platinum
                            Company whose production, in accordance with an understanding with us,
                            will continue to be shipped directly to the trade in the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>3. The contract will be for one year. It will consist of a commitment of
                            Metals Reserve Company to buy not in excess of a certain fixed number of
                            fine ounces of platinum, say 40,000 ounces. Any <pb n="45"
                                xml:id="pg_45" facs="0053"/>amount sold directly to the trade will
                            be credited on the obligation of the Metals Reserve Company to buy. The
                            figure of 40,000 being in excess of the normal production of Colombia is
                            intended to be and is in effect an obligation to acquire the total
                            production of Colombian platinum.</p>
                        <p>4. You are requested to discuss this proposal with the appropriate
                            Colombian authorities and to start your discussions as has been
                            indicated with the suggested price of $36.00 per ounce for the platinum
                            content of crude. In addition Metals Reserve will pay for other metals
                            contained in the crude platinum $18.00 per ounce for osmiridium, for
                            pure gold $34.50 per troy ounce, and for palladium $15.00 per troy
                            ounce. It is understood that these prices are in accordance with
                            existing commercial practice.</p>
                        <p>5. These prices are c. i. f. New York. Settlement for the material will
                            be made on the basis of assays by an experienced platinum assayer in the
                            United States. In this connection the Bank of the Republic may wish
                            technical assistance in setting up its own system of purchasing from the
                            producers in Colombia. Metals Reserve would be prepared to send a
                            representative to Colombia to assist in arranging for local assays, and
                            other details that may arise in connection with the purchasing.</p>
                        <p>When an agreement has been reached in principle on the above proposal, a
                            formal contract will be drafted here and sent to you for submission to
                            the Colombian authorities.</p>
                        <p>The Department regards the completion of an agreement which will achieve
                            the results above suggested as of substantial and immediate importance
                            to the defense program. It desires that the agreement be put into effect
                            at the earliest practicable moment. It is accordingly suggested that you
                            telegraph the Department as soon as possible as to the course of the
                            negotiations.</p>

                        <p>294. For details letter with reference to our telephone conversation
                            today Chief of Exchange and Export Control has agreed to delay approval
                            of export permits for platinum covered by irrevocable letters of credit
                            number 1140 for $12,167, number 1138 for $44,965, both on the
                            Manufacturers Trust Company of New York and number 3687 for $4,150 on
                            the National City Bank of New York for so long as possible probably 2 or
                            3 days but he urges that the Manufacturers Trust Company and the
                            National City Bank of New York would like cancellation <pb n="46"
                                xml:id="pg_46" facs="0054"/>of the above credits to the Banco de

                            New York banks issue any credits having to do with platinum. Meanwhile
                            the Colombians are studying the proposals embodied in Department’s
                            telegram No. 196<note n="65a" xml:id="d44fn65a"><hi rend="italic"

                            way. The authorities expect that at least we can control our own banks.
                            Since no platinum shipment can be made except on letter of credit opened
                            in New York as indicated in my telegram No. 250 by preventing could [<hi

                        <p>217. Reference your 294, July 23. The Department has referred the matter
                            of the three letters of credit to the Treasury for immediate action
                            under the recent Executive Order freezing Japanese funds.</p>
                        <p>It is clear that the recent freezing order is not sufficient to make the
                            instructions from the Office of Control of Exchange and Exports
                            requiring the issuance of irrevocable letters of credit by New York
                            banks the solution of the problem. It is still necessary even with this
                            freezing order to have some supplementary Governmental action either in
                            the form of executive decree or legislative enactment, as you may
                            determine, to perfect the prohibition of exports except to the United
                            States. After discussion with Wright<note n="66" xml:id="d45fn66"
                                >Possibly James H. Wright of the Division of the American
                                Republics.</note> it seems to the Department that the best method
                            would be a decree, resolution or other similar action requiring as a
                            matter of law the sale of all platinum to the Bank of the Republic (with
                            the one possible exception mentioned below). This method, according to
                            Wright, has the advantage that it might encourage the proper authorities
                            to use more vigilance to prevent smuggling than they otherwise would.
                            Wright states that it is his belief that the basic exchange legislation
                            is sufficiently broad <pb n="47" xml:id="pg_47" facs="0055"/>to enable
                            either the Ministry of Finance or the Control Board to issue an
                            appropriate decree or regulation to this end. Your views are requested.
                            The Department will naturally be guided by you as to the form the
                            Governmental action is to take, provided that it achieves the main
                            objectives which are, first, the ironbound prohibition of exports except
                            to the United States, and, second, keeping smuggling to a minimum. The
                            present set-up leaves loopholes which must be stopped. The one exception
                            referred to above is the South American Gold and Platinum Company which
                            should be allowed, if the Colombian authorities approve, to continue its
                            exports of platinum directly to the American market.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the closing paragraph of your 294, please telegraph the
                            amount of platinum now on hand which it is suggested the Metals Reserve
                            Company offer to purchase and also telegraph the price at which you
                            believe it necessary for the Metals Reserve Company to offer. If
                            possible, this price should not be in excess of that set forth in the
                            Department’s 196.</p>
                        <p>Chargeable to Metals Reserve Company, in accordance with Section V–45,

                            have little effect unless Metals Reserve Company were prepared to pay a

                            and such prices would inevitably lead to widespread smuggling. What are

                        <p>236. Your 327, August 4, has been discussed with the Treasury. The
                            Treasury officials tell us that they are telephoning the New York banks
                            which issued the letters of credit and are instructing these banks to
                            telegraph to the Banco de Bogotá instructing that bank that no drafts on
                            the letters of credit which have been or shall be drawn on or after July
                            26 will be honored unless a license is granted by the Treasury. The
                            Treasury will not authorize any such licenses and, therefore, the effect
                            of the foregoing is to cancel or more properly to suspend during the
                            existence of the freezing order, the letters of credit. Please telegraph
                            if this arrangement is satisfactory to the Colombian authorities.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the closing paragraph of your 327, it has been
                            understood from the telephone conversation of August 1 that legislation
                            subjecting platinum to the same restrictions as gold would be most
                            difficult to obtain. It was furthermore understood that your strong
                            recommendation was that export control be obtained through control of
                            the New York banks, that is to say, by having the Treasury instruct the
                            New York banks that no letters of credit for the export of platinum
                            except to the United States should be issued. The Department has
                            accordingly taken up this proposal with the Treasury and is urging upon
                            them the taking of the necessary steps to carry out the program along
                            these lines. As yet no definite reply has been received, but it is
                            expected that action along these lines will be put into effect by the
                            Treasury. Pending the reply from Treasury, and further consideration of
                            whether this action will be sufficient for the purpose, the Department
                            reserves judgment as to legislation. However, it is noted from your
                            telegram no. 327, second paragraph, that the Commercial Section of the
                            Foreign Office is considering introducing a bill to place same
                            restrictions on platinum as now exist for gold. The Department feels you
                            should encourage this action and in the meanwhile the Colombians should
                            use maximum control possible under their present legal set-up. Smuggling
                            is a problem the Colombians will have to control. The United States is
                            offering to purchase Colombia’s entire platinum output for a year while
                            Japan can give no such assurances.</p>
                        <p>The Department will be largely guided by your advice.</p>

                                >August 22, 4 p.m., not printed.</note> Yesterday afternoon I
                            emphasized to President Santos that it was imperative no platinum go to
                            Japan or other totalitarian country. He replied, “As you know that has
                            been arranged. What about the silk?” He then expressed deep regret for
                            the matter having been taken up with me on Friday<note n="69"
                                xml:id="d48fn69">August 22.</note> both the Foreign Minister and
                            myself. I reassured him on this and repeated the hope already stated to
                            the Minister for Foreign Affairs that the Colombian Government would, in
                            view of the military requirements in the United States, withdraw its
                            request in this particular. He said since failure to get silk would ruin
                            mill and put 284 employees out of work he preferred not to commit
                            himself but leaves the matter to be worked out between the Foreign
                            Minister and myself.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister told me on 22d that the Japanese would accept
                            nothing in exchange for silk but platinum, not even gold metal.</p>

                            giving in detail the Colombian platinum and silk situation. You may find
                            the information contained therein is sufficient to enable you to work
                            out a solution for the matter as presented in your 369, August 24. Would
                            you kindly cable an estimate of the quantity of silk that Colombia on
                            the basis of ordinary consumption would need to carry it through an
                            adjustment period of some 3 months at the end of which it should be
                            possible for the mills to utilize other materials making adjustments
                            similar to those faced by the silk and hosiery mills of the United
                            States. No promise can be held out that even a very small amount of silk
                            can be procured for Colombia in the light of the fact that practically
                            none is being made available for civilian use in the United States;
                            however, on receipt of estimates of the quantities needed, fresh
                            consideration could possibly be obtained in the matter in the light of
                            our very real wish that none of the platinum go to destinations other
                            than this country.</p>

                        <p>Should the mills be able to use rayon, which probably will turn out to be
                            the main material used in the replacement of silk in the United States,
                            it might well be easier to obtain rayon supplies for Colombia. The
                            Department is willing to make every effort to try to see that Colombian
                            mills receive the same consideration as regards rayon supply as the
                            mills in the United States producing for civilian use.</p>
                        <p>In estimating the amount of silk needed to carry the mills for 3 months,
                            you should of course deduct any stocks which are now on hand in
                            Colombia, separately reporting the same to the Department.</p>

                        <p>393. For Finletter. Reference is made to the Department’s telegram No.
                            270, August 27, 5 p.m. Yesterday Minister for Foreign Relations handed
                            me a memorandum giving the requirements of the five Colombian silk mills
                            at 44,418 pounds per quarter, stocks now on hand amounting to 31,532
                            pounds although some mills, including Modelia, have less than a month’s
                            supply. Memorandum states that while Colombian Government appreciates
                            Department’s attitude in placing Colombian factories on the same footing
                            as American as concerns rayon, local manufacturers claim it will take
                            some time to adapt equipment to rayon and that natural silk must be
                            obtained to prevent closing plants. If these allegations are untrue I
                            would appreciate full information together with definite assurances of a
                            rayon supply otherwise I recommend that the silk situation be earnestly
                            considered, a prompt decision taken and we be informed by telegraph.</p>
                        <p>While we have succeeded in temporarily divorcing platinum and silk it is
                            necessary that platinum negotiations be concluded without further delay
                            and essential that the 62,376 grams of this metal now on hand be
                            purchased at once.</p>
                        <p>Recent press articles state that because Japan is no longer purchasing,
                            platinum price has fallen below that for gold. The Government in
                            principle has accepted all our proposals. Therefore, I recommend that
                            duly authorized representative of the Metals Reserve Company be sent to
                            Bogotá by plane to conclude contract, organize the purchasing program,
                            and instruct the Bank of the Republic in all <pb n="51" xml:id="pg_51"
                                facs="0059"/>details regarding assay shipment, et cetera. The only
                            point still open for discussion is whether to set a price of $38 per
                            fine ounce for the life of contract or to set prices for shorter
                            periods; Chief of Exchange Control Office says either procedure will be
                            acceptable.</p>
                        <p>Every day’s delay will further complicate the situation. Already
                            “jewelers” in both Argentina and Cuba are reportedly making offers and
                            with the Bank of the Republic unable to proceed or to offer to purchase
                            platinum, prompt and immediate action must be taken.</p>

                            concerning the status of arrangements for purchase of platinum through
                            the Banco de la Republica.</p>
                        <p>The National City Bank at Bogotá advises that the Banco de la Republica
                            has not yet made shipment of the 1900 ounces already held, and had not
                            informed them of any further purchase to apply against the further

                        <p>Meanwhile there is reason to believe that contraband exports continue and
                            the Embassy believes that the Exchange Control authorities in certain
                            cases allow open selling, witness a shipment of United States dollars

                        <p>460. Your 585, November 26. From this telegram and from a letter dated
                            November 17 from the Banco de la Republica to Metals Reserve Company
                            received recently, Metals Reserve has the impression that Colombian
                            authorities now regard the price of $38 an ounce for fine platinum, c.
                            i. f. New York, as an offer by Metals Reserve without a corresponding
                            obligation on the part of the Colombian Government. This is not the case
                            however. The offer of the Metals Reserve Company to pay $38 an ounce was
                            conditioned on the understanding that the Colombian Government would
                            deliver the total annual Colombian production up to 40,000 ounces during
                            the period of one year, less amounts sold direct to the trade in the
                            United States, and that accordingly exports to other countries would be
                            prohibited.</p>
                        <p>In recognition of such effective export control, Metals Reserve offered
                            to take such net total annual production at the $38 price which is in
                            excess of the current market price in the United States.</p>
                        <p>Metals Reserve requests that the Banco de la Republica be advised that
                            Baker and Company has estimated the cost of refining at $1.50 per ounce
                            of crude platinum. Metals Reserve understands from the aforementioned
                            letter of November 17 that Banco de la Republica is prepared to assume
                            the cost of refining.</p>
                        <p>With the understanding that the prices for gold and palladium are
                            definitely fixed, but that the osmiridium price will be half the price
                            paid for platinum, Metals Reserve will further agree that in the event
                            the official United States market price for platinum exceeds $38 per
                            ounce, it would be willing, at least, to consider with the Banco de la
                            Republica possible price increase, providing the Banco de la Republica
                            would similarly be prepared to consider revision downward if the
                            official United States market price declined below present market of
                            approximately $34.</p>
                        <p>The National City Bank branch in Bogotá was placed in funds in
                            mid-September, and Metals Reserve was prepared to purchase the first lot
                            of 1,900 ounces at Cali. The delay in effecting delivery of this <pb
                                n="53" xml:id="pg_53" facs="0061"/>material is apparently caused by
                            the failure of the Banco de la Republica to act on Metals Reserve
                            agreement forwarded September 23 outlining in detail its agreement
                            between representatives of our respective Governments, the Banco de la
                            Republica, and the Federal Loan Agency. Settlement in New York after
                            delivery assaying and refining is, of course, entirely satisfactory, and
                            with this additional information it would appear that a conclusion
                            should be effected without further delay. Please urge the Colombians to
                            expedite this matter.</p>

                            and Metals Reserve wish to conclude platinum purchase agreement so that
                            it may be placed in effect as soon as possible. Please urge upon
                            Colombian authorities importance of taking all necessary steps to
                            prevent smuggling. Do you think it would be desirable to request
                            cooperation of Panair and Panagra in inspecting all baggage carried by
                            plane? It is understood that these airlines already have a system of
                            inspection for bombs and inflammable material, and Department would be
                            willing to take up with them the question of additional inspection for
                            platinum if you approve.</p>

                            inform you well in advance of any sales they may intend to make to

                        <p>538. Following from Metals Reserve:</p>
                        <p>“Reference is made to telegram no. 610, dated December 4<note n="73"
                                xml:id="d55fn73">Not printed.</note> from the Embassy and to
                            telegrams nos. 460 and 480 dated December 4 and 9 from the Department
                            bearing on the subject of platinum.</p>
                        <p>Representatives of the largest Colombian producer of platinum, the South
                            American Gold and Platinum Company, have shown concern over reports that
                            the Colombian Government may issue decrees requiring all producers of
                            platinum to sell their production to the Bank <pb n="54" xml:id="pg_54"
                                facs="0062"/>of the Republic. Previous telegrams on this subject as
                            well as the text of the agreement sent by the Metals Reserve Company to
                            the Bank of the Republic simply provide that the Metals Reserve will
                            purchase all platinum produced in Colombia and not sold through private
                            channels to the United States.</p>
                        <p>It does not appear necessary for the production of the South American
                            Gold and Platinum Company to be included in the proposed contract
                            between Metals Reserve Company and the Bank of the Republic since the
                            South American company has satisfactory arrangements with private
                            consumers in this country under which the use of the product can be
                            controlled for defense purposes if necessary. In addition, Metals
                            Reserve does not wish to have to pay the proposed subsidy price of $38
                            an ounce for this company’s very substantial production, which is
                            understood to amount to two-thirds of that of the entire country.</p>
                        <p>It is believed that the Colombian Government can establish satisfactory
                            control of the platinum situation without forcing all sellers to sell to
                            the Bank of the Republic through requiring registration along the same
                            lines as in the case of gold sellers. If this is done and if sellers are
                            required to obtain satisfactory letters of credit from United States
                            bank before being permitted to export, continued sales through private
                            channels should be feasible. Metals Reserve Company will, of course,
                            continue to be prepared to purchase platinum not sold to the United
                            States through private channels, provided only the necessary export
                            regulations are put into effect.[”]</p>

                            on the same basis as it now purchases gold. A representative of the

                            no. 1111 of October 22, 1940,<note n="75" xml:id="d57fn75">Not

                            appeal to us for financial assistance, and to report that on January 31,
                            1941, I called on President Santos at his request.</p>
                        <p>The President expressed his gratification with the working out of the
                            coffee agreement,<note n="76" xml:id="d57fn76">See <ref
                                    target="frus1940v05#pg_380"><hi rend="italic">Foreign

                                    380</ref> ff.</note> said the outlook was bright and thought
                            Colombia could maintain economic equilibrium providing it got through
                            1941, which was the critical year. But conceivably Colombia would
                            require financial assistance in this connection if everything did not
                            work out as hoped for. Therefore, he wished me to study with the
                            Minister of Finance<note n="77" xml:id="d57fn77">Carlos Lleras
                                Restrepo.</note> a plan contemplating a five million dollar loan in
                            the event assistance were needed and needed quickly at any time. It was
                            essential to hold up coffee prices and sales, otherwise chaos would
                            result (<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>).</p>
                        <p>He continued that there were also certain public works which he would
                            like to forward and which would need financing. It would be no great sum
                            because he had no ambition to leave a series of monuments to himself in
                            the form of public works, and with them obligations on the people. But
                            there were such undertakings as an electrification <pb n="56"
                                xml:id="pg_56" facs="0064"/>program, which he would like to get
                            underway. These public works he also desired me to discuss with the
                            Minister of Finance.</p>
                        <p>I replied that I would be very happy to study these matters with his
                            Minister and I deemed it wise to do so well in advance of the time when
                            funds would be requested because there were so many details to be gone
                            into in the way of preparation so that we would know beforehand exactly
                            what could be done and how. I, of course, had in mind the adjustment of
                            such matters of common interest as were mentioned in my despatch under
                            reference.</p>
                        <p>This part of the conversation concluded by the President saying he would
                            on February 3 instruct his Minister of Finance to get in touch with me
                            on these several matters; also, he would discuss them further with me
                            himself, probably within another week or so.</p>

                        <p>79. The Colombian Embassy is completing preparation of the detailed offer
                            to the holders of the Federal dollar bonds. With this matter out of the
                            way, the Department believes it important that the Colombian Government
                            proceed with discussions regarding the Federally-guaranteed agricultural
                            mortgage bank debt, and that some settlement be worked out for the
                            several provincial, local and banking issues. Please investigate the
                            prospect for such further debt discussions and report to the Department
                            personally when you arrive in Washington.</p>

                        <p>As will be recalled, President Santos on January 30, 1941, summoned me to
                            indicate that Colombia would appreciate receiving in the near future
                            financial assistance for both economic and military purposes.</p>
                        <p>Following other conversations with the President and his Ministers, which
                            were reported to the Department, Dr. Santos on the morning of March 31,
                            1941 had delivered to me a letter and memorandum, as per the enclosed
                                copies,<note n="78" xml:id="d60fn78">Not printed.</note> requesting
                            a $10,000,000 loan for 10 years to be made direct to the Colombian
                            Government (<hi rend="italic">not</hi> to the Banco de la Republica with

                        <p>The proceeds of this $10,000,000—17,500,000 pesos according to the
                            enclosed memorandum would be distributed: <list>

                            </list></p>
                        <p>My observations on certain details of the military requirements are given
                            in the enclosed memorandum. It is pertinent to add that I have expressed
                            to President Santos, the Minister of War and Ambassador Turbay<note
                                n="79" xml:id="d60fn79">Gabriel Turbay, Colombian Ambassador in the
                                United States.</note> my purely personal opinion that the
                            Export-Import Bank might be unable, under its authorization, to grant
                            credits for military purposes, but that subject to priority restrictions
                            Colombia’s necessities in these particulars probably could be cared for
                            under the provisions of the “Lend-Lease Bill”<note n="80"
                                xml:id="d60fn80">Act approved March 11, 1941; 55 Stat. 31.</note>
                            and in that case the interest rate and other terms might be more
                            advantageous to Colombia than through a straight banking operation.</p>
                        <p>There is also enclosed copy of memorandum<note n="78" xml:id="d60fn1">Not
                                printed.</note> handed me by Ambassador Turbay—pursuant to Dr.
                            Santos’ promise to forward further details to me. It will be noted that
                            the amount requested in this document—7,000,000 pesos—covers only the
                            program for this year of the Ministry of Public Works. The Ambassador
                            estimates that the Ministry of National Economy will need between
                            3,500,000 and 4,000,000 pesos for its plan of irrigation and power plant
                            construction. <pb n="58" xml:id="pg_58" facs="0066"/>These last two
                            items in the President’s memorandum total 3,638,000 pesos. The
                            Ambassador includes 1,000,000 pesos for navigation, not in the
                            President’s memorandum, increases the public building estimate by
                            500,000 pesos and reduces the highway item in the President’s memo by
                            712,000; as a result his total estimated requirements range from
                            10,500,000 to 11,000,000 pesos. The latter maximum figure plus the
                            military requirements would bring Colombia’s total request to 10¼
                            million dollars. However, it is worthy of comment that on the public
                            works program alone the government plans to expend an additional
                            6,000,000 pesos or $3,420,000 from internal sources. This evidences good
                            faith and is in a manner a guarantee of the soundness of the loan.</p>
                        <p>I also call attention to the Ambassador’s remarks pointing to the urgency
                            of this financial aid for the preservation of his country’s economic and
                            social equilibrium.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Turbay mentioned Argentina having received recently an interest rate
                            of 3½ percent and hopes the same may be done for Colombia.</p>
                        <p>I confirmed to Ambassador Turbay the assurances given me by President
                            Santos that since he recognized the difficulties of our position certain
                            guarantees as to exchange would be given to this loan. I said that while
                            the extension of a credit perhaps should not be made contingent on these
                            guarantees, nevertheless the following should be considered

                        <p>More detailed comment on the foregoing and on other points is given in
                            the enclosed memorandum. I do not recommend the adjustment of these
                            several matters being exacted as a <hi rend="italic">quid pro quo</hi>
                            for the granting of a loan but I do feel they should be discreetly
                            called to the attention of our Colombian friends.</p>
                        <p>I told the Ambassador that President Santos on March 28, 1941, after
                            talking with me, had summoned the Manager of the Agricultural Mortgage
                            Bank and the Mayor of Bogotá to insist to them that an attempt be made
                            promptly to accommodate their respective foreign debt situation.</p>
                        <pb n="59" xml:id="pg_59" facs="0067"/>
                        <p>Dr. Turbay acknowledged that at the time when the national debt offer had
                            been approved by the Under Secretary<note n="82" xml:id="d60fn82">Sumner
                                Welles.</note> and Messrs. Morgenthau<note n="83" xml:id="d60fn83"
                                >Henry Morgenthau, Jr., Secretary of the Treasury.</note> and
                                Jones,<note n="84" xml:id="d60fn84">Jesse H. Jones, Secretary of
                                Commerce.</note> he had promised that a representative of the
                            Agricultural Mortgage Bank would come to the United States to negotiate.
                            The Ambassador inferred that this visit had been deferred because there
                            was no one with whom he could deal, since manifestly Colombia could not
                            with dignity and self respect carry on discussions with the Foreign
                            Bondholders Protective Council, Inc.</p>
                        <p>I replied that my personal suggestion, and I had no idea of the
                            Department’s views in the premises, was for some one person to be fully
                            authorized by both the bank and the Municipality of Bogotá, to come here
                            and begin informal conversations. During the course of such discussions
                            I said perhaps a way to a formal settlement would be uncovered and at
                            least Colombia would have taken this step to indicate her good
                            faith.</p>
                        <p>Respecting the Bankers Group loan, the Ambassador said the National City
                            Bank officials had displayed scant interest to negotiate when he had
                            suggested a refunding at 3 percent and amortization of $1,000,000 per
                            year to liquidate the indebtedness in approximately 15 years.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Conclusion:</hi> The economic purposes to which the
                            larger part of this financing will be dedicated appear to be sound and
                            should improve the country’s productive capacity in several particulars.
                            The servicing of this credit probably will not be too great a burden on
                            Colombian capacity to pay. For us to lend assistance in this manner,
                            from the political and diplomatic aspect, is a worthwhile gesture. It is
                            expedient for Colombian economy to be supported by us in these times.
                            Therefore, I recommend that favorable consideration be given to this
                            project.</p>
                        <p>The 7,000,000 pesos requested for military ends is of course dependent on
                            many production and priority conditions here with which I am
                            unacquainted. However, I recommend that it might be beneficial to us in

                            consideration to be given to the following items in President Santos’

                            discussions between officers of the Department and officers of the
                            Export-Import Bank with respect to the request of the Colombian
                            Government for a credit of $6,000,000 for irrigation works, the
                            construction of highways, machinery for electrical power plant and other
                            public works. Copies of letters and memoranda from the President of
                            Colombia and from the Colombian Ambassador, as well as memoranda from
                            Ambassador Braden relating to this request, have already been made
                            available to the Export-Import Bank and to Mr. W. L. Clayton, Deputy
                            Federal Loan Administrator.</p>
                        <p>In the discussions referred to above, the view has been expressed that a
                            program of economic cooperation could proceed on a better basis if
                            certain economic problems affecting the relations between the two
                            countries were satisfactorily settled. These matters include especially
                            the handling by Colombia of its exchange control arrangements, and
                            continued attention to Colombian foreign indebtedness, following up the
                            present national debt settlement with discussions of the guaranteed and
                            local debts. The Department has already received assurances that
                            conversations will begin shortly with respect to the guaranteed
                            indebtedness. It is prepared to undertake at once and continue informal
                            discussion of the other matters, including the exchange control
                            situation, and it is confident that the Colombian Government will
                            continue to take measures for the solution of outstanding problems.</p>
                        <p>The Department has carefully examined the Colombian request for credits
                            for public works purposes and strongly recommends that the Export-Import
                            Bank make a general commitment for public works of $6,000,000,
                            individual projects to be subject as usual to the specific consideration
                            and approval of the bank.</p>

                        <p>The Colombian Ambassador stated that he had learned from Ambassador
                            Braden and Mr. Duggan that the Export-Import Bank had on May 1 adopted a
                            resolution authorizing the officers of the Bank to work out the details
                            of the credit to the Government of Colombia. The Ambassador stated that
                            he felt it a repetition of the difficulties of last year, at which time
                            he stated there was confusion between the Bank and Bogotá regarding the
                            purposes to which the credit would be put and the proportion of the
                            credit, if any, which might be used locally. Mr. Collado indicated that
                            the Executive Committee of the Bank had adopted its resolution in the
                            broadest terms leaving all such <pb n="62" xml:id="pg_62" facs="0070"
                            />details to be worked out between the Bank and the Government of
                            Colombia. Mr. Collado stated that he believed those details would be
                            worked out upon the return to Washington Sunday of Ambassador Braden.
                            Ambassador Turbay stated that he was afraid that the initial memorandum
                            of the President to Ambassador Braden,<note n="88" xml:id="d63fn88">Not
                                printed; see memorandum of April 16, by Ambassador Braden, <ref
                                    target="#pg_57">p. 57</ref>.</note> which he stated was only a
                            preliminary proposal, was not sufficiently ample and did not request
                            credits of sufficient magnitude. He stated that while that memorandum
                            requested credits of U.S.$10,000,000, U.S.$7,000,000 was needed for
                            public works, almost as much for the needs of the Ministry of Economy
                            (which needs he did not specify), or a total of perhaps U.S.$12,000,000,
                            and that in addition the Treasury wished some form of stabilization
                            operation which might require immediately an additional U.S.$3,000,000,
                            a grand total of U.S.$15,000,000.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Duggan explained to the Ambassador that we had received through
                            Ambassador Braden a memorandum of the President of Colombia and a
                            memorandum with respect to highways, irrigation projects, buildings,
                            navigation, and equipment for power plants which Ambassador Turbay had
                            submitted, and that the Department had formally requested the
                            Export-Import Bank to act with respect to the non-military sections of
                            these memoranda. Mr. Collado indicated that the memorandum of the
                            President of Colombia requested slightly over U.S.$4,000,000 for
                            military purposes, and that this had been excluded in the Department’s
                            discussions with the Export-Import Bank. The Executive Committee of the
                            Export-Import Bank had approved a credit of up to $6,000,000 and had
                            been specifically informed that no additional credits would be requested
                            by Colombia for a year or so. Mr. Duggan pointed out that the military
                            items were to be handled in a separate phase, as the Under Secretary had
                            explained to the Ambassador.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Collado went on to point out that the memoranda submitted indicated
                            7,000,000 <hi rend="italic">pesos</hi> for the public works projects and
                            that this figure plus the other figures mentioned in the detailed
                            memorandum submitted through Ambassador Turbay checked closely with the
                            item of slightly under U.S. six million <hi rend="italic">dollars</hi>
                            mentioned in the memorandum of the President of Colombia. Mr. Collado
                            further pointed out that there had been no previous mention in any of
                            the correspondence of any funds for stabilization purposes.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Turbay stated that he did not believe his Government would
                            accept a credit of less than U.S.$10,000,000 and did not seem impressed
                            with the fact that that was what they would be getting, U.S.$6,000,000
                            for public works plus the military arrangements. <pb n="63"
                                xml:id="pg_63" facs="0071"/>He produced newspaper clippings from
                            Bogotá indicating an expectation of U.S.$12,000,000 in credits. After
                            considerable discussion, it was left that no announcements would be made
                            by the Export-Import Bank, and no further action would be taken pending
                            the return from Bogotá of the Ambassador, who would present upon his
                            return the detailed requests of his Government. At that time it would be
                            decided whether it was feasible to ask the Export-Import Bank to
                            reconsider the whole matter.</p>

                        <p>145. Following Dr. Turbay’s arrival May 6, continuous and varied
                            publicity has been given to question of a loan to Colombia, <pb n="64"
                                xml:id="pg_64" facs="0072"/>news reports from Washington quoted
                            Jesse Jones to effect that a 6 million dollar Export-Import Bank loan
                            had been granted to Colombia and that no further loans were on
                            application. Confusion subsequently resulted from a statement by the
                            Colombian Minister of Finance who when questioned regarding the matter
                            declared in the press on May 8 that the amount of the new credits had
                            not been determined and would be a question for discussion in New York
                            and Washington with the Colombian Ambassador who was receiving precise
                            instructions thereon.</p>
                        <p>Still further on May 9th Turbay declared to the press <quote

                                <p>“The data published regarding the amount and terms of the
                                    projected loan of the Export-Import Bank are absolutely without
                                    foundation. It is evident that before my trip to this country I
                                    discussed with the appropriate parties certain aspects of the
                                    loan which will be concluded and which constitutes a part of the
                                    program of economic cooperation by the United States. My
                                    presence here has precisely as its objective to agree with the
                                    Government on the specific bases for the negotiations and
                                    certain details of the program for the corresponding
                                    allocations. To which end I have initiated the necessary study
                                    with the Ministries of Finance, Public Works, National Economy
                                    and War. The versions which may be published are solely based on
                                    supposition as the definitive program is being completed
                                    precisely at this time.</p>
                                <p>As a result of the negotiations up to now I believe I can affirm
                                    that on my return negotiations will be concluded in a short time
                                    in a satisfactory form.”</p>

                        <p>Today there is published under a Washington date line an Associated Press
                            despatch that a well informed source has reiterated that Colombia
                            requested a credit of 6 million which was conceded promptly, and added
                            that there is no pending request for more credit.</p>
                        <p>Considerable editorial space has been devoted to this subject and has
                            been in a vein to create the expectation that more than 6 million would
                            be forthcoming.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Turbay and Secretary General of the Foreign Office were at my
                            house yesterday and neither they nor I made any reference to the
                            loan.</p>
                        <p>This morning the President summoned me both to give me certain
                            information on another subject I had previously requested and obviously
                            also to speak in strict confidence of the confusion which had resulted
                            from the press publicity regarding the amount of the loan. In view of
                            this and that certain factors had changed since he and the Ambassador
                            had last discussed the matter he said he would appreciate my informing
                            the Ambassador as he passes through Barranquilla that he would be
                            grateful if no mention were made regarding the amount of the loan until
                            he had had an opportunity personally <pb n="65" xml:id="pg_65"

                            who will arrive there May 14, and of the Ambassador here the issue can,
                            aided by their presence, be resolved with avoidance of public
                            misunderstanding. Already today there is a tendency to let the issue
                            subside in the shadow of the news regarding the bonded debt conversion
                            and the efforts of Turbay towards Liberal Party unity. The whole problem

                        <p>The Ambassador of Colombia handed me the memoranda attached.<note n="96"
                                xml:id="d68fn96">Not printed.</note> These memoranda set forth the
                            desire of the Colombian Government to obtain a credit from the
                            Export-Import Bank of $13,000,000 for various types of public works and
                            for a small addition to the capital of the stabilization fund. The
                            Ambassador stated that, in so far as the Colombian Government could now
                            state after a careful study of its needs, a credit of $13,000,000 would
                            take care of all of its requirements for the remainder of the present
                            calendar year and for the entire calendar year 1942.</p>
                        <p>Regarding terms, which are not treated in the memorandum, the Ambassador
                            stated that his Government had heard that terms of longer than ten years
                            were being offered to Cuba and that the Government of Colombia would
                            like to have similar treatment; in fact, terms of longer than ten years
                            would be necessary since the Government, <pb n="67" xml:id="pg_67"
                                facs="0075"/>given the debt payments it had agreed to make, would be
                            unable to liquidate a credit of $13,000,000 in ten years. In reply to my
                            inquiry as to what terms the Government had in mind the Ambassador said
                            an interest rate of 3 percent and an annual amortization payment of
                            $750,000. I told the Ambassador that no long term credit had been given
                            for as low an interest rate as 3 percent and that I was quite certain
                            that the Bank would not agree to an interest rate of that amount.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador stated that he wished to make it clear that all of the
                            public works which are mentioned in the documentation are now in process
                            of execution. They are not new projects to be undertaken if a credit is
                            obtained but projects which the Government, with its own funds,
                            undertook but which cannot be carried to completion because of a
                            reduction in Government revenues. Customs collections are now running a
                            million pesos a month below budget estimates It has been necessary to
                            curtail work on some of the projects and some projects are about to be
                            temporarily halted for lack of funds. If funds become available through
                            an Export-Import Bank credit, work could be immediately resumed.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador also stated that the completion of some of the public
                            buildings mentioned in the documentation was very important since rent
                            to the value of 200,000 pesos would be saved if the Government could
                            occupy its own buildings. The Ambassador stated that he had a tabulation
                            setting forth the rents that the Government was now paying which would
                            be eliminated were public buildings now under construction to be
                            completed. At my request, the Ambassador stated that he would send a
                            copy of this tabulation.</p>
                        <p>I told the Ambassador that the Department would give this request of the
                            Colombian Government for additional funds its immediate consideration
                            and would immediately confer with the Export-Import Bank. In as much as
                            the documents he left were in Spanish, I told the Ambassador that it
                            might be necessary to have some of them translated for the officers of
                            the Export-Import Bank. This would take time. I stated that I hoped,
                            however, to be able to advise him in the early days of next week of the
                            time of a meeting between himself, officers of the Bank, and officers of
                            this Department.</p>

                            economic basis, that our largesse should not be given all at once, that
                            Colombians should be made to understand it is not merely an easily
                            obtained handout and that they must reciprocate in every way.</p>
                        <p>Yesterday President and Minister of Finance separately informed me
                            negotiations were proceeding very satisfactorily in Washington and they
                            expected closing before June 15. Latter added thanks to me for obtaining
                            approval $6,000,000 credit since thereby they were assured of at least
                            that amount. They stated Turbay had proposed $7,000,000 for this year,
                            $5,000,000 for 1942 and [$] 1,000,000 for 1943.</p>
                        <p>I shall, of course, comment in full on receipt of Colombian memorandum
                            but my preliminary impressions are:</p>
                        <p>Loans for banana district, irrigation and drainage, prudent amount for
                            highways and navigation if it be for improvement of Dique or other sound
                            projects appear reasonable. Municipal development fund is loosely run
                            and any advance should be for carefully scrutinized specific projects
                            and then only for import requirements. Industrial Development Institute
                            is unproven; of two and two-thirds million pesos paid—in capital two
                            million is from last year’s loan; only 547,000 pesos so far invested in
                            new projects none of which are known to be functioning; hence need now
                            for further capital is questionable and any advances should be subject
                            to approval of detailed plans. No advance for hydroelectric plants which
                            could remotely compete with those now operated by American capital
                            should be countenanced.</p>
                        <p>Over 75 percent gold reserve on note circulation and other present
                            favorable factors indicate nothing required now for stabilization fund,
                            which has been profitable organization and I would favor advance only
                            when actual need appears. President claims construction of public
                            buildings will bring great saving in present rentals but here again
                            scrutiny is desirable.</p>
                        <p>In final analysis request for additional loan appears to be motivated in
                            large measure by Lopez attacks alleging Santos was not getting enough
                            from us. Therefore to help latter over this obstacle some earmarking
                            along the lines requested by Turbay may be acceptable always provided it
                            is thoroughly understood by Colombians that money will be handed over
                            only after completely detailed and satisfactory plans have been
                            approved.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: Reference is made to my
                            letter of April 23, 1941 recommending the extension by the Export-Import
                            Bank of a credit of $6,000,000 to the Government of Colombia, and to Mr.
                            Will Clayton’s letter of May 12, stating that such a credit had been
                            extended and indicating certain outstanding economic problems which it
                            is deemed desirable be taken up simultaneously with the Government of
                            Colombia. Reference is also made to a memorandum of the Colombian
                            Ministry of Finance subsequently submitted by the Colombian Ambassador,
                            and to conversations between the Ambassador, Mr. Warren L. Pierson,
                            President of the Export-Import Bank, and officers of the Department.</p>
                        <p>The Colombian memorandum mentioned, copies of which have been made
                            available to the Export-Import Bank, requests the Export-Import Bank to
                            consider a broader program, involving projects to be carried out through
                            the end of 1942, which would require the extension of credits of up to
                            $13,000,000. The Colombian Ambassador has indicated that his Government
                            requests and would need as favorable terms as possible, including low
                            rates of interest and amortization spaced over a period of more than ten
                            years.</p>
                        <p>The Department has carefully considered the additional projects listed,
                            has discussed them with appropriate agencies of this Government, and
                            believes that they would represent useful undertakings necessary and
                            desirable in the maintenance and improvement of the Colombian economy.
                            The Department therefore recommends that the Export-Import Bank as soon
                            as conveniently possible consider the increase of the present credit to
                            the Colombian Government of $6,000,000 to one of $13,000,000, at the
                            Bank’s regular interest terms of four percent and with amortization
                            handled in a manner similar to that provided in the recent credit of
                            $25,000,000 to the Government of Cuba. Each individual project would of
                            course be subject to the approval of the Bank, and all supplying of
                            machinery and equipment would be carried out with due regard to the
                            exigencies of our national defense program.</p>

                        <p>138. Conversations have taken place between the Export-Import Bank, the
                            Department and Ambassador Turbay regarding the Colombian request for
                            additional credits. The Bank has already offered to increase the credit
                            to $10,000,000 and the Department continues to press for $12,000,000.
                            The matter should be clarified within a few days.</p>
                        <p>The Colombian request included 2 million Colombian pesos for the
                            stabilization fund. The Department, the Export-Import Bank, and the
                            Treasury believe that this is a proper matter for discussion with the
                            Treasury Department, and Ambassador Turbay has been informed of this
                            opinion. He has stated that he would consult his Government for
                            instructions whether to proceed with stabilization discussions with the
                            Treasury Department.</p>

                        <p>197. For Duggan. Department’s 138, June 5. I consider it essential
                            insofar as possible that Export-Import Bank obtain commitments from
                            Turbay to adjust several matters mentioned in Clayton’s <pb n="71"
                                xml:id="pg_71" facs="0079"/>letter to Under Secretary of May 12
                            forwarded with Department’s instruction no. 699<note n="99"

                            also mention of desirability for reform in petroleum law. Moreover I
                            feel that of ten to twelve million to be loaned no more than six or
                            seven million should be made available this year and balance should be
                            earmarked for next year.</p>
                        <p>In connection with foregoing and referring to my telegram No. 160 of May
                                19<note n="1" xml:id="d73fn1">Not printed.</note> am reliably

                            products were not included in the list attached to report number 515 of

                                [<hi rend="italic">June?</hi>] 5 added a number of articles to the
                            already ample list of products which can be imported from Japan on free
                            exchange basis, among those were porcelain ware, buttons, wool yarn and
                            additional agricultural machinery. All of this has been done under the
                            guise of obtaining raw materials for national industry but only a part
                            of the products exempted from compensation may be so classified and the
                            balance are obtainable without undue delay in the United States.</p>
                        <p>As stated in my telegram No. 160, it is definitely against our interests
                            to use exchange resulting from American purchases and loans to stimulate
                            sale of Japanese manufactured and consumer goods thus indirectly
                            supplying Japan with foreign exchange and giving them opening in this
                            market from which it will be difficult to dislodge them. I urge we be
                            adamant in not lending a cent until Colombia is committed to confining
                            Japan to a bona fide trade basis. In other words, this country in all
                            fairness should only purchase from Japan those articles which cannot be
                            obtained in the United States.</p>
                        <p>While I have repeatedly in a discreet manner broached matters discussed
                            in paragraph No. 1 above to the authorities here, I have not recently
                            touched upon the Japanese because several important persons appear to be
                            getting side commissions thereon whereas bank can discuss all these
                            situations without embarrassment. Consequently in view of defense and
                            necessity for maintaining cordial relations with the Colombian
                            authorities by the Department and this Embassy, I recommend
                            Export-Import Bank assume all responsibility for the presentation of and
                            insistence on all our aforementioned requirements.</p>

                        <p>145. The Export-Import Bank on June 6 approved a resolution for the
                            extension of credits of up to $12,000,000 to Colombia, all specific
                            projects to be subject to the approval of the Bank. Details will be
                            worked out with Ambassador Turbay.</p>
                        <p>The Bank will again request the Department to take up with the Colombian
                            Government the several issues regarding exchange control, the dollar
                            indebtedness of the Agricultural Mortgage Bank and the Municipality of
                            Bogotá, and so forth, of which you are aware. The Bank expects that
                            these will be settled to our satisfaction, but will not include them as
                            specific conditions to the credit.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Turbay has indicated that his Government is interested in
                            having him discuss with the Treasury a possible monetary or
                            stabilization operation, and the Department has requested the Treasury
                            Department to go into the matter. The Secretary of the Treasury will see
                            Turbay early in the week, and preliminary discussions will begin then,
                            although the Treasury cannot move rapidly until legislation now pending
                            for the extension of the Stabilization Fund beyond June 30, 1941 is
                            adopted. The Treasury has asked a number of specific questions regarding
                            points of the Colombian exchange arrangements not entirely clarified in
                            the recent excellent reporting of the Embassy: <list>

                        <p>208. An agreement was signed July 23 between the Colombian Ambassador and
                            the Export-Import Bank establishing a line of credit not in excess of
                            $12,000,000 in favor of the Republic of Colombia. Sums drawn against
                            this line of credit will bear 4% interest and must be amortized on a
                            semi-annual basis within 12 years. The credit may be availed of at any
                            time up to December 31, 1945.</p>

                        <p>223. Reference is made to the Department’s telegram no. 210 of July 25, 9
                            p.m., and to your reply no. 299 of July 28, 9 p.m.<note n="3"

                            Department handed Turbay a draft agreement between the Colombian
                            Stabilization Fund, the Bank of the Republic, and the Government of
                            Colombia on the one hand, and the Secretary of the Treasury of the
                            United States on the other, providing for a $3,000,000 stabilization
                            fund operation. A full copy of this draft agreement is going forward to
                            you air mail but in as much as Turbay leaves Washington this afternoon
                            by airplane for Bogotá where he should arrive the morning of August 2,
                            it is thought that certain details would be of interest to you.</p>
                        <p>The draft agreement itself in paragraph 6 thereof includes certain
                            commitments on the part of Colombia with a view to maintaining stability
                            of the United States dollar-Colombian peso rate of exchange; that no
                            important change will be made in the Colombian exchange control system
                            without an opportunity for consultation by the United States; that
                            diligence will be exercised by Colombia in the issuance of import
                            permits and exchange approvals to avoid in so far as possible undue
                            delays in payments for imports from the United States or in other
                            remittances to the United States.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador Turbay was told that these commitments were in continuation of
                            the conversations you had already held successfully with the Minister of
                            Finance on related subjects. For the most part it only summarized what
                            the Minister had already told you but in explanation of point 4 which
                            had not been presented by you to the Minister of Finance in just that
                            form, he was told that the United States obviously could not mention
                            Germany, Japan, or Italy in a formal note of this kind but that the
                            Department wished to have point 4 on record so that if any later
                            questions were asked by the press or in Congress the Department would be
                            in a position adequately to answer these inquiries or attacks. Dr.
                            Turbay was told that this Department was very happy to recommend that
                            the Treasury authorize the $3,000,000 stabilization amount in view of
                            Colombia’s fine cooperation with us, but for the sake of the record had
                            to have something to stand on. Turbay offered no objection and seemed
                            very happy about the whole affair.</p>
                        <p>This information is being sent in order that you may be fully informed
                            should Turbay or the Minister of Finance raise the subject.</p>
                        <p>It was considered inadvisable in these stabilization discussions to bring
                            up the subject of the Agricultural Mortgage Bank, the petroleum laws, or
                            the corporation law since you had already adequately covered these
                            points in your talks with the Minister of Finance.</p>

                        <p>Dr. Salazar called at our request to receive a reply to his memorandum
                            dated September 30<note n="6" xml:id="d78fn6">Not printed.</note> in
                            which he had proposed possible bases for the settlement of the
                            Government-guaranteed Agricultural Mortgage Bank bonds and the
                            non-guaranteed dollar bonds of that institution.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Salazar was told that the Department, the Foreign Bondholders’
                            Protective Council, and the bondholders themselves were anxious for a
                            settlement which would reinforce confidence in Colombia and its credit.
                            The Department had studied his memorandum and had certain informal
                            comments to make. The Department could not act as a negotiator but would
                            be glad to cooperate with him with a view to arriving at some solution
                            which might form the basis for a satisfactory offer by the Bank to the
                            bondholders. One very important series of information which was missing
                            and which we wish to obtain as soon as possible was the breakdown of the
                            item given on <ref target="#pg_6">Page 6</ref> of his memorandum as
                            “valores diversos” of 22,812,354.20 pesos. It is pointed out that
                            included in this sum was an undetermined amount of various of the Bank’s
                            outstanding bonds. Unless we all knew just what these bonds were and in
                            what amounts, our discussions could not proceed along any accurate
                            course. Dr. Salazar promised to obtain this information as soon as
                            possible.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Salazar was told that, still speaking informally, it was considered
                            highly doubtful that the bondholders could accept, or that this
                            Department could give any approval to, a settlement less favorable than
                            the 3 percent settlement made on the bonds of the Republic of Colombia.
                            The Agricultural Mortgage Bank bonds had been guaranteed by the Republic
                            of Colombia; the Bank was a semi-official organization and, even
                            admitting that the Bank had lost much of its capital and other assets,
                            the bondholders and the public in this country would look to the
                            guarantor for service in the event that the principals, in this case the
                            Bank, were unable to pay. It was pointed out that the Department had
                            been glad to lend its good offices in the settlement of <pb n="76"
                                xml:id="pg_76" facs="0084"/>the bonds of the national Government and
                            if it were then to acquiesce in a less favorable settlement for a
                            Government-guaranteed issue, its position would be an untenable one in
                            the face of questions from bondholders, the public, or political sources
                            as to why the Department of State could on one day say 3 percent could
                            be paid by Colombia, on the next day loan Colombia $10,000,000 through
                            the Export-Import Bank, then subsequently loan Colombia another
                            $12,000,000 from the Export-Import Bank, and on the heels of this say
                            Colombia was only capable of paying 2½ percent. Dr. Salazar readily
                            recognized this position but stated that there were considerations in
                            Colombia which rendered it difficult to make a settlement more favorable
                            than the 2½ percent one he had offered. He finally said that his
                            instructions were clearly limited to a settlement on a 2½ percent basis
                            with the back interest to be forgiven. On the non-guaranteed bonds he
                            could offer only equal or rather similar treatment, in any case not less
                            favorable treatment than that extended to Lazard Brothers on the
                            Sterling issues.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Salazar was told that the only way the Department could come into
                            this discussion was because of the Government guarantee. Had it been a
                            private bond issue with private holders, we would never have entered the
                            discussions. The bondholders and the public here took the position that
                            the Bank being a semi-governmental organization and its bonds having
                            been guaranteed by the Government should not be treated as a private
                            organization and when the Bank could not pay, the Government should. Dr.
                            Salazar said that he recognized the logic and legal aspects of this
                            argument and would present it to his principals.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Salazar assured us that in no instance would the non-guaranteed bonds
                            receive treatment less favorable than that accorded the Lazard
                            settlement. As a matter of fact, there was a possibility that the
                            treatment might be slightly more favorable since the Bank might wish to
                            issue a larger percentage of American bonds in dollars and not in pesos,
                            as was the case for the Sterling bonds, and reduce the rate of interest
                            to 3 percent instead of 4 percent as was paid on the Sterling ones. Thus
                            the non-guaranteed dollar bonds would continue in dollars at a lowered
                            principal amount and at 3 percent interest instead of 4 percent, but
                            since a larger amount of the bonds would be given in dollars than was
                            given in pesos for the Sterling bonds, the net return to the American
                            bondholders would be essentially the same with the added advantage in
                            having their obligation in dollars instead of pesos.</p>
                        <p>We discussed with Dr. Salazar the possible advisability of the Bank’s
                            lumping the non-guaranteed and the guaranteed bonds into a single
                            refunding issue all bearing the same rate of interest. Since the Bank
                            already contemplated refunding the non-guaranteed bonds in dollar bonds
                            and not in peso ones, this would be simple. Each would carry the same
                            rate of interest and consequently there was no reason <pb n="77"
                                xml:id="pg_77" facs="0085"/>why the guaranteed bonds could not be
                            lumped dollar for dollar with the non-guaranteed bonds at a percentage
                            to be agreed upon and have the combined new issue carry 3 percent. This
                            could have the advantage to the bondholder of having only one bond
                            quoted on the market and should facilitate trading. The advantage would
                            result to the Bank of having only one issue which would be more easily
                            controlled and which would be more readily marketable since there would
                            be a single quotation for the bond instead of a high quotation for the
                            principal issue and a low quotation for the subordinate issue.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Salazar said that he was anxious to leave for Colombia in February
                            and he would take this matter up immediately with his principals and
                            hoped to arrive at some settlement.</p>
                        <p>The meeting was throughout cordial and Dr. Salazar exhibited a most
                            cooperative attitude although he made it unquestionably clear that his
                            activities were distinctly limited by the instructions he had
                            received.</p>

                                <item>During my visit last April to Washington National City Bank
                                    officers expressed the hope indebtedness to their group might be
                                    liquidated by means of an Export-Import Bank loan to Colombia. I
                                    stated to them my personal opinion that such an operation was
                                    out of the question.</item>
                                <label>(3)</label>
                                <item>Also while I was in Washington Turbay informed me he had
                                    tentatively suggested to the group that credit be settled on
                                    terms mentioned in Department’s telegram under reference. I
                                    intimated to him that bankers probably ask better conditions, as
                                    for instance a fixed annual payment of approximately $1,450,000
                                    (to include 3% interest) until extinguished. Later I informed
                                    Rentschler and Schoepple of National City Bank and Baker and
                                    Goodhue of Bank of Manhattan Company of my conversation with
                                    Colombian Ambassador and I expressed my personal opinion that
                                    this was about maximum Colombian budget would stand. Also in
                                    reply to questions by these bankers I observed that only way to
                                    get a settlement was actively to pursue negotiations. This
                                    apparently they have been reluctant to do and the Colombian
                                    Government is content to have this matter run along as it has
                                    for years past.</item>

                        <p>551. My telegram No. 546, November 10, 10 p.m. Manager of National City
                            Bank advises me that about 2 months ago he received a letter from the
                            Minister of Finance in which the latter confirmed a previous promise to
                            endeavor to obtain congressional authorization for the settlement of the
                            group loan and to include $500,000 for amortization in 1942 budget. The
                            Minister has done neither so far but in this letter he includes a
                            self-serving declaration to the effect that the group had been unwilling
                            last January to negotiate.</p>
                        <p>The manager and bank attorney feel it is important to recommit the
                            Minister definitely to his promise and simultaneously to make clear that
                            they by no means refused to negotiate. I entirely concur with their
                            judgment in this particular. However, the New York Office of the bank
                            appears reluctant to take this action.</p>
                        <p>I have expressed my purely personal opinion to the manager as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>If by so recommitting the Minister negotiations were to be opened they
                            would have to be handled carefully to avoid placing the group <pb n="79"
                                xml:id="pg_79" facs="0087"/>in a bad trading position as for
                            instance if they agreed to minimum terms with the Santos Government but
                            the deal were not made legally binding the new administration which
                            takes office next August might try to obtain still further reductions.
                            On the other hand Lopez, in expectancy of his being the next President,
                            might be glad to have Santos assume the responsibility for the
                            settlement and accordingly might lend the necessary congressional
                            support to conclude the matter.</p>
                        <p>I shall take an appropriate opportunity in the near future to renew my
                            discussion of this affair with the President and Minister of
                            Finance.</p>

                        <p>582. Department’s telegram number 434, November 24, 11 p.m. Draft budget
                            for year beginning January 1, 1942, involves no increase in service
                            charges over present year and Minister of Finance therefore believes it
                            will easily pass whereas to attempt to obtain amortization of $500,000
                            for 1942 might precipitate debate which due to congressional adjournment
                            within next 4 weeks might imperil entire authorization.</p>

                        <p>445. Your 582, November 26, 1 p.m. Counsel of the National City Bank has
                            called the attention of the Department to draft legislation <pb n="81"
                                xml:id="pg_81" facs="0089"/>pending in the Colombian Congress which
                            would empower the Finance Minister to make a settlement of this matter
                            on the basis of 3 percent interest and 10-year amortization. The
                            legislation, described as “Article 17” is reported to have been read at
                            least once already in the Lower House with final action expected by next
                            week.</p>
                        <p>In view of this expected legislation and general hopefulness of the
                            Bank’s Colombian branch managers, the Bank is prepared to agree to an
                            extension for 6 months to May 31, 1942 at the present rate of interest
                            and with $100,000 amortization—that is, half of the $200,000 annual
                            amortization provided in the proposed budget.</p>
                        <p>During the 6 months period negotiations would take place under the
                            above-mentioned pending legislation for a permanent settlement. The Bank
                            would be prepared to settle on the basis of total annual payments of
                            approximately $1,435,000 including interest at 3 percent. During the
                            first year this would provide an amortization of approximately
                            $1,000,000, which would be stepped up as the amount needed for interest
                            diminished. In addition to this basis of settlement, the Bank would
                            require that in the first year there be an additional payment of
                            $500,000 which the Bank states has been promised to it but not carried
                            out.</p>

                        <p>593. Department’s telegram No. 445, November 29, 4 p.m. Pending
                            legislation provides that during 1942 amortization payments should not
                            exceed those received during 1941. Thereafter amortization could amount
                            to one million dollars or more per year, always providing no less than
                            10 years were taken for extinguishment of debt.</p>
                        <p>While it is true that $500,000 payment was discussed for 1942, this is
                            not provided for in draft legislation which has already passed Lower
                            House and an attempt now to get this additional $300,000 for 1942 might
                            imperil entire project.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to my despatch
                            No. 2921 of February 18, 1941,<note n="1" xml:id="d89fn1">Not
                                printed.</note> wherein I reported the possibility of the scuttling
                            of German ships at Puntarenas harbor in the event we should become
                            involved in war.</p>
                        <p>Yesterday the British Chargé d’Affaires<note n="2" xml:id="d89fn2">George
                                Lyall.</note> called at the Legation to advise me as to the
                            seriousness of the situation and asked my advice as to what he should
                            do, or what I might be able to do, in regard to the matter. He was told
                            that inasmuch as I represent a neutral country I found myself, in the
                            absence of instructions, unable to take the matter up with either the
                                President<note n="3" xml:id="d89fn3">Rafael Angel Calderón
                                Guardia.</note> or the Foreign Office, but because he represented a
                            belligerent country I thought it quite proper for him in his capacity as
                            British Chargé to make representations in regard to the matter. I
                            suggested to him that at a cocktail party which was to be held on the
                            same evening at the Union Club in honor of the wife of the President of
                            Peru, he would have an opportunity to meet the President of the Republic
                            and the various Cabinet officers, at which time the matter could be
                            discussed informally with them. He called this morning to advise me he
                            had taken it up with three Cabinet officers and with don Luis
                                Anderson,<note n="4" xml:id="d89fn4">Authority on international law

                            while he received no definite assurances as to whether or not the Costa
                            Rican Government is prepared to wink at the law of nations and remove
                            the crews from these vessels he was hopeful something might be done.</p>
                        <p>I told him that in the absence of instructions from the Department I
                            could be of no material aid in the matter, but with his permission <pb
                                n="83" xml:id="pg_83" facs="0091"/>I would report to the Department
                            that he had held certain discussions with Costa Rican officials
                            pertaining to the situation.</p>
                        <p>I should appreciate it if I could be advised as to whether or not the

                                in front of the pier. He said that Costa Rica could not prevent this
                                action as it was in a position to do nothing but hold up its hands
                                and ask them to stop if the crews tried to scuttle the ships.</p>
                            <p>The Foreign Minister made these remarks presumably because of
                                representations made to him by the British Chargé d’Affaires in San
                                José.</p>

                            five members of his Cabinet are in favor of taking over immediately the
                                <hi rend="italic">Fella</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Eisenach</hi>
                            at Puntarenas and that the opposing member of the Cabinet is the
                            Minister of Foreign Affairs, Albert Echandi.</p>
                        <p>I was also informed this morning by the British Chargé that he had made
                            representations to the Costa Rican Government and had obtained a
                            favorable reaction.</p>
                        <p>The Legation was informed that the President would seek an interview with
                            me for the purpose of discussing [apparent omission]. I had been
                            expecting the President to communicate with me this afternoon, but I now
                            learn that a member of the Military Attaché’s office was called by
                            telephone this afternoon to come to the office of the Chief of Staff who
                            told him that the Government had decided to take possession of these
                            ships. Shortly afterwards the Minister of Public Safety entered the
                            office of the Chief of Staff and repeated that the Costa Rican
                            Government had decided to take possession of these ships and was
                            attempting to devise a plan by which this can be done without giving the
                            crews an opportunity of scuttling them.</p>
                        <p>The Legation understands action contemplated is a police or public
                            security measure based upon persistent rumors that the ships are to be
                            scuttled.</p>

                        <p>50. Referring to my telegram No. 49 of March 26, 8 p.m., I was summoned
                            by the President of the Republic this afternoon to discuss plans for
                            preventing scuttling of the German and Italian ships in Puntarenas
                            harbor.</p>
                        <p>I informed the President that I had no instructions from my Government on
                            this subject, but that I would be glad to comply with his request and
                            ascertain if on the day that his police assumed possession of these
                            ships the United States Government would be kind enough to instruct an
                            American gunboat to arrive casually in the harbor of Puntarenas, for the
                            moral effect of the same.</p>
                        <p>He also inquired as to whether or not the proposed action of taking over
                            these ships might embarrass the United States with Germany and Italy and
                            said that if the Department of State objected to his so doing he would
                            refrain from taking such action.</p>
                        <p>He is very much of the opinion that the two ships are a menace to the
                            harbor and believes that some drastic action should be taken
                            immediately. <pb n="85" xml:id="pg_85" facs="0093"/>He furthermore
                            requested me to advise the Department by cable of his plans and to
                            advise him immediately of the Department’s reaction.</p>
                        <p>I await the Department’s telegraphic instructions.</p>

                        <p>43. Your telegram no. 49, March 26, 8 p.m. and no. 50, March 27, 6 p.m.
                            Please inform the President of Costa Rica that this Government shares
                            his concern regarding the two foreign vessels at Puntarenas. The problem
                            involved is one to which this Government has been giving the most
                            careful study and in regard to which it is hoped in the relatively near
                            future to determine upon a policy. As soon as any determination is
                            reached, it is planned to inform the Costa Rican Government and the
                            Governments of other interested American republics, in order that this
                            Government may obtain the benefit of their views. You should suggest to
                            the Costa Rican authorities the desirability of not taking any specific
                            steps in this matter other than those which are merely precautionary
                            pending further developments.</p>

                            submitted to them they advised me that they propose to take possession
                            of both German and Italian ships tomorrow. They requested that if an
                            American destroyer or gunboat is in the proximity of Puntarenas it be
                            despatched there immediately. They fear that they will be unable to
                            prevent the ships from being scuttled and blocking the harbor because
                            they lack technical advice which a United States naval vessel could
                            confidentially give them. The President also asserted that the moral
                            effect of the presence of such a vessel would be helpful. Substance

                                rend="italic">Eisenach</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Fella</hi>,
                            recently burned and sunk at Puntarenas were being held in custody in the
                            penitentiary, and to the Legation’s despatch No. 3037 of April 3,
                                1941,<note n="10" xml:id="d97fn11">Not printed.</note> in which fear
                            was expressed that the Costa Rican Government cannot be depended upon to
                            keep the members of these crews in custody.</p>
                        <p>I now have the honor to report that the situation here seems to be
                            undergoing a change in respect to the attitude of this Government toward
                            these crews and present indications are that the Government will adopt
                            rigid measures to hold them in custody, and that they are to be brought
                            to trial. The Legation has been informed that the members of the crew of
                            each of the ships have been charged with arson and wilful obstruction of
                            navigation, with the additional charge of “disobedience of orders” in
                            the case of the crew of the German ship.</p>
                        <p>According to the local press, in statements published today, declarations
                            made before the investigating judge hearing the case discloses that both
                            captains declared that they had received orders to burn their ships and
                            that the order had been confirmed to the captain of the <hi
                                rend="italic">Eisenach</hi> by the German Legation in San José. The
                            press also stated that, taking into consideration the points brought out
                            in the hearing, the judge decreed the prisoners detention, to be held
                            for trial on the charges brought against them, which constitute an
                            attempt against public security.</p>

                        <p>82. Referring to Department’s telegram No. 60, April 25, 5 p.m. the

                            and his brother, the Minister of Government and Public Safety, who
                            expressed gratification at the interest of our Government and the effort
                            being made to find a plan to handle the situation. They are anxiously
                            awaiting information as to any plan which the Government of the United
                            States may be able to work out.</p>
                        <p>Referring to your telegram No. 61 of April 25, 6 p.m.,<note n="12"
                                xml:id="d99fn12">Not printed.</note> I was informed by the Minister
                            of Government and Public Safety that the court procedure in this case is
                            as follows:</p>
                        <p>There are three stages, the first known as investigation in which the
                            judge receives the sworn statements of witnesses and defendants. This is
                            limited to not exceeding 30 days but in the present instance this period
                            is already closed and the case has entered the second stage during which
                            not to exceed 50 days is permitted in which to submit and receive
                            proofs. The case then passes the third stage of [omission?] or judgment
                            which may be rendered at any time after reaching that state. The
                            procedure of open trial as known in the United States is not followed
                            under the laws of Costa Rica.</p>
                        <p>In the meantime an appeal may be made for the release of the prisoners
                            under bond. In the present case such an appeal has been made and will be
                            decided next week.</p>

                        <p>95. In an interview with the President of Costa Rica this evening I
                            brought the matter contained in the Department’s telegram No. 68, May
                            13, 7 p.m. to his attention and urged that he take this opportunity to
                            discharge the Costa Rican Government’s responsibility in the
                            premises.</p>
                        <p>The President requests that he be given the assurance of the Department
                            that the seamen will be permitted to be embarked in the Canal Zone for
                            Japan since the men are [under?] the jurisdiction of the Costa Rican
                            Courts and he must give this assurance to the court before he can issue
                            a decree of expulsion and repatriation. With the Department’s pledge
                            that these seamen will be permitted to proceed to Japan when a Japanese
                            boat is available the President will, I am sure, carry out the plan
                            outlined in the telegram referred to above.</p>
                        <p>I feel that the Costa Rican Government has compromised itself with the
                            German Minister not to turn over these men to the United States
                            authorities for concentration and has promised that they will be
                            deported to Japan (see my despatch No. 3143 of May 2nd, 1941<note n="13"
                                xml:id="d101fn13">Not printed.</note>).</p>
                        <p>I shall see the President at 10 a.m., May 14, and should like to give him
                            the Department’s reply at that time. Urgently request telegraphic reply
                            is therefore requested.</p>

                        <p>101. The substance of the Department’s telegram No. 73 of May 16, 11 a.m.
                            has been orally discussed with the Foreign Minister and at his request
                            placed in a note which has now been delivered to him. He informs me that
                            he will this afternoon reply in writing setting forth his understanding
                            of the arrangement, the status of the seamen during their presence in
                            the Canal Zone and their privilege to embark on the first available
                            Japanese steamer. Upon receipt of his written understanding it will be
                            communicated immediately to the Department for its comment and further
                            instructions.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister will this afternoon endeavor to obtain the approval
                            of the German and Italian diplomatic representatives in order that the
                            expenses involved may be covered by those Governments. In case of
                            failure to obtain their approval, the Minister states the plan will have
                            to be carried out at the expense of the Costa Rican Government.</p>

                        <p>124. In compliance with Department’s telegram No. 87 of May 27, 6
                                p.m.<note n="15" xml:id="d104fn15">Not printed.</note> I called on
                            the President and made inquiry in the sense indicated. He informed me
                            that he himself did not give any assurance to the German and Italian
                            diplomatic representatives but that the Foreign Minister gave them the
                            assurances of his Government that the <pb n="91" xml:id="pg_91"
                                facs="0099"/>United States Government would place no obstacle in the
                            way of the men being permitted to embark for Japan by the first
                            available Japanese vessel calling in the Zone. He explained that the
                            assurance given by the executive branch to the Axis diplomats was to
                            avoid difficulties with the judicial branch of the Government because
                            Costa Rica could not legally turn over these men to another
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>President Calderón Guardia referred to the decree issued on May 20 which
                            grants general amnesty to the crews under the condition that they
                            abandon Costa Rican territory immediately and not remain in any
                            neighboring republic through which they must pass en route to Japan, and
                            that they defray their expenses for their return to their homelands.</p>
                        <p>The President added that of course if the German and/or the Italian
                            Governments make no efforts to have the seamen embark for Japan within a
                            reasonable time, either by Japanese vessel or by a ship of another
                            nationality, the assurances given by the Costa Rican Government would
                            naturally no longer be applicable.</p>
                        <p>I have no information as to what arrangements the Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs may have made with the German and Italian diplomats concerning
                            the steps to be taken by their Governments to have the men transported
                            to Japan, but the decree of amnesty mentioned above would indicate that
                            Italy and/or Germany agreed to have the seamen repatriated at the
                            expense of their Governments and without cost to the Costa Rican
                            Government.</p>

                            add that in accordance with the position taken by the Costa Rican
                            Government vis-à-vis the German and Italian Ministers the seamen were
                            not only given the chance to depart on the first Japanese vessel calling
                            in the Canal Zone but also when it was ascertained that such Japanese
                            vessel would be unable to accommodate the seamen, arrangements were made
                            for their transportation from the Canal Zone to San Francisco where they
                            will be given another chance to sail on the first Japanese ship calling
                            at that port. The seamen are at this moment en route from the Canal Zone
                            to San Francisco.</p>
                        <p>Please make it clear that this Government will of course continue to
                            support the position taken by the Government of Costa Rica in this
                            matter.</p>

                        <p>135. Department’s telegram number 96 dated June 5, midnight. I called on
                            the Foreign Minister this morning to inform him of the contents of the
                            Department’s above-cited telegram. I found him with Anderson and was
                            asked if Don Anderson might remain to discuss the matter, to which I
                            consented.</p>
                        <p>Prior to my interview with the Minister for Foreign Affairs he had
                            already spoken with the President on the subject. Also, the President
                            had asked the Legation if it had any information concerning the transfer
                            of the seamen from the Canal Zone, since it appears <pb n="93"
                                xml:id="pg_93" facs="0101"/>that he had heard the news last night by
                            radio from Panama and had read it in this morning’s newspapers. At the
                            time of the President’s inquiry this morning the Department’s message
                            had not yet been completely decoded and he was informed that while the
                            Legation had received a telegram from the Department on the subject, its
                            contents were as yet not known. The President appeared worried and
                            remarked that he was at a loss to know what to tell his critics and the
                            Costa Rican courts.</p>
                        <p>Minister Echandi, after being informed of the contents of the
                            Department’s telegram, reviewed our negotiations leading up to the
                            departure of the seamen for the Canal Zone. He stressed the fact that it
                            was his understanding and the understanding of the Costa Rican
                            Government that the seamen would be permitted to leave the Canal Zone
                            under the terms set forth in the Department’s number 73, May 16, 11 a.m.
                            (see also the penultimate paragraph of my telegram No. 104 of May 17, 11
                                a.m.<note n="17" xml:id="d107fn17">Not printed.</note>) and that he
                            had so promised the German and Italian diplomatic representatives. He
                            added that he was on the verge of so informing the German Minister today
                            in reply to the protest from that diplomat (see my telegram number 128,
                            May 31, 1 p.m.) but that he is now unable to find a basis on which to
                            refute the German Minister’s allegations. (Text of the German protest
                            was transmitted to Department under cover of my despatch No. 3266, June
                            4, 1941<note n="17" xml:id="d107fn18">Not printed.</note>.)</p>
                        <p>Señor Echandi feels that in view of the fact that his promise to the Axis
                            diplomats, to the effect that the seamen would be permitted to leave the
                            Canal Zone for Japan on the first Japanese vessel, has been broken by
                            the transportation of the men from the Canal Zone on an American vessel
                            bound for the United States, apparently without waiting for the arrival
                            of a Japanese ship, his only alternative is to resign and take the blame
                            for the Costa Rican Government’s broken [promise?]. The Foreign Minister
                            seemed much perturbed by the fact that the seamen were taken from the
                            Canal Zone by the United States authorities without prior consultation
                            with or advice to the Costa Rican Government.</p>
                        <p>I feel that the resignation of Foreign Minister Echandi might have other
                            undesirable repercussions in the Costa Rican Government, and might, if
                            he decided to justify his stand in the press, cause an unfavorable
                            reaction toward the United States throughout Latin America.</p>
                        <p>This could be avoided in my opinion by a statement from the Department,
                            which I might be authorized to communicate to the Costa Rican Government
                            in writing and which it in turn might publish, to wit: (<hi
                                rend="italic">a</hi>) <pb n="94" xml:id="pg_94" facs="0102"/>that
                            the crews were transported from the Canal Zone to San Francisco because
                            the United States Government had reliable information to the effect that
                            their stay in the Zone might be indefinite due to the non availability
                            of space on Japanese ships touching the Zone; (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)
                            that these men are to remain in the United States under the surveillance
                            of the American authorities and that the Government of the United States
                            guarantees that their status while in the United States will be the same
                            as it was while they were in the Canal Zone; (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>)
                            that they will be at liberty to take any ship whatsoever, individually
                            or collectively, Japanese or otherwise, which is most desirable for
                            them, to proceed to Japan within a reasonable period, say, 60 days.</p>
                        <p>I shall see the President this evening and will be in a position to give
                            the Department his views in the matter tomorrow morning. In the meantime
                            I respectfully recommend that the Department give favorable
                            consideration to the above proposed statement and advise me by triple
                            priority telegram of its decision.</p>

                            conversation with you of June 7. The assurances given to the German and
                            Italian diplomatic representatives by the Foreign Minister (as reported
                            in your 124, May 28, 3 p.m.) have been complied with. The American
                            Government has not placed obstacles in the way of the seamen being
                            permitted to embark in the Canal Zone for Japan by the first Japanese
                            steamer calling in the Zone. However, as the American Government was
                            reliably informed that due to the non-availability of space on Japanese
                            ships calling in the Zone their stay there might be indefinitely
                            prolonged, the seamen are being transported from the Canal Zone to San
                            Francisco; while en route and in the United States, the seamen will
                            remain under the surveillance of the American authorities in the same
                            manner as when they were in the Canal Zone, and they will be given the
                            opportunity to sail from San Francisco for Japan. The German Embassy in
                            Washington has been so informed.</p>
                        <p>You are authorized to communicate the foregoing (with the exception of
                            the above reference in parentheses to your telegram) to the Costa Rican

                        <p>139. Referring to Department’s telegram No. 98, June 7, 7 p.m.,
                            immediately after my conversation with Mr. Bonsal I visited the Foreign
                            Minister and handed him the text of the Department’s statement as read
                            to me by Mr. Bonsal and confirmed in the second paragraph of the
                            telegram cited above.</p>
                        <p>Minister Echandi seemed satisfied but after discussing the matter with
                            him he did not fully express his reaction. At that time I requested
                            another interview with him today, after which I am pleased to advise the
                            Department that the Minister for Foreign Affairs expressed himself as
                            entirely satisfied and appreciative of the Department’s cooperation
                            which has removed entirely the possibility of his resignation.</p>
                        <p>He stated his intention of calling this evening on the German and Italian
                            diplomatic representatives here and informing them that the procedure
                            followed does not violate his promise to them, and that he will answer
                            the German Minister’s note of protest in a manner to terminate the
                            incident.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister also stated his intention of informing the Axis
                            diplomats that so far as Costa Rica is concerned, the Italian and German
                            Governments will have to embark the seamen from San Francisco within a
                            reasonable length of time to be determined—not yet decided but thought
                            to be about 30 days—after which Costa Rica’s responsibility in their
                            welfare will cease.</p>
                        <p>He stated that he expects the publication of the text of my note
                            containing the Department’s declaration in tomorrow’s San José
                            newspapers.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Sumner</hi>: You will recall that while I was
                            home recently, I brought to the attention of the Department orally the
                            interest which the Cuban Government, through Dr. Cortina,<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d110fn2">José Manuel Cortina, Cuban Minister of
                                State.</note> had expressed to me in establishing some closer
                            relationship with the United States in matters of defense. This took the
                            concrete form of indicating that the Cuban Government would be prepared
                            to receive a military mission from the United States composed of three
                            high-ranking officers, and the natural assumption is that one of these
                            should be from the Army, one from the Navy, and the third man one more
                            particularly interested in aviation. The other concrete idea advanced
                            was that Cuba was prepared to enter into a complete arrangement for
                            defense between the United States and Cuba which could take the form of
                            a military alliance.</p>
                        <p>So far as the military mission is concerned, you said that you felt that
                            our Government would be prepared to send such a mission whenever the
                            Cuban Government asked for it. The President,<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d110fn3">Fulgencio Batista.</note> Dr. Cortina, and I have
                            been so occupied in our conversations since my return over matters
                            connected with the financing that, I am glad to say, this question of
                            the military mission and the military alliance have not been raised. I
                            feel that the military mission and the military alliance are in some
                            respects bound up with each other, although not absolutely so. I can see
                            that we could send a military mission here at the request of the Cubans
                            without necessarily the matter of a military alliance being under
                            discussion.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, I am not sufficiently clear as to what such a mission
                            could do, or what the Cubans would expect it to do, to feel that I am
                            able to talk about the matter with that precision which I <pb n="98"
                                xml:id="pg_98" facs="0106"/>should be able to use when the Cubans
                            approach me again. I think the only attitude I can take when this comes
                            up is to say we are in principle prepared to send such a mission if the
                            Cubans desire it, but that it might be well to explore, before the
                            Cubans make a formal request, what the mission would do and what the
                            Cubans have in mind. It would be well for this purpose, too, for me to
                            know what our own Army and Navy have in mind as to what the mission
                            could do.</p>
                        <p>I am sure that what the Cuban Government had in mind in raising this
                            question of a mission was that they felt that the psychological effect
                            in Cuba would be good, and that it would be responsive to Cuban public
                            opinion, and give Cuba the feeling that she was beginning to participate
                            in defense matters—in other words I think that what they had in mind was
                            the psychological effect in Cuba and the satisfaction which would be
                            felt here over the presence of a military mission. I do not believe,
                            however, that they have thought this thing through and it might be
                            undesirable to have a mission here with all the attendant publicity
                            without it being clear that there is something for these men to do, and
                            something that they can do.</p>
                        <p>When the President or Dr. Cortina raise the matter of the mission with
                            me, I will endeavor to explore their ideas further. If in the meantime,
                            and without much delay, our own people at home could give me an idea,
                            through the Department, as to what in their opinion such a mission could
                            do. It would be very helpful to me here.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the military alliance, I find myself in a still more
                            difficult position to discuss this adequately with the President and
                            with Dr. Cortina if they raise the question again—which they have not
                            done since my return. There is no question but what the Government of
                            Cuba, from the President down, and the overwhelming majority of the
                            Cuban people, feel that their interests in the present struggle going on
                            in the world are identic with ours. It is interesting that there is such
                            general comprehension of the situation throughout the whole Island and
                            among all classes. It may safely be said that outside of the Communist
                            group, and outside of the more ignorant part of the Spanish element in
                            Cuba, there is almost complete understanding of the international
                            problem and its implications for us and Cuba. A good part of the Spanish
                            group, in spite of the sentimental attachment to Spain, realizes that a
                            German victory in Europe would be to their disadvantage—even though this
                            Hemisphere for the present were not attacked. There is a desire on the
                            part of the Cubans to do something and to feel that they are doing
                            something. The Government knows that its whole future is bound up with
                            us, and, even those in the Government who may not love us very much, are
                            for such a military alliance. In other words, the idea of a military
                            alliance with the United States is popular and there are the beginnings
                            of a popular demand here for it.</p>
                        <pb n="99" xml:id="pg_99" facs="0107"/>
                        <p>The question of a military mission, as far as I know, has only been
                            raised in this informal way by the Cuban Government with us. The
                            question of a military alliance, however, is one which is being raised
                            increasingly in the press, in patriotic organizations throughout the
                            Island and increasingly discussed by thoughtful Cubans. In the Senate
                            and in the House of Representatives there is much discussion of this and
                            a bill has been presented, or is about to be presented in the Congress,
                            authorizing the Government to enter into such a military alliance. I am
                            convinced that this initiative does not come from the Government. In
                            other words I am sure that the President and his Cabinet are not
                            stimulating or initiating in any way such legislation at this time. I do
                            not believe that they have even encouraged the discussion of a military
                            alliance in the Congress. The President and Cortina and Saladrigas<note
                                n="4" xml:id="d110fn4">Carlos Saladrigas, Cuban Prime
                                Minister.</note> and others realize that this is a matter first for
                            discussion between the two Governments.…</p>
                        <p>When I raised this question at home, you indicated to me that it would be
                            desirable for the present to try to keep this matter of a military
                            alliance in the background, and I gathered that there were reasons of
                            general policy for this. Unfortunately we were not able to discuss this
                            because of the pressures at the moment, and I was not able to learn what
                            some of these reasons of general policy might be. I have given this
                            matter very careful thought and I can appreciate, without knowing them,
                            that there may be such considerations of general policy which may make
                            undesirable our entering into a military alliance with Cuba at this
                            moment. Fortunately I have not been required to discuss this matter
                            further with the Cubans since my return, but it is a matter which is
                            bound to come up very shortly. I feel myself unable to adequately handle
                            the situation on the basis of the information I have.</p>
                        <p>The situation is that the Cuban Government is prepared to enter into a
                            far-reaching military alliance with us for an indefinite period. The
                            Cuban people undoubtedly would wholeheartedly be behind such an alliance
                            and would welcome it. Popular opinion, which may find its expression in
                            an act of the Cuban Congress shortly, is making itself felt. Under these
                            circumstances, for us to discourage the Cubans is exceedingly difficult,
                            for it may give rise to all sorts of unfortunate misunderstandings in
                            the Cuban Government and among the Cuban people. We are approaching the
                            position where something very important is being offered to us on a
                            platter and where our refusal or discouragement may be most
                            unfortunate.</p>
                        <p>I think we must keep in mind that what the Cubans seem to be prepared to
                            offer us now is something which a few months hence we may be asking for.
                            For us to be in the position of having refused now, or <pb n="100"
                                xml:id="pg_100" facs="0108"/>having shown lack of interest in, would
                            of course not be good nor helpful. As a matter of fact, while I am not
                            familiar with what we may have in mind in connection with this matter, I
                            am wondering whether we must not be prepared to go ahead in spite of
                            what these considerations may be.</p>
                        <p>What I have thought it important the Department should know, is that this
                            question of a military alliance is something in which popular opinion
                            and opinion in the Cuban Congress has gone even farther and has
                            expressed itself more concretely than has the Cuban Government in this
                            altogether informal exploratory approach it has made with us.</p>
                        <p>It is obvious that the pressure of popular opinion and the action of the
                            Congress may push the Cuban Government forward in this matter even
                            though the Government would wish to keep this in the background for the
                            present on its own initiative, or at our desire. I think I should tell
                            you that I see a position approaching very rapidly in which this matter
                            will be raised rather definitely, and if it is, I think there is only
                            one answer that we can make—and that is to go ahead with the most
                            complete military alliance.</p>
                        <p>I should add, too, that I believe that the Cuban Government has been
                            acting in complete good faith in this exploratory approach. Cortina is
                            an intelligent man who has a very thorough comprehension of what is
                            going on in the world. He has increasingly the ear and the confidence of
                            the President who places great value on his counsel. It is therefore
                            interesting that Cortina has approached this question of a military
                            alliance with the idea that it is all the more desirable that such an
                            alliance be completed between the United States and Cuba as soon as
                            possible, as it will not only consolidate a situation which must exist
                            in the interests of the two countries, but that between Cuba and the
                            United States it will be possible to make an alliance or arrangement of
                            so broad and definite a character that it will serve as a model for
                            similar arrangements which we may make with others of the American
                            Republics. In other words, he sincerely believes, in my opinion, that by
                            entering into such an alliance Cuba is not only doing the proper thing
                            so far as Cuba and the United States is concerned, but that she is
                            playing a helpful role in promoting the defense arrangements in the
                            Americas and helping us in the great task before us. I know that Cortina
                            has acquired a great deal of authority with his colleagues and his
                            views, therefore, in this particular matter carry great weight.</p>
                        <p>We have therefore a situation with respect to these matters of
                            cooperation and defense which could not be better. I think you will
                            agree that we must not cast away any opportunity now which we may be
                            seeking later, and will have made our task more difficult by the
                            discouraging attitude which we have taken. This matter is giving me a
                            good deal of preoccupation for I see the time coming when <pb n="101"
                                xml:id="pg_101" facs="0109"/>such an alliance will be of vital
                            importance to us, unless we should simply wish to occupy Cuba. You have
                            a so much broader picture than I have, and I regret that I did not have
                            an opportunity to explore this position with the Secretary and you while
                            I was home. I have written you at this length because I believe this
                            question is of primary importance in our whole inter-American problem,
                            but I feel that I am lacking in adequate information to take care of
                            this particular situation without discouraging our Cuban friends and
                            without giving rise to misapprehensions and misunderstandings. I would
                            be very happy if you could give me your thoughts on this matter in the
                            very near future. Needless to say, the question of a military mission is
                            settled as soon as we reach any decision on the question of military
                            alliance, for if a military alliance is in prospect then a mission
                            should come without delay.</p>
                        <p>With all good wishes,</p>
                        <p>Cordially and faithfully yours,</p>

                            air mail letters of May 20 and 21, 1941,<note n="7" xml:id="d113fn7"
                                >Letter of May 21 not printed.</note> wherein you comment on the
                            possibility of a military alliance between the United States and Cuba.
                            You also discuss the purpose of the proposed military and naval mission
                            to Cuba.</p>
                        <p>I understand your misgivings that any efforts made indirectly by
                            President Batista or his Government to suppress talk about an alliance
                            might be misconstrued. I am of the opinion, however, that an alliance of
                            this nature would not materially assist in advancing the defense
                            arrangements of this Hemisphere; on the contrary, in some countries such
                            a move might readily be misunderstood. I still believe, therefore, that
                            this matter should be kept in the background. In view of Dr. Saladrigas’
                            remarks, mentioned in your air mail despatch no. 2061 of May 23,<note
                                n="8" xml:id="d113fn8">Not printed.</note> and of the adjournment of
                            the Cuban Congress, this may not be as difficult as was anticipated.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the possibility of our furnishing Cuba with a military or
                            naval mission, or both, I agree with the suggestion made in your
                            despatch no. 2132 dated June 5, 1941,<note n="8" xml:id="d113fn9">Not
                                printed.</note> that for the present no action is <pb n="103"
                                xml:id="pg_103" facs="0111"/>necessary and that we should await the
                            action of the Cuban Government before doing anything further.</p>
                        <p>As to what the duties of the members of these missions would be, that
                            would seem to me to be a matter principally for determination by the
                            Cuban military and naval authorities. The assistance of our military and
                            naval attachés in Cuba in this regard might be of considerable value. In
                            several cases the War Department has sent an officer, at the request of
                            the American republic concerned, to investigate the needs of that
                            country with a view to choosing the personnel of a military or aviation
                            mission. I am told that, were Cuba to request such a preliminary survey,
                            the War Department would be prepared to send a qualified officer to Cuba
                            to carry it out.</p>

                            of the training required in Cuba in conjunction with the military
                            material to be furnished under the Lend-Lease program should have an
                            important bearing on your Attaché’s suggestions.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to bring to the attention
                            of the Department a matter which I believe is worthy of immediate and
                            serious consideration.</p>
                        <p>On June 13th during a brief conversation with President Batista in the
                            Palace, he said that he was greatly impressed by the necessities for
                            more active cooperation between Cuba and the United States in the matter
                            of the defense of the United States, of Cuba and of the American
                            Republics. He saw the war coming closer and it seemed almost inevitable
                            that the United States would take an active part in the war. In that
                            case Cuba would, because of her principles, because of her friendship
                            with the United States and because of her definite adherence to the
                            policy of inter-American defense, be in the war immediately after we
                            were. There were many things, President Batista said, which he would
                            like to do without delay in order to increase the power of Cuba to
                            cooperate in a military and naval way.</p>
                        <p>I knew what the difficulties in the way of the Cuban government were. It
                            was having serious difficulties in meeting its ordinary budgetary
                            expenditures. To endeavor to reduce these budgetary expenditures in any
                            appreciable manner would accentuate an economic situation in Cuba which
                            was already difficult and he could do nothing to interfere with economic
                            stability which was so important to insure political stability. Out of
                            its available resources and current revenues, the Cuban government was
                            not able to undertake defense measures nor to acquire defense
                            material.</p>
                        <p>In this connection the President of Cuba referred to the cooperation
                            which our government was offering under the lease-lend bill<note n="11"
                                xml:id="d115fn11">Act approved March 11, 1941; 55 Stat. 31.</note>
                            in the proposed delivery up to a certain amount of military and naval
                            equipment for the use of the Cuban Army and Navy.<note n="12"
                                xml:id="d115fn12">See <ref target="#pg_116">pp. 116</ref> ff.</note>
                            When such deliveries could be made, he said it would be possible to
                            increase the efficiency of the Cuban Army and Navy.</p>
                        <p>Completely aside from this, however, he felt there were other things
                            which Cuba should do without delay. It was not in a position to do them
                            without our active cooperation and assistance. He was hoping to take up
                            these matters with us in a broad way as soon as possible, and was
                            preparing appropriate data for our consideration. He did not wish to
                            raise at this time this general question, but he did wish to raise
                            particularly the question of the establishment of several air fields in
                            Cuba. He believed this to be a measure of immediate <pb n="105"
                                xml:id="pg_105" facs="0113"/>necessity for Cuba and for ourselves.
                            This would involve certain expenditures which the Cuban government could
                            not meet out of current revenues or available funds, and he asked me
                            whether I would take up this matter with Mr. Warren Pierson, President
                            of the Export-Import Bank, while he was in Habana in order to determine
                            whether any of the funds under the $25,000,000 credit for public works
                            and agricultural diversification projects<note n="13" xml:id="d115fn13"
                                >See <ref target="#pg_156">pp. 156</ref> ff.</note> could be used
                            for this purpose, or whether in some other way additional funds could be
                            made available by the Bank or by our government for the construction of
                            such air fields. I told President Batista I would discuss this matter
                            with Mr. Pierson.</p>
                        <p>I talked this matter over with Mr. Pierson and he agreed as to the
                            desirability of more active measures being taken by Cuba in the defense
                            problem. Mr. Pierson expressed doubt as to whether funds out of the
                            $25,000,000 credit should be used, or could be used, for this purpose.
                            He believed it would be more desirable to explore the possibility of
                            funds being made available to the Cuban government for this purpose by
                            our government in some other manner. This question arose briefly during
                            a meeting on the afternoon of June 13th between Mr. Pierson and myself
                            and the members of the Cuban Cabinet Committee considering the details
                            in connection with the $25,000,000 credit. The members of the Cabinet
                            Committee were of the opinion that it would be desirable to seek this
                            assistance from our government for the air fields outside of the
                            $25,000,000 credit.</p>
                        <p>During a long conversation with President Batista yesterday afternoon,
                            during which we discussed various matters connected with the defense
                            program as well as other subjects, he again raised in more detail and in
                            the same vein this question of the air fields. He said that if the
                            United States and Cuba got into the war there would be two major ways in
                            which Cuba would figure in the defense problem. The first and most
                            important would be in the use of Cuban soil by American troops, of Cuban
                            ports by American ships, and of Cuban air fields by American air forces;
                            the second would be by patrol of Cuban waters by American or Cuban naval
                            vessels. Of these, he considered that the immedate matter requiring
                            consideration was all possible cooperation between Cuba and the United
                            States in matters which affected aerial warfare and defense. Cuba now
                            had no planes to speak of, and the number at her disposal in the future
                            would remain limited. She was training pilots as rapidly as possible.
                            The major thing Cuba could do in this respect was to provide a base for
                            our air forces. This meant air fields which, while ostensibly built for
                            Cuba, would really be intended for our use. As it took some time to
                            build these fields, we should not wait until war was actually <pb
                                n="106" xml:id="pg_106" facs="0114"/>declared to go ahead because
                            there was no telling when they would be needed.</p>
                        <p>The President expressed the opinion that it would not be desirable to try
                            to enlarge the present air field at Camp Columbia. It was too much in
                            the city and the cost of enlarging it would be too great. To establish a
                            large air field there would be unduly exposing the city of Habana to
                            attack. The commercial air field at Rancho Boyeros was being expanded by
                            the Pan American, but it was also in many respects too close to the
                            city, although the improvements being made there by the Pan American
                            would make it useful from a military point of view. The Pan American was
                            also expanding its field at Camagüey. It was his thought that there
                            should be at least two additional fields, one between Habana and Piñar
                            del Rio and one between Santa Clara and Camagüey. In his opinion these
                            fields should be quite large and should be able to accommodate a minimum
                            of 500 planes. There should be provision for some aërodromes and repair
                            facilities at these two fields. It might be desirable also to consider
                            the establishment of an emergency landing field at some point in the
                            province of Oriente.</p>
                        <p>President Batista said that the Cuban government was prepared to go ahead
                            and expropriate the land for such fields and to construct them. He had
                            no definite idea what the cost would be, but he believed the total cost
                            might run to two or three million dollars. While the fields would
                            ostensibly be erected by the Cuban government, they would, of course, be
                            primarily intended for the use of our planes as it was quite obvious
                            that Cuba of her own, or even with our assistance, could not have the
                            planes making necessary such fields. The air fields, however, should be
                            necessary as a part of our defense scheme and as a part of the defense
                            scheme of the other American republics. They would serve not only as the
                            defense of Cuba and of the United States but as bases of operations for
                            our own air fleet and for operations further south.</p>
                        <p>The President of Cuba emphasized that the Cuban government was not so
                            much interested in the building of these air fields for any immediate
                            purposes of its own or because these air fields would be built on Cuban
                            territory and remain after the present war. The Cuban government, he
                            said, was interested because it was of the opinion we would need such
                            air bases in Cuba and it was, unfortunately, one of the few ways in
                            which Cuba could actively cooperate at this time. He again emphasized
                            what he believed to be the importance of not delaying the beginning of
                            the construction of these fields.</p>
                        <p>Naturally, I am not able to pass any judgment upon where these fields
                            should be located. I am of the opinion that the additional facilities
                            are of extreme importance. I am sure that the Cuban government <pb
                                n="107" xml:id="pg_107" facs="0115"/>would be willing to cooperate
                            with us in the most complete manner in the construction thereof. These
                            fields cannot be constructed without the financial assistance of our
                            government. The actual selection of the sites would, I believe, have to
                            be determined by our own people. The actual construction of the fields
                            from certain technical points of view would have to be directed by us.
                            There are, I believe, two immediate matters for our consideration in
                            this connection. The first is whether the appropriate funds are
                            available to our government to extend to the Cuban government the
                            financial assistance for the building of the fields; the second is the
                            determination of the sites. The question of the necessity of the fields,
                            I think, does not require consideration, as that seems to be clearly
                            established if one views the situation realistically.</p>
                        <p>It may be possible that funds for this purpose can be made available
                            through the Export-Import Bank; it may be possible to do so under the
                            Lease-Lend bill; it may be possible to do so through other funds at the
                            disposal of the President. In view of the financial situation of the
                            Cuban government, the nature of the projects and the fact that they are
                            purely of defense nature, this would, I believe, influence our
                            government in determining whether this obligation by the Cuban
                            government is a reimbursable one. I believe under no circumstances
                            should interest be received for any funds which may be advanced to the
                            Cuban government for this purpose.</p>
                        <p>The first step after appropriate decisions of a major character have been
                            taken would be for competent officials of our government to proceed to
                            Habana for the purpose of determining where the fields should be built
                            and what sum may be necessary for this purpose.</p>
                        <p>In view of the fact that this matter was discussed with Mr. Warren

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of the Department’s strictly confidential instruction no. 736,
                            of June 21, 1941,<note n="14" xml:id="d116fn14">Not printed.</note> with
                            regard to the secret contract between the War Department and Pan
                            American <pb n="108" xml:id="pg_108" facs="0116"/>Airways for the
                            improvement of airport and seaplane base facilities in the various
                            countries of the Western Hemisphere.</p>
                        <p>I have had some knowledge of the nature of these arrangements and I have
                            collaborated with the Pan American Airways in such ways as may have been
                            possible and proper in the work which they are carrying through in Cuba
                            under this arrangement.</p>
                        <p>The Camagüey Field is the only one in Cuba which is affected by the
                            arrangements between the Pan American Airways and the War Department.
                            The Pan American Airways will also improve their field at Rancho
                            Boyeros, near Habana, but it is my understanding that the work which the
                            Pan American Airways is doing at Rancho Boyeros does not fall within the
                            scope of the agreement under reference.</p>
                        <p>When the Pan American Airways first started the development of its field
                            at Camagüey under this arrangement with the War Department, the attorney
                            in Cuba for Pan American Airways, Dr. Mario Lazo, got in touch with me.
                            Since that time this Embassy has collaborated with Dr. Lazo in every
                            possible and proper way in facilitating the arrangements for the
                            development of the Camagüey Field. I have discussed the matter in
                            confidence with the President of Cuba, the Minister of State and the
                            Minister of Defense on several occasions, and so far as I am aware, the
                            Pan American Airways and the attorney here, Dr. Lazo, have been more
                            than satisfied with the cooperation which they have received from the
                            Cuban government.</p>
                        <p>I doubt, therefore, whether the Department’s instruction no. 736, under
                            reference, has any application so far as the Pan American Airways having
                            encountered difficulties in negotiations with the government of Cuba in
                            this matter. I shall continue to give to the Pan American Airways such
                            collaboration in this matter as it may be feasible and proper to
                            give.</p>

                            reply to mine of June 20th<note n="15" xml:id="d117fn15">Neither

                            with respect to the desires expressed by President Batista for the
                            building of several airfields in Cuba. I appreciate very much the
                            attention <pb n="109" xml:id="pg_109" facs="0117"/>which you have given
                            this matter and note you will be discussing it with General
                                Marshall<note n="16" xml:id="d117fn16">Gen. George C. Marshall,
                                Chief of Staff.</note> and Admiral Stark.<note n="17"

                                Operations.</note></p>
                        <p>The more I ponder over this matter of the airfields, the more I am
                            impressed with the necessity of our doing something about it without
                            delay. I think the Cuban Government will not be able to make any
                            financial contribution, as the financial situation in the Government is
                            so difficult that I do not see how they can make any worthwhile
                            contribution. My own feeling is that if we have to bear the whole cost
                            ourselves and even though the fields remain the property of the Cuban
                            Government, we should go ahead with the matter without delay. The Cuban
                            Government will, I am sure, be able to expropriate the land at
                            reasonable cost so that the actual acquisition of the land by the Cuban
                            Government should represent no considerable amount. The places at which
                            the fields should be constructed and the technical details are matters
                            on which I can offer no comment as I do not have adequate competence. I
                            do believe that the erection of the fields without delay is
                            necessary—and this aside from what we are doing to help the Pan American
                            with a field at Camagüey.</p>
                        <p>With all good wishes,</p>

                                xml:id="d119fn20">Division of the American Republics.</note> on July
                            7 and 10. He discussed a draft agreement between Cuba and the United
                            States for the extension of the area around the Guantánamo Naval Station
                            concession desired by the Navy Department for defense purposes. Mr.
                            Bonsal took some pains to explain to Captain Schuirmann the principles,
                            to which the Department attaches great importance, which we wished to
                            proceed upon in drafting the Guantánamo extension agreement. The
                            cooperative spirit of the Cubans might make it easier for us to obtain
                            the type of agreement from Cuba in which the Navy is granted a great
                            many powers, but such an agreement might well arouse suspicions, doubts
                            and misgivings in other countries, such as Mexico, where we are anxious
                            to have defense facilities established for Hemisphere defense on a joint
                            basis. The principle of leased areas over which the United States forces
                            exercise unquestioned jurisdiction could not be applied to other
                            countries of the Hemisphere and, in fact, in Cuba, while in practice we
                            might obtain greater jurisdictional powers than elsewhere, the
                            constitution itself prohibits further alienation of jurisdiction over
                            Cuban territory. For these reasons, the Department felt that the Navy
                            Department’s draft agreement, contained in Acting Secretary Forrestal’s
                            letter of June 17,<note n="21" xml:id="d119fn21">Not printed.</note>
                            would not be satisfactory, especially in the light of the program for
                            other countries.</p>
                        <p>Captain Schuirmann, who appeared to understand the Department’s viewpoint
                            perfectly, nevertheless let it be understood that there are others in
                            the Navy Department who, if they are unable to obtain jurisdiction over
                            defense facilities abroad on an exclusive basis, are ready to abandon
                            the Guantánamo extension project in favor of Jamaica. Captain Schuirmann
                            added that some elements of the Navy Department felt that the conditions
                            under which we are establishing bases in British territories where we do
                            not question British sovereignty are a strong argument in favor of
                            similar arrangements in the American republics, including Cuba. Mr.
                            Bonsal questioned the parallelism between the bases in British
                            territories and those in the American republics. In concluding the July
                            7 meeting, Captain Schuirmann referred to Navy’s legal handicap in
                            spending money on land which is not under its jurisdiction.</p>
                        <pb n="111" xml:id="pg_111" facs="0119"/>
                        <p>It was agreed at the July 7 meeting that Mr. Walmsley would prepare a
                            draft incorporating the Department’s views for discussion on July
                            10.</p>
                        <p>Rough copies of the Department’s proposed agreement were distributed on
                            July 10 to those present and to LE.<note n="22" xml:id="d119fn22">Office
                                of the Legal Adviser.</note> The question of the Navy’s legal
                            handicap in spending money on defense installations on land not under
                            its jurisdiction was brought up. The question was that as the
                            installations in the extended Guantánamo area would be made under
                            specific appropriations, a suitable provision could be included in the
                            appropriation bill to take care of the legal handicap.</p>
                        <p>Captain Schuirmann, with regard to the matter of jurisdiction, emphasized
                            that it was essential that United States forces be permitted to guard
                            and patrol the installations it builds or establishes. It was suggested
                            that this could be taken care of without raising the question of
                            jurisdiction by assigning specific functions to the United States and
                            Cuban forces in the area under a joint board which is provided for in
                            the Department’s draft agreement. Captain Schuirmann agreed to pass
                            copies of the draft around the Navy Department but threw out the hint
                            again that it might be difficult to convince the Navy Department that
                            the cooperative principle was workable or desirable and that the
                            possibility of abandoning the Guantánamo extension in favor of Jamaica
                            had by no means been dissipated. In this connection the Department’s
                            view was made clear that even though the Navy Department might never
                            decide to carry through the Guantánamo extension project, a cooperative
                            defense agreement with the Cubans is nevertheless essential for its
                            effect on United States relations with Cuba and the other American
                            republics. Such an agreement, even though no action were taken under it,
                            would give the Cubans a sense of participation in Hemisphere
                            defense.</p>

                            to avoid such undesirable features as lease provisions, sole United
                            States jurisdiction, alienation of foreign territorial sovereignty, and
                            the like. It is hoped that this type of agreement may serve as a model
                            for any similar agreements with any other American republics which the
                            requirements of continental defense may necessitate.</p>

                            appended despatch,<note n="24" xml:id="d121fn24">No. 3136, December 17,

                            gist of it without delay. To this end, I am sending a copy to Orme
                            Wilson and to Walmsley.</p>
                        <p>The Cubans declared war on Japan, Germany and Italy without fear and
                            without reserves, but naturally they realize they have opened themselves
                            to attack more than if they had remained quiescent or had merely broken
                            relations. There is, of course, the possibility of attack. The
                            Government realizes the need of some action. I have explained their
                            attitude, which is very good, in the appended despatch. The best way of
                            meeting the situation will be by sending a mission here composed of an
                            Army, Navy, and Marine Corps officer. For many reasons, this should be
                            done without delay. I am sure our people in the Army, <pb n="113"
                                xml:id="pg_113" facs="0121"/>Navy and Marine Corps will be prepared
                            to do this. Whether the Cubans will ask us to do it through Concheso, or
                            through me, we will know in a day or two. I suggested to Cortina that in
                            some ways it would be better for them to ask Concheso to take it up with
                            us at home. The purpose of the appended despatch is to give the adequate
                            background and my own suggestions and observations for such help as they
                            may be. My own hope is that the mission will be on its way within ten
                            days and the sooner the better, I believe.</p>
                        <p>With all good wishes,</p>

                            instruction No. 793 of July 25, 1941 forwarding a draft agreement for
                            the proposed Guantánamo extension and to your despatch no. 2919 of
                            November 12<note n="25" xml:id="d122fn25">Despatch not printed.</note>
                            returning Draft F consisting of the Cuban counter-proposal which would
                            establish “A Cuban military zone for joint defense” adjacent to the
                            present United States Naval Station at Guantánamo.</p>
                        <p>There is now enclosed what may be designated as Draft H.<note n="26"
                                xml:id="d122fn26">Not printed.</note> This draft has been developed
                            from the Cuban draft by a representative of the Navy Department and
                            officers of the several Divisions of the Department concerned, including
                            the Legal Adviser, the Liaison Officer, the Division of the American
                            Republics and the Treaty Division. The translation from the Spanish of
                            Draft F apparently resulted in inconsistencies in the English versions
                            of Drafts D and F. These have been corrected and the phraseology usual
                            in such agreements has been formalized.</p>
                        <p>You may find the accompanying memorandum of December 19 from the Treaty

                                files.</note> of some use in understanding the reasons for
                            formalizing and increasing the precision of the English draft. The

                                <item>It appears to the Department that the fact of mentioning in
                                    the first paragraph of Article I of the Cuban Draft G that the
                                    zone will be “commanded, occupied and administered by the armed
                                    forces of the Republic of Cuba” et cetera, creates a doubt as to
                                    sovereignty. It should be taken for granted that the zone is
                                    Cuban, as clearly indicated by the title and that it will be so
                                    commanded, et cetera, by Cuban forces.</item>

                                <item>The more general language of Article II of Draft H as to the
                                    powers of the Joint Commission, as compared with the text in
                                    Draft F appears to both the Navy Department and this Department
                                    to be far preferable. The English translation of this portion of
                                    Draft F has been thoroughly overhauled for clarity without, in

                                <item>With regard to the insertion in Article VII of the clause “who
                                    may be hired locally”, the Navy Department points out that the
                                    engagement of certain skilled workmen and foremen in the United
                                    States for temporary employment in connection, for example, with
                                    installations of delicate apparatus, should be retained within
                                    the Navy’s jurisdiction. The Department sees no reason for
                                    objection to this clause.</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>The Navy Department in connection with the second sentence of
                                    Article VIII of Draft F feels that for it to obligate itself to
                                    install “the instrumentalities which may be indispensable” is an
                                    invitation to misunderstanding or misinterpretation. The
                                    reservation of the right to make such installations as now
                                    provided in the second sentence appears to obviate this danger.
                                    In the next paragraph the Navy Department has considered it
                                    advisable to insert the word “remaining”, which would permit the
                                    replacement of equipment during the life of the agreement, the
                                    removal of equipment to other zones of action as military
                                    necessities may dictate, and would yet assure that property of
                                    the United States Government in the zone upon termination of the
                                    agreement would become Cuban property as desired by the Cuban
                                    Government.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>You are authorized to sign the agreement on the basis of the attached
                            draft if it meets with the approval of the Cuban Government. The Navy
                            Department concurs.</p>
                        <p>While there is no need for you to submit to the Department for final
                            approval the Spanish version of this agreement, you are requested to
                            satisfy yourself of the accuracy of the Spanish text. Any minor

                        <p>The American Ambassador to Cuba telephoned the other day to state that
                            the Cuban Government had informed him that it agreed in principle <pb

                            Ambassador Messersmith has stated that your Department could proceed
                            with the necessary plans, and he requested that the Embassy be advised
                            in advance of the dispatch of any of the service units.<note n="28"

                        <p>192. The Department on July 17 handed to the Cuban Ambassador a
                                draft<note n="34" xml:id="d126fn34">Not found in Department
                                files.</note> of basic agreement for the lend-lease program of
                            transferring military matériel to Cuba. The principal financial
                            provisions are as follows: Cuba is to receive a total of $3,700,000 of
                            war and navy matériel of which it is expected $1,000,000 of army
                            matériel and $100,000 of navy matériel will be transferred during the
                            fiscal year ending June 30, 1942. This delivery date is subject to
                            change if broad defense considerations so require.</p>
                        <p>With respect to repayment, Cuba is expected to pay $400,000 in each
                            fiscal year until 1947, making a total of $2,400,000 to be repaid prior
                            to June 30, 1947. In consideration of the broad objectives of the
                            program and of certain very general economic concepts, the entire
                            obligation of Cuba to the United States would be considered discharged
                            by such payments.</p>

                        <p>The Ambassador<note n="35" xml:id="d127fn35">Aurelio F. Concheso, the
                                Cuban Ambassador.</note> told me with some agitation that the
                            previous evening a special messenger had arrived from Cuba with an
                            instruction from the President. The President and his cabinet were very
                            disturbed not only by the total quantity of military and naval matériel
                            allocated to Cuba under the Lend Lease program but also by the amounts
                            to be delivered during the first year. These figures are $1,000,000 for
                            military equipment and $100,000 for naval matériel. The Ambassador was
                            instructed to take up immediately with this Government the possibility
                            of augmenting both the total figures and the amounts to be furnished in
                            the first year.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador stated that the President and his cabinet were profoundly
                            disturbed by the allocations for Cuba since the amounts for Cuba were
                            only a fraction of the requests submitted. The President could only
                            suppose that the thought of our military and naval officials was that
                            the United States would take care of the defense of Cuba. The President
                            thought that this was not only not in keeping with the dignity of Cuba
                            but that it would certainly prove much more <pb n="118" xml:id="pg_118"
                                facs="0126"/>expensive for the United States to assume the total
                            burden for the defense of Cuba than were Cuba to do so itself.</p>
                        <p>I informed the Ambassador that the request of the President for a
                            reconsideration of the allocation for Cuba would, of course, immediately
                            be studied and given the most sympathetic consideration. I said that the
                            allocations for Cuba and for all other countries had been made by the
                            Army and Navy so that it would be necessary to take the subject up with
                            them. I said that there were certain difficulties in view of the
                            limitation on the total amount available for the other American
                            Republics. I hoped, however, that some readjustments might be made.</p>
                        <p>On August 12 the Ambassador returned to leave with me the memorandum
                            which is attached.<note n="37" xml:id="d127fn37"><hi rend="italic"
                                    >Infra</hi>.</note> I thanked him for the memorandum stating
                            that it would be useful in the discussions with the appropriate officers
                            in the War and Navy Departments. I told the Ambassador that, upon the
                            return of Mr. Welles,<note n="38" xml:id="d127fn38">Sumner Welles, Under
                                Secretary of State.</note> I was going to recommend to him that he
                            personally take up the question with the Chief of Staff and the Chief of
                            Naval Operations.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador expressed appreciation for the sympathetic reception that
                            had been accorded to him and said that he would like to be advised
                            promptly upon the outcome of the reconsideration of the figures by the
                            War and Navy Departments.</p>

                            Liaison Officer Memorandum U–L 810.20 Defense/1267 of August 23,
                                1941,<note n="40" xml:id="d129fn40">Not printed.</note> furnishing
                            information regarding the dissatisfaction on the part of Cuba with the
                            offer made by the United States of Military and Naval material under the
                            Lend-Lease Program.</p>
                        <p>Upon a recommendation of the Joint Army-Navy Advisory Board on American
                            Republics, a total allocation of credit for Cuban Naval material was
                            tentatively set at $700,000. It was further indicated, as the opinion of
                            the Board, that material not to exceed in value $100,000 could probably
                            be delivered during the present fiscal year.</p>
                        <p>Although the Navy Department has not been informed of the details of the
                            basic agreement negotiated by the State Department with the Government
                            of Cuba, or with the Government of any other American Republic, from the
                            tenure of the despatches enclosed in Department of State Liaison Officer
                            Memorandum, it would appear that the Cuban Government has been informed
                            that the extent of their credit during the present fiscal year is
                            limited to $100,000.</p>
                        <p>It is thought that the dissatisfaction expressed by the Cuban Government
                            is partly due to the failure to distinguish between the value of
                            material which could be delivered during this fiscal year, and the
                            necessary credit required to make contracts and place on order material
                            which will require twelve months or more to manufacture.</p>
                        <p>The amount of the Naval allocation of credit was based on recommendations
                            of the staff conversations which took place between representatives of
                            the United States Navy and the Cuban Navy. Since these conversations
                            were held, there has been a change in the administrative head of the
                            Cuban Navy. The new regime has greatly increased the amount of material
                            requested.</p>
                        <p>There is no objection on the part of the Navy Department to an increase
                            in the allocation of credit to purchase all of the Naval material
                            requested by the Cuban Government as being urgent in character for
                            National Defense. It is estimated that this will require a total sum of
                            $3,700,000 for Naval credit alone, or an increase of $3,000,000 over the
                            present allocation. This amount can be taken from the unallocated
                            reserve.</p>
                        <p>It is desired to point out that in case the basic agreements made with
                            other American Republics have also confused the value of material that
                                <pb n="121" xml:id="pg_121" facs="0129"/>could probably be delivered
                            during this fiscal year with the amount of credits desired to make
                            contracts for future delivery, there will be other cases of
                            dissatisfaction.</p>
                        <p>It is the understanding of the Navy Department that, except for a very
                            small sum to procure articles already manufactured, there is no money
                            available under the Lend-Lease appropriation for the procurement of any
                            of the material requested by Latin American Governments. Furthermore, no
                            funds can be made available for this purpose until a new Lend-Lease
                            appropriation has been approved by Congress.<note n="41"
                                xml:id="d129fn41">For the provision of additional funds, see the Act
                                of October 28, 1941, 55 Stat. 745.</note> It would, therefore,
                            appear to be impracticable to inform the other American Republics what
                            credit they should expect during this fiscal year, until Congress has
                            appropriated the necessary funds.</p>
                        <p>Representatives of the Navy Department have appeared before the Bureau of
                            the Budget during the consideration of the projects which Congress will
                            be requested to appropriate for a new Lend-Lease appropriation. In
                            discussing the funds required, it was particularly requested that the
                            total allocation of credits allowed to the American Republics should be
                            made available during this fiscal year, in order that contracts could be
                            negotiated for the future delivery of material as well as the delivery
                            of any material that could be made available during this fiscal year. It
                            was stated that, out of the total of $100,000,000 requested for Naval
                            material, it was not considered possible to deliver more than
                            approximately $12,000,000 in value during the present fiscal year.</p>
                        <p>It is suggested that the dissatisfaction of the Cuban Government can be
                            dissipated by simply explaining that their total allocation of credit to
                            procure Naval material will be increased to a total of $3,700,000, and
                            the credit for this fiscal year will be whatever part of this amount
                            that is allowed by Congress.</p>

                        <p>The Ambassador stated that a law had just been enacted in Cuba providing
                            for immediate expansion of the army and navy. Under this law about
                            80,000 men could be inducted into the army and navy. However, the Cuban
                            Government at this time wishes to increase its military and naval
                            establishment by about 25,000. This expansion would require the
                            acquisition by the navy of light cruisers, fast torpedo launches, and a
                            number of airplanes to a total value of over $20,000,000, as well as
                            arms and equipment for the contemplated increase in the land forces
                            costing an amount of over $5,000,000. All of the above expenses would be
                            in excess of the credit of $7,200,000 allocated to Cuba under the
                            provisions of the Lend-Lease Act.</p>
                        <p>Neither Major Munilla nor Commander Peláez was able to give me more than
                            tentative information concerning this matériel, so I requested them to
                            furnish me as soon as possible with written lists, and assured them that
                            they would receive suitable consideration. The Ambassador stated that
                            although the lists already submitted had absorbed the allotted
                            $7,200,000, it might be necessary to replace some of the material on
                            those lists by equipment more urgently needed under the new law for the
                            expansion of the army and navy, particularly airplanes.</p>
                        <p>Commander Peláez referred to the urgent need for the fast patrol boats as
                            those now owned by the Cuban Navy are not only old but antiquated in
                            equipment. He added that it would be necessary if these boats were
                            acquired to establish facilities for these vessels at various points
                            along the coast of Cuba, the only places where such ships can be
                            serviced at present being Habana and Cienfuegos. He expressed the
                            opinion that these fast vessels would be of use in convoying sugar-laden
                            ships from Cuba to the United States.</p>
                        <p>Colonel Barber explained at some length the critical situation that has
                            arisen during the last week. The United States, he said, instead of
                            merely furnishing arms and munitions to other countries resisting
                            aggression, is now obliged to fight on two fronts and to arm itself in
                            addition to sending large quantities of material to Great Britain,
                            Russia, etc. Consequently, he could not give any assurances to the
                            Cubans that they would obtain this greatly expanded quantity of material
                            at short notice. The Ambassador and the two Attachés expressed interest
                            in his explanation, the Ambassador intimating that he would inform the
                            President.</p>
                        <p>They promised to send me the additional lists as soon as possible.
                            Commander Peláez, however, said that as far as the Navy is concerned,
                            this might not be done until after his return from Habana where he is
                            going to spend the Christmas holidays.</p>

                            Department’s consideration:</p>
                        <p>The prolonged conversations which the Cuban Delegation had in Washington
                            with respect to the loan for $50,000,000 requested by the Cuban
                            Government and the failure to arrive at any definite conclusions before
                            the return of the Delegation to Habana have had an undoubted effect in
                            decreasing the prestige and authority of the present Cuban Government.
                            It will be recalled that the Cuban Government passed the authorizing act
                            for a $50,000,000 loan without previous consultation with our Government
                            and that there had been no preliminary preparation between the two
                            Governments for the negotiation of a loan. I have every reason to
                            believe that the Cuban Government caused this authorizing act to be
                            passed on the basis of misapprehensions which it had concerning the form
                            and the conditions under which a loan could be secured from our
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>The counterproposals made by the Minister of State, Dr. Cortina, now
                            before the Department for its consideration, have been made, I believe,
                            in good faith and with the desire to present a basis for economic and
                            financial cooperation and assistance acceptable to our Government. The
                            situation in Cuba is such, and our interest in the Cuban situation for
                            economic and defense reasons is such, that I believe the
                            counterproposals should be given as prompt consideration as possible and
                            considered in the light of all the factors involved in our relationships
                            with Cuba.</p>
                        <p>The situation with which Cuba is faced through the loss of her European
                            markets for sugar and tobacco is a serious one and one which we cannot
                            ignore and must take into account in all consideration which we give to
                            the political and defense factors involved in our relationships. There
                            is not only the loss to the Cuban economy involved in the practical
                            disappearance of these exports to Europe, but also the loss of revenue
                            to the Cuban Government through import duties on goods which formerly
                            were imported from Europe and which now come from the United States,
                            paying under our reciprocal trade treaty lower rates than if they came
                            from Europe. There is, therefore, a <pb n="128" xml:id="pg_128"
                                facs="0136"/>definite loss to the Cuban economy through the dropping
                            off of exports and loss in revenue to the Cuban Treasury through lower
                            customs revenue on imports.</p>
                        <p>Any consideration of the economic situation in Cuba emphasizes the
                            importance of aid first on sugar. The closing of the European market
                            will make it necessary for the Cuban Government to fix the grinding
                            quota for this year at 2,000,000 tons, as this is all that the American
                            and Cuban markets will absorb under present quotas and conditions. If
                            this action has to be taken by the Cuban Government, there will be,
                            within three or four months at the latest, economic distress of a
                            character which will with almost definite certainty bring about social
                            and political unrest of a serious character. A considerable part of the
                            Cuban population earns during the cutting and grinding season the actual
                            money on which they have to exist during the whole of the year. If this
                            grinding season is materially reduced, there will be economic distress
                            which will assume serious proportions first in the rural districts and
                            then in the cities. The Communist elements in Cuba are already
                            exploiting the rural laborers and the poorer people in the cities, and
                            would be the active factor to bring about social and political
                            disorders.</p>
                        <p>It is my considered opinion that the most effective step we can take to
                            maintain the Cuban economic situation is to make it possible for the
                            grinding quota to be fixed for this year at 2,500,000 tons instead of
                            2,000,000 tons. This is the Department’s attitude and appropriate
                            measures are now in progress to secure the cooperation of the
                            Export-Import Bank in the financing of these 500,000 tons. I will not
                            discuss here the details of this measure, nor its effects, because these
                            are so well known in the Department, but it is sufficient to say here
                            that the money loaned by the Export-Import Bank on this sugar would go
                            almost entirely into the payment of wages. It is the one step which we
                            can take immediately which is certain to avoid economic disaster in Cuba
                            and its inevitable consequences, which we wish to avoid.</p>
                        <p>This aid on sugar, therefore, is as imperative as it is desirable and I
                            have the conviction that it will prove to have been a desirable
                            transaction for our Government not only from the point of view of
                            maintaining stability in Cuba, but also that the sugars involved can in
                            various ways be disposed of, so that there will be no loss, or at the
                            most no appreciable loss, to our Government through the transaction.</p>
                        <p>The effect of the sugar transaction will be to strengthen the position of
                            the Cuban Government by increasing its prestige and authority and laying
                            the first basis for measures which it is indispensable that the Cuban
                            Government take. There are, however, in my opinion further measures
                            which must be taken by our Government on the basis of the proposals made
                            by the Minister of State, Dr. Cortina.</p>
                        <pb n="129" xml:id="pg_129" facs="0137"/>
                        <p>In the counterproposals submitted by the Cuban Government, there is a
                            request for the immediate consideration by our Government of the
                            agreement in principle on a credit to the Cuban Government of
                            $10,000,000 for agricultural diversification projects and a credit for
                            public works in an amount not fixed and left to the determination of our
                            Government. The memorandum of the Minister of State points out that no
                            money would actually pass into the hands of the Cuban Government on the
                            basis of this agreement in principle. He has indicated that the
                            individual projects under the agricultural program and the public works
                            program would be agreed upon between the Cuban Government and the
                            representative or representatives of the Export-Import Bank. No money
                            would be paid out on the basis of any approved project for which an
                            allocation had been made under the credit by agreement, except on the
                            basis of vouchers approved by the representative of the Export-Import
                            Bank. I believe that such an arrangement would offer ample safeguards to
                            both Governments to prevent the passing of money into the hands of
                            improper persons and that the control which would be exercised over the
                            expenditure of funds which we might loan to Cuba would be greater than
                            that envisaged in any proposals which we have made to the Cuban
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>I believe that it is desirable that we should proceed immediately with
                            the appropriate consultation with the Export-Import Bank and other
                            agencies of our Government to secure agreement by our Government on the
                            opening of a credit to Cuba under the above conditions for $10,000,000
                            for agricultural projects and $20,000,000 for public works projects. As
                            legislation by the Cuban Government will be necessary for the funding
                            and repayment of the debt, et cetera, it will be necessary to fix a
                            maximum amount which we are prepared to give for agricultural
                            diversification and public works projects, and such an amount would have
                            to be included in the Cuban law.</p>
                        <p>On the basis of the assumption that we will make a loan on 500,000 tons
                            of sugar within a very short period, I believe that this further action
                            of announcing agreement in principle between the American and Cuban
                            Governments for a credit of $10,000,000 for agricultural diversification
                            projects and $20,000,000 for public works projects is essential and
                            desirable. The loan on sugar will meet the immediate situation in
                            avoiding economic distress and consequent social and political
                            disorders. The effect of the action on sugar will be immediate and
                            widespread throughout the island. If we agree in principle with the
                            Cuban Government for the agricultural credit and public works credit,
                            there will be a period of six to eight months before the effects will be
                            felt in the Cuban economy through actual work on projects because of the
                            surveys which will have to be made, the decisions which will have to be
                            reached and the actual work on the projects.</p>
                        <pb n="130" xml:id="pg_130" facs="0138"/>
                        <p>The Minister of State has emphasized the importance of the announcement
                            of agreement in principle on agricultural and public works credits. The
                            successful conclusion of action on sugar will give the Government the
                            prestige which it sadly needs, he says. This further action on
                            agricultural and public works credits, he says, is necessary to meet the
                            economic problem of Cuba, et cetera, and also as a further measure to
                            give the Cuban Government the prestige which is necessary among the mass
                            of the people in order to enable it to proceed with the reforms in the
                            Treasury, in the Customs, in the Army, and in the Budget, which the
                            Cuban Government is in agreement are essential and in which our
                            Government is also interested so definitely. He says that, without this
                            prestige which such action by our Government will give, it is quite
                            impossible for the Cuban Government to proceed with a program of reforms
                            in the Treasury, in the Customs, in the Army and in certain other
                            administrative organisms and practices.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister has stated that these reforms will have to be made
                            by the Cuban Government itself rather than through joint committees of
                            Cuban and American officials. Any action through joint committees, he
                            states, would simply undermine the already too-small prestige of the
                            Cuban Government. This would not exclude, however, the collaboration of
                            experts of our Government, who would be welcomed by the Cuban Government
                            and who could lend their effective assistance as definitely in this way
                            as if they were actually on a joint committee. The procedure would avoid
                            further lowering of the prestige of the Cuban Government.</p>
                        <p>The Minister of State has indicated that he realizes our interest in
                            certain administrative reforms and procedures. These, he says, the Cuban
                            Government is prepared to carry through. Under present circumstances,
                            they could not carry through such reforms, as the Government is without
                            the necessary prestige. With the action on sugar contemplated and with
                            agreement in principle announced between the two Governments on
                            agricultural and public works credits, the Government would have the
                            necessary prestige among the masses to proceed with the necessary
                            reforms and changes. He emphasized that reforms would have to be made in
                            the Army at the same time that they are made in the civil
                            administration, and it is quite obvious that, if the Government takes
                            these steps without the necessary prestige which comes from the
                            assurance of these agreements and the support of our Government, the
                            Government would be destroying itself.</p>
                        <p>I am on the whole in agreement with this attitude of the Minister and I
                            believe that we cannot expect performance under any circumstances unless
                            we give the Cuban Government the prestige which it so sadly needs.
                            Unless we take the appropriate steps we will be faced eventually by
                            economic and social disorders, with political consequences. <pb n="131"
                                xml:id="pg_131" facs="0139"/>These would not lead necessarily, and
                            in my opinion would not lead, to a better government to replace the
                            present one, unless we intervened either indirectly or directly in the
                            establishment of the new Government. Such intervention, even indirect, I
                            believe we wish to avoid.</p>
                        <p>The proposals of the Foreign Minister, I believe, present a sound basis
                            of approach to the problem and for the purpose the only feasible one. We
                            are interested in the maintenance of economic, social and political
                            stability in Cuba not only for economic reasons, but now for compelling
                            political and strategic reasons. This is the first constitutional
                            Government which Cuba has had for seven years and we would, I believe,
                            be placing ourselves in an impossible position if we do not give the
                            present Government the support which it needs.</p>
                        <p>I believe we must bear in mind certain factors which bear on our attitude
                            during the last year. Cuba bought approximately $80,000,000 worth of
                            American merchandise, for which we were paid without any assistance on
                            exchange or loans. She has continued to meet the interest on her public
                            debt promptly. She has made the last payment under the Chadbourne Plan.
                            She has in no way interfered, through export or import restrictions, on
                            American goods, et cetera. She has paid promptly and in dollars her
                            current obligations without any assistance on exchange or without loans.
                            The Cuban Congress has approved the funding of the last part of the
                            public works obligations as a measure of reestablishment of credit. Our
                            Government made no promises of aid and, in all my conversations, I
                            refrained from any such promises. I indicated, as I had authorization to
                            do, that we considered the passing of the public works bill<note n="47"
                                xml:id="d134fn47">See <ref target="frus1940v05#pg_743"><hi

                            necessary action to reestablish Cuban credit. The Cuban Government
                            undoubtedly, however, had in mind our program of financial and economic
                            cooperation with the other American republics and was influenced in its
                            action on the public works bill by obvious considerations of future
                            assistance from us.</p>
                        <p>There is the further consideration that Cuba has shown the most definite
                            attitude of complete cooperation so far in matters of Cuban, American,
                            and inter-American defense. Probably no other American republic has
                            taken so completely cooperative an attitude as Cuba in matters of
                            defense. So far this cooperation has not been a matter of <hi
                                rend="italic">quid pro quo</hi> and the President and Foreign
                            Minister have repeatedly assured that it will not be made a question of
                                <hi rend="italic">quid pro quo</hi>. It is obvious, however, that
                            for political and strategic reasons this complete cooperation in defense
                            with Cuba is in many respects more important to us than that with any of
                            the American republics.</p>
                        <p>On our side, so far as Cuba is concerned, we have done nothing in the way
                            of assisting her in recent years beyond the maintenance of a quota for
                            sugar and in this we cannot claim too great virtue. It was on our <pb
                                n="132" xml:id="pg_132" facs="0140"/>initiative and as a measure of
                            cooperation with us in times of stress that Cuba raised her sugar
                            production to high levels. Since then we have been consistently reducing
                            our takings of Cuban sugar and, while we have given the advice that Cuba
                            should resort to greater agricultural diversification in order to meet
                            our own problem of increasing domestic sugar production, we have done
                            nothing of a definite character in the way of financial assistance, or
                            real cooperation on an effective scale in aiding diversification.</p>
                        <p>There appears to be, therefore, on the whole a fair balance on the side
                            of Cuba and if we wish to maintain the very considerable market we have
                            for American goods, to maintain economic, social and political stability
                            and to keep the way open for the most complete cooperation in defense,
                            there are certain measures which we shall in all prudence have to
                            take.</p>

                        <p>The Cuban Government on its side, on the agreement on the sugar aid and
                            the announcement of the credits above mentioned would begin a program of
                            administrative reforms in the Treasury, in the Customs and other
                            organisms of the Government. These reforms would involve the dismissal
                            of individuals who have been guilty of improper practices or have
                            sponsored them. It would include the study and progressive carrying
                            through of the administrative reforms and practices. The appropriate
                            action on the reduction in the budget would be carried through and
                            approved by the Congress.</p>
                        <p>The Minister of State has pointed out that his counterproposals call for
                            a program of mutual fulfilment. He has emphasized that under the
                            proposals no money comes into the hands of the Cuban Government so that
                            our Government is in a position at any time through the Export-Import
                            Bank to stop the approval of projects or the payment of vouchers under
                            projects approved. In case the Cuban Government does not immediately and
                            progressively take action along the lines on which it has indicated its
                            willingness to proceed, we can stop any further action on approval of
                            projects or payments on projects. The Minister states that no Cuban
                            Government could afford not to proceed with such a program of fulfilment
                            on its part as such failure would <pb n="133" xml:id="pg_133"
                                facs="0141"/>destroy the Government itself. If it became known, as
                            it inevitably would, that it had been through failure of the Cuban
                            Government to meet its responsibilities and promises that productive and
                            constructive work in Cuba fostered by our Government was not being
                            carried forward, the Cuban Government could not withstand such a
                            situation and would therefore be forced to follow a policy of
                            fulfilment.</p>
                        <p>The Cuban Government has expressed its willingness to begin immediately
                            negotiations for a new treaty of navigation and residence on broad lines
                            and also desires to proceed with a revision of the trade agreement or
                            the negotiation of a supplementary trade agreement. It is prepared to
                            begin these negotiations at once and in my opinion immediate steps
                            should be taken on both sides toward the opening of such
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>I realize that, on the basis of past performance in certain aspects of
                            Cuban-American relationships, we cannot place too much dependence on
                            certain Cuban promises and assurances. On the other hand, the
                            performance of the Cuban Government with regard to its obligations,
                            commercial and Government, is on the whole as good as that of any of the
                            other American republics and it has met its debt payments, et cetera,
                            without any assistance through recent loans. The program suggested and
                            proposed in the memorandum of the Minister of State provides, I believe,
                            a quite safe and in many respects sound basis for mutual fulfilment and
                            a program which I believe the Cuban Government will be required to meet.
                            It is, I believe, the only basis on which we can proceed at this time
                            unless we wish to be faced by a situation in which direct or indirect
                            intervention will become necessary for reasons of political security and
                            defense.</p>

                            Cuba, along the following lines:</p>
                        <p>1. The extension of sugar financing should assist immediately and
                            significantly in meeting the crisis in Cuba’s most important industry
                            and in maintaining the Cuban economy. This action evidences the
                            cooperative attitude of the Government of the United States, and should
                            contribute to the prestige of the present Government of Cuba.</p>
                        <p>2. The United States Government is prepared to enter into the other
                            fields of economic cooperation which have been discussed in the past.
                            Before it does so, it believes that the Cuban Government should by
                            actual accomplishment give evidence of its often expressed intention of
                            settling satisfactorily certain problems outstanding between the two
                            nations and of carrying out certain essential and desirable measures.

                            contemplation of 400,000 Spanish long tons, it did not seem advisable to
                            discuss credits for agricultural diversification, public works, and
                            cooperation along other lines, immediately on receipt of the

                            not until Monday, February 10, that I thought it advisable to act on
                            these instructions.</p>
                        <p>For my own guidance with the Minister of State, I had prepared a
                            memorandum based upon the Department’s instructions Nos. 421 and 463, of
                            which memorandum I submit herewith a copy.<note n="54" xml:id="d137fn54"
                                >Not printed.</note> I began my conversation with the Minister by
                            conveying to him orally, in Spanish, the contents of this memorandum
                            following the text herewith transmitted.</p>
                        <p>The Minister expressed his satisfaction that it would be possible to
                            continue the discussions on credits for agricultural diversification and
                            public works and on the possibility of establishing a central bank with
                            facilities for granting credits to agriculture. He said that he had just
                            completed the message which the President would send to the Congress on
                            the legislation necessary by the Cuban Congress in order to carry the
                            sugar arrangement into effect and that he had every hope that this
                            arrangement would soon be satisfactorily carried through. I took
                            occasion at this point to say to him that, in connection with the sugar
                            arrangement, I was sure he would keep in mind that the offer of the
                            Export-Import Bank to carry through this sugar financing was based <pb
                                n="138" xml:id="pg_138" facs="0146"/>on two fundamental
                            considerations; first, that the crop this year should not exceed
                            2,400,000 tons, and, second, that the Cuban Government would extend
                            Decree-Law 522 without substantial alteration. I emphasized that,
                            although my Government was prepared to continue the consideration of
                            agricultural and public works credits independently of the action which
                            might be taken on this sugar financing, one of the indispensable
                            preliminaries to such consideration would be the prolongation of
                            Decree-Law 522 without substantial alteration.</p>
                        <p>The Minister said he understood this situation but that he did not
                            consider, and the Cuban Government did not consider, the sugar financing
                            arrangement as a part of our conversations on economic cooperation in
                            the same sense as the agricultural and public works credits. The sugar
                            arrangement was made at the request of the Cuban Government but was more
                            a purely financial operation on a purely banking basis. It was an
                            arrangement of primary and urgently immediate importance to the Cuban
                            economy, but he hoped that this arrangement which involved the lending
                            by the bank of some $12,000,000, would not interfere with the granting
                            of agricultural diversification and public works credits by the bank in
                            an adequate amount.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the conditions which my Government had set forth as being
                            indispensable with respect to the granting of credits for agricultural
                            diversification and public works, the Minister made the following
                            observations which he indicated were of a purely preliminary character.
                            The Cuban Government had, by action of the Cuban Congress, passed the
                            Gold Obligations Law which removed from the relationships between our
                            two countries this longstanding and disturbing question. The provisions
                            of the law were being carried through and the bonds would shortly be
                            issued to the creditors. He remarked that since these instructions,
                            which we were discussing, had been given to me, there had been a very
                            considerable change in the Cuban internal situation which, in his
                            opinion, should go far towards satisfying our Government and in giving
                            it increased assurance. The authority of the civil Government had been
                            reestablished in a definite form. The Fourth of September 1933<note

                            of the Government, which had been in the hands of the Army and the Navy,
                            had been returned to the appropriate civil administrations. The most
                            definite instructions had been issued to stop the malpractices in the
                            Army and Navy and in the Customs, which had led to the diversion of
                            revenues.</p>
                        <pb n="139" xml:id="pg_139" facs="0147"/>
                        <p>With respect to the Morris claim, he stated that there should be no
                            difficulty in reaching a solution. There was a decision of the Supreme
                            Court in this case and there was an obligation of the Cuban Government
                            to settle this matter by negotiation with the creditors without delay. I
                            pointed out to him various reasons indicating the importance of the
                            settlement of the Morris claim without any delay, which considerations
                            the Minister understood and appreciated.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the examination, and provision for eventual liquidation
                            of other United States claims, he stated that these were matters which
                            would have to be gone into by the Cuban Government, but said that this
                            matter would have to be approached with great care. He said that if it
                            became known that the Cuban Government was examining old and outstanding
                            claims against it by American citizens and interests, it would result in
                            the resurrection and pressing of many claims for which there was no
                            foundation whatever. In this connection, I limited myself to saying that
                            it was the opinion of my Government that these claims, as well as the
                            Morris claim, should receive immediate consideration by the Cuban
                            Government in such a form as to indicate the intention of the Cuban
                            Government to proceed with settlement thereof.</p>
                        <p>With respect to further manipulation of the direct consumption sugar
                            quotas prejudicial to American mills with refineries in Cuba, the
                            Minister stated that this matter had been receiving his attention since
                            I had left with him a few days before a memorandum calling his attention
                            to two decrees issued by the Cuban Government in the last days of the
                            Presidency of Dr. Laredo Brú. In this memorandum which I had left with
                            the Minister I had brought to his attention the resolution of the Sugar
                            Stabilization Institute requesting the Cuban Government to abrogate
                            these two decrees which had worked out prejudicial to American
                            interests. The Minister said that he saw no difficulty in appropriate
                            action being taken by the Cuban Government to prevent further
                            manipulation of the direct consumption sugar quotas which would be
                            prejudicial to the interests of American mills with refineries in
                            Cuba.</p>
                        <p>With respect to reform and reorganization of the fiscal system in
                            administration, the Minister stated that I was familiar with the steps
                            which the Cuban Government was already taking. The decree placing
                            certain administrative functions formerly in the Army and Navy and
                            Customs was an important step. A committee had been set up which was
                            studying economic problems and reform of the fiscal and tax system. The
                            Secretary of the Treasury was a man of unimpeachable honesty. The
                            Government was determined to carry through the necessary fiscal and
                            administrative reforms.</p>
                        <pb n="140" xml:id="pg_140" facs="0148"/>
                        <p>With respect to the net reduction in actual budgetary expenditures by
                            approximately 7,000,000 pesos, the Minister said that the Government was
                            giving this matter of the budget and reductions therein its earnest
                            attention. It had already been decided to change the Cuban fiscal year
                            from the calendar year to a fiscal year beginning July 1 every year.
                            There were certain reductions in the budget which would have to be made
                            in view of the financial situation of the Government. There were
                            increases in items of the budget which would have to be made because of
                            constitutional prescriptions which would have to be carried through. The
                            Government realized that it would have to fix its budget in a manner
                            which would involve payment of expenditures through receipts and without
                            dependence on internal or external loans. It was now studying proposals
                            for tax increases which had been made by committees set up for this
                            purpose. It was too early to state just what could be done, but he hoped
                            that we would not insist on any arbitrary figure or reductions.</p>
                        <p>The Minister expressed his belief that it was desirable to begin as soon
                            as possible studies with the collaboration of our Government, and on the
                            basis of the offer made, which would form the basis for the
                            establishment of a central bank and facilities for extending
                            agricultural credits. No aid to Cuba, he said, in his opinion, would be
                            properly effective and adequately fruitful unless such banking
                            facilities were provided for. I said in this connection that I did not
                            believe that it was the intention of my Government that its
                            collaboration in the making of such studies was dependent upon the
                            fulfillment of the conditions which had been set forth with respect to
                            the granting of credits for agricultural diversification and public
                            works. I believed that I could assure him that we would be prepared at
                            any time, on the request of the Cuban Government, to make available
                            experts of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve System, and the Farm Credit
                            Administration, to assist the Cuban Government in the preparation of a
                            complete plan for the reorganization of the monetary banking and
                            exchange systems including agricultural credits.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the treaty of residence and establishment, I emphasized
                            to the Minister that my Government had received no reply or comment on
                            the proposal for such a treaty which we had submitted to the Cuban
                            Government in March 1939.<note n="56" xml:id="d137fn56">See footnote 52,
                                    <ref target="#pg_135">p. 135</ref>.</note> I did not believe
                            that my Government would make the beginning of negotiations for such a
                            treaty dependent upon the fulfillment of the considerations which had
                            been set forth. I expressed the opinion that my Government would be
                            prepared to begin the negotiation of such a treaty immediately. As the
                            first step, I suggested that it would be desirable for the Cuban
                            Government to address a note to my Government, either <pb n="141"
                                xml:id="pg_141" facs="0149"/>through this Embassy or through the
                            Cuban Embassy in Washington, acknowledging this proposal of my
                            Government made in March 1939, and stating that the matter was being
                            considered by the Cuban Government which hoped very shortly to submit
                            its detailed comment. The Minister said that he saw no reason for not
                            proceeding with urgency on the negotiation of such a treaty and could
                            foresee no reason why a mutually satisfactory treaty should not be
                            completed rapidly.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the negotiation of a limited supplementary trade
                            agreement, the Minister expressed his desire that something be done in
                            this direction without delay. I told him that the matter could be
                            initiated by his addressing a note to the Embassy, or through the Cuban
                            Embassy with the Department, requesting on behalf of the Cuban
                            Government the negotiation of a supplementary trade agreement. I said
                            that in this connection the Cuban Government could mention its
                            memorandum of December 27, 1940.<note n="57" xml:id="d137fn57">Not
                                printed.</note></p>
                        <p>I said that so far as I knew, I did not believe that the opening of the
                            negotiations for a supplementary trade agreement was dependent upon the
                            fulfillment of the conditions which had been set forth for the granting
                            of credits for agricultural diversification and public works.</p>
                        <p>The foregoing conversation lasted several hours and the Minister
                            expressed a desire, before I saw the President on the basis of my
                            instructions, that I would have a further conversation with him. He said
                            that he wished to consider the substance of the statements which I had
                            been good enough to convey on behalf of my Government and to discuss the
                            various items further with me before I saw the President. I said that I
                            saw no inconvenience in this and that I was prepared to resume the
                            conversation at any time he desired.</p>
                        <p>The foregoing observations on the conversation with the Minister should I
                            believe, therefore, be considered by the Department as preliminary in
                            character. In my next conversation with him, I will be able to enter
                            into greater detail on various items under my instructions.</p>
                        <p>I may say that I considered the conversation, on which I am reporting in
                            this despatch, as of a satisfactory character.</p>
                        <p>Respectfully yours,</p>

                        <p>In the foregoing connection there is enclosed, for information purposes,
                            copy of a memorandum on the “Status of the Cooperative Economic Program

                            the Foreign Minister as to the desirability of a global commitment for
                            financing individual projects as they are approved by the Export-Import
                            Bank, and is prepared, provided agreement can be reached with the Cuban
                            Government on the general categories under the global commitment, to
                            recommend to the Federal Loan Agency public announcement of a commitment
                            of $30,000,000. The Department would of course expect inclusion within
                            this amount of the cost of the rehabilitation of the Habana water works.
                            As you are aware, the Export-Import Bank will require the Cuban
                            Government’s guarantee of the credit to the Municipality.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of the Department’s strictly confidential instruction No. 563 of
                            March 25, 1941, and have noted carefully the directives given therein
                            for my guidance in further conversations with the Cuban Government in
                            the matter of financial and economic cooperation. I am in agreement with
                            the Department that the time has arrived when these conversations may be
                            renewed on a definite basis.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the Habana waterworks, the Department transmits a letter
                            from the Deputy Federal Loan Administrator to the Mayor of Habana on the
                            subject of a credit for the Habana waterworks project, and I am
                            instructed to deliver this letter to the Minister of State, for
                            transmission to the Mayor of Habana, as soon as an agreement upon the
                            settlement of the Morris Claim is reached. I shall, therefore, not
                            deliver this letter to the Minister of State for the present, and not
                            until there is information with regard to adequate progress on the
                            settlement of the Morris Claim.</p>
                        <p>As I interpret the Department’s instruction, our Government is prepared,
                            provided agreement can be reached with the Cuban Government on the
                            general categories under the global commitment, to recommend to the
                            Federal Loan Agency public announcement of a commitment of $30,000,000,
                            and that the Department would, of course, expect inclusion within this
                            amount of the cost of the rehabilitation of the Habana waterworks. I
                            note that the Export-Import Bank will require the Cuban Government’s
                            guarantee of the credit to the Municipality for the waterworks
                            rehabilitation. It is further my understanding that a preliminary
                            condition to this action by the Department <pb n="144" xml:id="pg_144"
                                facs="0152"/>would be an agreement upon the settlement of the Morris
                            Claim, as it is believed by our Government that in other respects
                            adequate progress has been made in the matters which I brought to the
                            attention of the President of Cuba and the Minister of State in accord
                            with the Department’s instruction No. 421 of January 11, 1941.</p>
                        <p>With specific reference to the Morris Claim, I have reported to the
                            Department that I have on several occasions discussed this with the
                            President and the Minister of State, and both of them have indicated
                            their full agreement that this matter should be settled without delay.
                            The Minister of State informed me the other day that while the Cuban
                            Ambassador, Dr. Concheso, was here, he would instruct him immediately on
                            his return to Washington to take up the Morris Claim with the claimants
                            or their representatives in order to arrive at a settlement. During his
                            brief stay here, the Cuban Ambassador came in to see me and informed me
                            that the President and the Minister of State had instructed him to take
                            up this matter of the settlement of the Morris Claim immediately on his
                            return to Washington and to bring it to a satisfactory conclusion.</p>
                        <p>The Department is aware that I have in an informal manner during the past
                            few months been in constant contact with the Minister of State on these
                            matters of financial and economic cooperation. He has on several
                            occasions recently informed me that he is preparing a memorandum for
                            submission to our Government, through this Embassy, covering the various
                            points in the program. There have been many matters of a purely
                            internal, but pressing, character which have required the immediate
                            attention of the Minister of State, in spite of the importance and
                            pressing nature of the financial and economic assistance which Cuba
                            needs. I think this delay in the delivery of this communication by the
                            Minister of State must be attributed to the unusual pressure under which
                            he has been working. He informed me on several occasions during the last
                            week that he was working on this memorandum and hoped any day to discuss
                            it with me prior to putting it into final form.</p>
                        <p>In view of the foregoing, I have not raised with the Minister of State
                            the concrete questions set forth in the Department’s instruction No. 563
                            of March 25, 1941. I believe that I can more effectively do so when he
                            renews these conversations. I shall, when we take up this matter
                            together, secure the information desired under points 2, 3 and 4 in the
                            Department’s instruction No. 563.</p>
                        <p>There is one point on which I would desire to make the following comment
                            at this time. The Department states that it is prepared to recommend to
                            the Federal Loan Agency public announcement of a commitment of
                            $30,000,000, which would include the cost of the rehabilitation of the
                            Habana waterworks. As the cost of the waterworks <pb n="145"
                                xml:id="pg_145" facs="0153"/>project is estimated variously as from
                            $8,000,000 to $12,000,000, and as the cost would undoubtedly be nearer
                            the latter figure, this would leave only $18,000,000 for agricultural
                            diversification and public works projects in which the Government of
                            Cuba is primarily interested. If the Government should desire the budget
                            loan in the amount of $4,000,000, this would reduce the amount available
                            for agricultural diversification and public works to $14,000,000. This,
                            I believe, would be a source of considerable disappointment to the Cuban
                            Government and to the Cuban public, and I would strongly recommend to
                            the Department its consideration of making a recommendation to the
                            Export-Import Bank of a global commitment of $30,000,000, exclusive of
                            the amount needed for the rehabilitation of the Habana waterworks. The
                            Cuban Government has consistently, in its conversations with me, taken
                            the attitude that it desires the Habana waterworks project to be
                            considered as a separate one. It is noted that the Bank will require the
                            guarantee of the Cuban Government of any credit to the Municipality for
                            this project. This is a guarantee which the Cuban Government, I believe,
                            would prefer not to give in view of the autonomy of the Municipality,
                            but I have always considered that the Bank would, in any arrangement
                            with the Municipality, insist upon the guarantee of the Cuban Government
                            of the credit, and I believe this to be a quite proper requirement of
                            the Bank. This, of course, will require legislation by the Cuban
                            Congress. On the other hand, there is some basis for the attitude of the
                            Cuban Government that the credit for the waterworks project should be
                            considered separately and apart from the global credits which may be
                            announced to the Cuban Government for agricultural diversification,
                            public works, etc. Whatever arrangement the Bank reaches with the
                            Municipality with regard to the waterworks project, it will undoubtedly
                            be on a purely commercial basis with very definite requirements such as
                            any private bank would require for amortization of principal and payment
                            of interest.</p>
                        <p>If the approximately $12,000,000, which is needed for the Habana
                            waterworks, is included in the global commitment of $30,000,000, it
                            will, I believe, cause considerable concern to the Cuban Government and
                            the loan will not have the effect on public confidence which it is
                            desired by both Governments it should have.</p>
                        <p>There is the further consideration that the specific commitments and
                            expenditures thereunder, under any credit which we may give to the Cuban
                            Government, will be for important projects to be agreed upon between the
                            two Governments. Although some basic study has been made of these
                            projects, and active steps could be taken with regard to some of them
                            without delay, in the case of others further study would be necessary.
                            Whatever global commitments we may <pb n="146" xml:id="pg_146"
                                facs="0154"/>therefore make in the way of a credit to the Cuban
                            Government, the actual expenditures thereunder would be made only very
                            gradually. This, I believe, should be considered by our Government and
                            the Bank in the consideration of the amount of the global
                            commitment.</p>
                        <p>I therefore respectfully urge the Department to consider the advisability
                            of recommending to the Bank the global commitment of $30,000,000
                            exclusive of the amount which the Bank may be willing to advance for the
                            Habana waterworks project. This action by our Government, I believe, is
                            necessary in order to give the adequate effect to the loan which we wish
                            it to have and which the Cuban Government has consistently pointed out
                            is essential to it. It is obvious that only a part of such global
                            commitment could be immediately used, but the effect would be to
                            strengthen our position here and to strengthen the position of the Cuban
                            Government and to give to the Cuban economy the confidence and impulse
                            which it so definitely needs. It is my hope, therefore, that when we
                            take this important step in our relationships with Cuba, which are
                            progressing so satisfactorily, that we may do so in an adequate and
                            fully effective form in order to reach the ends desired by both
                            Governments. The record of the past few months shows, I believe,
                            conclusively the real desire of the Cuban Government to clean its house
                            as rapidly and as completely as possible, and to cooperate with us fully
                            in other respects, including that of defense.</p>
                        <p>I will particularly appreciate the Department’s immediate consideration
                            of the foregoing recommendation and any observations or instructions
                            which it may be able to give me for my further guidance.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the specific points on which the Department has requested
                            further information, I shall write as soon as I have been able to
                            discuss these matters with the Minister of State.</p>

                            States to cooperate with the Government of Cuba in the establishment <pb

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the series of
                            despatches in which I have reported on the conversations of an informal
                            and exploratory character which I have had with President Batista, and
                            with the Minister of State, Dr. Cortina, with reference to possible
                            economic and financial cooperation between the United States and Cuba,
                            and to transmit herewith a copy of a Memorandum, dated April 15, 1941,
                            together with a translation thereof, which the Minister of State handed
                            to me yesterday, in which the Cuban Government makes a request that as
                            immediate consideration as possible should be given by our Government to
                            the opening of credits for public works and agricultural diversification
                            projects in Cuba. In delivering this Memorandum, which has the specific
                            approval of President Batista and the members of the Cabinet, Dr.
                            Cortina made certain observations with respect to these credits which
                            will be of interest to the Department, but which time does not permit me
                            to convey in this despatch. I am leaving for Washington this evening for
                            consultation and I shall, on my arrival in the Department, give further
                            appropriate background with respect to the observations made by the
                            Minister and with respect to the informal conversations during the past
                            three months.</p>
                        <p>I confine myself at this moment to saying that it is my considered
                            opinion that the Cuban Government has made adequate progress in the
                            fulfilment of the observations which, under the Department’s
                            instructions, I made to President Batista and to the Minister of State,
                            to warrant our proceeding without delay with a determination of the
                            amounts of the credits to be extended. It would not, in my opinion, <pb
                                n="148" xml:id="pg_148" facs="0156"/>be wise to delay concrete and
                            formal action with regard to these credits.</p>

                                    States of America, through the Export-Import Bank, was expressed

                                    the repeated expression of good will and economic cooperation
                                    offered by the Government of the United States of America, in an
                                    explicit manner; and therefore we believe that the time has come
                                    to concrete the real and practical possibility of said
                                    cooperation.</item>

                                    financing, so that this may be brought about. Any other method,
                                    in addition to being complicated of itself, would lead us to
                                    extended delays and to an evident confusion of problems.</item>

                                    of a loan, a financing or a credit, to be used for agricultural
                                    development and public works. We believe the essential point of
                                    this operation is to agree on the form of payment and the
                                    security which the Government of Cuba should give in order that
                                    the Export-Import Bank may grant it the said credits. This is
                                    the method that has always been followed in negotiations between
                                    Cuba and the United States, and we see no special reason for the
                                    abandonment of this method, through which, up to the present
                                    time it has been possible to agree satisfactorily, between the
                                    Government of Cuba and that of the United States of America,
                                    upon all matters of this nature.</item>
                                <label>5.</label>
                                <item>—However, we see no objection in declaring that we are willing
                                    to have the Cuban Ambassador to the United States proceed to get
                                    in contact with the representatives of the so called Morris
                                    claim, in order to reach with them an agreement as to payment
                                    that may be satisfactory to both parties. We do this because it
                                    is the criterion of this Government at all times to liquidate
                                    such obligations as have <pb n="149" xml:id="pg_149" facs="0157"
                                    />been properly clarified and fixed by the Courts of Justice,
                                    and there is no doubt that this is the case with regard to the
                                    Morris claim.</item>

                                <item>—We believe that the matter of the reduction of budgetary
                                    expenditures is a very complex problem which the Government of
                                    the United States cannot fail to appreciate is closely connected
                                    with the European war, with deep social problems and with local
                                    circumstances and special conditions of each country, that
                                    cannot be judged hastily and easily through the negotiation of a
                                    loan, but that these matters should be left to the initiative of
                                    each Government itself according to a better knowledge of its
                                    interests and with the upright intention, which every honest
                                    Government should have, of properly administering its affairs.
                                    Naturally, the Government of Cuba, as is the case with the
                                    Government of the United States itself, has the intention of
                                    eliminating every expense that it may be possible to eliminate
                                    or which may be unnecessary, and to reduce the amount of the
                                    budget in the measure and form that the national needs may
                                    permit.</item>
                                <label>7.</label>
                                <item>—To this end the Government of Cuba has already taken and will
                                    continue to take every action of a fiscal nature or
                                    administrative character which it might consider necessary for
                                    its purpose of good administration. The recent activities of the
                                    President, Colonel Fulgencio Batista are well known, whose
                                    energetic action to eliminate high officials and correct
                                    deficiencies in the administration of the State have received
                                    international cognizance and have merited the warm
                                    congratulation of the Government of the United States of
                                    America. We believe that in this respect there is absolute proof
                                    of the firm purpose of the Government of maintaining and
                                    carrying forward an efficient, upright and competent
                                    administration.</item>

                                <item>—With respect to the possibility of appointing a commission to
                                    convoke all the possible claimants of the Government of Cuba
                                    that there might be among American citizens, we believe this to
                                    be absolutely unnecessary, because we have no information with
                                    regard to any appreciable or important claim made upon the
                                    Government of Cuba by any American citizen, that has not been
                                    settled, with the exception of the Morris claim.</item>

                                <item>—The Government of Cuba can take pride in saying that it
                                    figures among the first of Spanish-America, in so far as regards
                                    the satisfactory solution with the Government of the United
                                    States of all pending claims, and it cannot be possible to
                                    forget that Cuba was the first nation to pay the total of its
                                    war debt to the United States of America; as well as that the so
                                    called Public Works bonds and obligations have already been the
                                    subject of full and satisfactory liquidation, that they are
                                    earning their respective interest and are in a completely normal
                                    state.</item>

                                    difficulties and its international effect would place Cuba in a
                                    position of inferiority, making it appear as a constant field of
                                    claims which do not exist; a situation that is not reasonable,
                                    due to the foregoing arguments.</item>

                                    by an American citizen, this Government will give it immediate
                                    consideration. We believe, therefore, that any project calling
                                    for special commissions for the purpose of convoking claimants,
                                    should be abandoned.</item>

                                    negotiation of which was started some time ago, the Cuban
                                    Government will, in turn shortly, formulate the remarks that it

                                    between both countries. It is our intention to handle the
                                    discussion of this negotiation in a relatively rapid and
                                    effective manner.</item>

                                    mills, with regard to the so called refined or direct
                                    consumption sugar, the Government of Cuba has no inconvenience
                                    in assuring that it will maintain the American mills in the same
                                    proportion in which they have been enjoying this advantage. And
                                    with reference to the other sugar problems, in the Law for the
                                    financing of the 400,000 tons, the Government and Congress of
                                    Cuba, heeding the wishes of the Government of the United States,
                                    has indefinitely extended the life of Decree-Law No. 522 which
                                    regulates the quota system and the Sugar Institute. This has
                                    been done to the complete satisfaction of the American and Cuban
                                    sugar producers and of the Government of the United States, and
                                    we are pleased to advise that this extension and provision has
                                    been requested on repeated occasions by the Government of the
                                    United States, which has given extraordinary importance to the
                                    same and has expressed, that once these were in force, the
                                    pending economic problems would find an easy and rapid solution.
                                    This has been done by the Government of Cuba in strict
                                    fulfilment of the promises exchanged by the Foreign

                                            Government of Cuba, greatly appreciating the good will
                                            of the Government of the United States, has no objection
                                            to lend its good offices to the end that the Habana City

                                            negotiation with the Export-Import Bank, leading to the
                                            financing of that important and necessary sanitary work,
                                            although it does not wish that the credit granted

                                            logical to have the payment for this work, which is
                                            amply secured, be deducted from the credit that is

                            especially its relation to the United States. It believes that the
                            following points are significant: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>Cuba is a very important market for United States goods and
                                    supplier of essential imports. In 1940 Cuba was the eleventh
                                    best customer of the United States, importing from us
                                    $79,600,000 of goods out of total Cuban imports of $103,900,000.
                                    In the same year Cuba was the sixth most important supplier of
                                    our own imports, exporting to the United States $104,900,000 out
                                    of total Cuban exports of $127,300,000. All of this trade is
                                    carried on freely; there is no restriction of exchange
                                    transfers, or delay in payment.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>Cuba is the most important field for United States investment
                                    in the other American Republics. The Commerce Department has
                                    estimated United States investments in Cuba at $733,000,000, or
                                    19% of total investments in Latin America. These investments are
                                    not subject to any unusual forms of control by the Government of
                                    Cuba, and remittance of interest dividends, and other services
                                    is entirely free.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>The public debt record of Cuba is good. A large portion of the
                                    dollar obligations of the national government have been
                                    regularly serviced throughout the last twelve years, while all
                                    of the rest have been settled by agreements with the bondholders
                                    which are currently being kept scrupulously.</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>Other claims of American citizens are being handled in a
                                    satisfactory manner. The Cuban Government last fall settled the
                                    so-called gold obligations held by Warren Brothers and other
                                    public works contractors. It has given orders that a settlement
                                    be reached with the claimants in regard to the so-called Morris
                                    Claim. It has indicated a willingness to receive and discuss any
                                    other claims of Americans which may be brought forward.</item>

                                    recently given indication of its friendly and cooperative

                                <item>The Government of Cuba has demonstrated a firm determination
                                    to reorganize and reform the administrative machinery. It is
                                    returning to the civil authorities the powers exercised by the
                                    military following the Revolution of 1933; it is emphasizing
                                    full democratic processes of law; and it has ousted the
                                    unsatisfactory superior officers of the Army and Navy replacing
                                    them with competent respected individuals.</item>

                                <item>The Government of Cuba is attacking the fiscal problem,
                                    studying methods to improve tax collections and accounting, and
                                    has introduced in the Congress a bill calling for new taxes
                                    which would raise, it is estimated, over $7,000,000 in
                                    additional revenues.</item>
                                <label>8.</label>
                                <item>The Government of Cuba is in all ways cooperating fully with
                                    the United States in matters of the military defense of the
                                    hemisphere.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>In view of all of these and other considerations, and after careful study
                            of the Cuban requests and the individual projects of development and
                            diversification which have been proposed, the Department believes that
                            the time is now opportune for a broad program of economic cooperation
                            with Cuba, and recommends that the Export-Import Bank immediately open a
                            line of credit to the Government of Cuba totaling $30,000,000. Feeling
                            strongly that this Government should do everything in its power to
                            assist in the long range development of the economic resources of Cuba,
                            it suggests that up to $15,000,000 of this amount be allocated to
                            projects of agricultural development and diversification including
                            irrigation works and agricultural roads. In this connection, attention
                            is called to the recently completed study and detailed recommendations
                            regarding Cuban agriculture made by a survey party of the Department of
                            Agriculture. Copies of this report have been made available to the
                            Export-Import Bank and Mr. W. L. Clayton, Deputy Federal Loan
                            Administrator.</p>
                        <p>The Department further suggests that up to $10,000,000 be allocated to
                            other types of public works—water supply systems, sanitation projects,
                            highways, et cetera—to be carried out by the national government. All of
                            these would, of course, be subject to the specific examination and
                            approval of the Export-Import Bank.</p>
                        <p>Finally, the Department agrees with the Government of Cuba that the
                            amplification of agricultural credit facilities is of the greatest
                            importance in a program of agricultural development and diversification.
                                <pb n="156" xml:id="pg_156" facs="0164"/>The report of the
                            Department of Agriculture survey party mentioned above devotes a full
                            section to this subject. The Department does not wish to put forward at
                            this time a specific plan for agricultural credit, but suggests that the
                            remaining $5,000,000 be set aside for this purpose, to be utilized only
                            with the full approval of the Export-Import Bank for a system for
                            agricultural credit established by the Government of Cuba with the
                            advice and assistance of technical experts of this Government.</p>
                        <p>The Department believes that it is most desirable that public
                            announcement of cooperative arrangements between the United States and
                            Cuba be made at the earliest possible date, and hopes that the
                            Export-Import Bank will give prompt consideration to the economic
                            program suggested above.</p>

                        <p>A meeting was held to discuss the type and amount of financial assistance
                            to Cuba which the Department would request of the Export-Import Bank.
                            Ambassador Messersmith appeared satisfied with the recommendation of the
                            Division that the Bank be requested to make a commitment up to
                            $25,000,000 for agricultural development and diversification and public
                            works and a tentative commitment of $5,000,000 for eventual
                            establishment of a central bank. The question of the Habana water works
                            which the bank is known to consider as a very much worth while project
                            was left for later consideration, Ambassador Messersmith having stated
                            that the letter from the Bank to the Mayor of Habana approving the
                            project in principle had not been delivered because of the
                            undesirability of giving preference to the municipal government’s
                            request over the request of the central government.</p>
                        <pb n="157" xml:id="pg_157" facs="0165"/>
                        <p>In going over the problem of financial assistance the question was
                            brought up of amortization terms. Ambassador Messersmith pointed out
                            that the advances for long-term projects such as water works must be
                            given amortization terms considerably longer than the bank has been
                            giving up to now. A letter from the Under Secretary to Mr. Jones
                            recommending the credits along the lines indicated above was approved by
                            the meeting and immediately signed by the Under Secretary. Ambassador
                            Messersmith planned to deliver the letter personally that afternoon.</p>
                        <p>In the course of the discussion the Under Secretary stressed the
                            importance of keeping out hare-brained “turismo” projects from among
                            those which the Cuban Government might endeavor to present. Thought
                            should however be given, the Under Secretary added, to the desirability
                            of eventually building a first-class hotel at Varadero Beach.</p>

                        <p>Following conversations over the past several months between Cuban
                            authorities and officials of the United States Government, the
                            Export-Import Bank has established a credit of $25,000,000 to be availed
                            of by the Cuban Government to finance the purchase of materials,
                            equipment and services required in the Republic of Cuba for agricultural
                            development and diversification and public or other useful works
                            projects, including irrigation systems, highways, and sanitation works
                            throughout the Island of Cuba.</p>
                        <p>This commitment, which was made by the Executive Committee of the
                            Export-Import Bank on May 1, is a further step forward in the
                            development of a program of economic collaboration between Cuba and the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>Funds will be advanced under this credit as individual projects are
                            studied and approved by the appropriate authorities of the two
                            Governments. The precise terms of the arrangement will be worked out by
                            representatives of the Cuban Government and the Bank.</p>

                            correspondence with the Department relating to the desire of the Cuban
                            Government to secure <pb n="158" xml:id="pg_158" facs="0166"/>a credit
                            from the Export-Import Bank for agricultural diversification and public
                            works projects, and particularly to my despatch No. 1914 of April 20,
                            1941, with which was transmitted a copy of a note from the Cuban
                            Government, dated April 15, 1941, requesting a credit of $30,000,000 for
                            public works and agricultural diversification projects and requesting
                            favorable consideration by the Export-Import Bank of the financing of
                            the rehabilitation of the Habana waterworks. In this connection, I also
                            have to refer to my despatches, No. 1910 of April 20, 1941,<note n="70"

                            a reduction of fifteen points in the customs duties paid by Cuban sugar
                            on entry into the United States.</p>
                        <p>During my recent stay in Washington on consultation, under instructions
                            of the Department, I was able to discuss the notes and memoranda,
                            referred to in the above-mentioned despatches, with officers of the
                            Department and of the Export-Import Bank. It will be recalled that after
                            appropriate discussion in the Department, a letter was addressed by the
                            Department to the Federal Loan Administrator strongly recommending that
                            the Bank open a credit of $30,000,000 in favor of the Cuban Government
                            of which $25,000,000 would be devoted to agricultural diversification
                            and public works projects and $5,000,000 for the purpose of aiding in
                            the establishment of a central bank in Cuba with agricultural credit
                            facilities. The Department also in this letter strongly recommended to
                            the Bank for its favorable consideration the opening of a credit for the
                            rehabilitation of the Habana waterworks, this being in addition to the
                            recommendation made for agricultural diversification, public works, and
                            the central bank.</p>
                        <p>After thorough discussion of these recommendations with the officials of
                            the Export-Import Bank, the Bank at a meeting of its Executive Board
                            last week decided to extend a credit of $25,000,000 to the Cuban
                            Government for agricultural diversification and public works projects,
                            an announcement of which credit was to be made at a time in the near
                            future to be agreed upon between the Bank and the Cuban Government. The
                            Bank did not deem it advisable at that time to make a definite
                            commitment with regard to the assistance which it could render in the
                            establishment of a central bank with agricultural credit facilities, in
                            so far as the amount involved was concerned. It did, however, go on
                            record as expressing itself sympathetic to this <pb n="159"
                                xml:id="pg_159" facs="0167"/>project and willing to aid therein to
                            the amount of $5,000,000 when and if proper and acceptable plans for the
                            organization of such a bank had been made. The Bank expressed its
                            approval that its attitude in this respect be communicated
                            confidentially to the Cuban Government, but it did not wish any public
                            announcement of any kind to be made with respect to its willingness to
                            consider and to aid in the establishment of such a bank.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the rehabilitation of the Habana waterworks, the Bank
                            stated its willingness to consider sympathetically and favorably an
                            application from the Mayor and Municipality of Habana for a credit to
                            the Municipality for this purpose. The Bank stated that it had not
                            received as yet a formal application from the Municipality of Habana for
                            the consideration of this matter and stated that the Cuban Government
                            and the Mayor of Habana could be informed that a formal application
                            would receive consideration.</p>
                        <p>The Cuban Government, in the communications above referred to, had also
                            requested consideration by our Government of a reduction of fifteen
                            points in the customs duties paid by Cuban sugar on admission into the
                            United States; more favorable treatment for Cuban sugar in general; and
                            more favorable consideration of importations of tobacco, cigars and
                            cattle. These matters had already been under consideration by the
                            Department of State and I had conversations with the Secretary, the
                            Undersecretary, and with the officers of the Division of American
                            Republics, and of the Division of Commercial Agreements in the
                            Department with respect thereto. In these conversations I emphasized the
                            importance and immediate necessity, in the opinion of this Embassy, of
                            as favorable consideration as possible being given to the requests of
                            the Cuban Government. I found these views shared in the Department, and
                            the steps which were being taken in the Department were indicated to me.
                            These steps took the form of the preliminaries for the negotiation of a
                            supplementary trade agreement in which the Cuban desires would be met as
                            far as possible. The Division of Commercial Agreements indicated that
                            the Inter-Departmental Committee on Commercial Policy had approved<note
                                n="72a" xml:id="d145fn72a">Properly should read “had recommended”,
                                since only the President could approve.</note> a reduction of
                            fifteen points in the duty on Cuban sugar, after going into the matter
                            both from the political and economic factors involved. With respect to
                            tobacco, it was hoped that some concession favorable to Cuba could be
                            worked out. It was indicated that the Cuban request for the
                            stabilization of the sugar quota, which is so highly desirable in the
                            best interests of both Cuba and the United States, could not receive
                            consideration now as this would involve action by the Congress. With
                            respect to cattle, it was pointed out that there was no hindrance to <pb
                                n="160" xml:id="pg_160" facs="0168"/>the importation of fresh and
                            frozen meats from Cuba and that the question of the importation of live
                            cattle would be gone into, and would be largely resolved by the action
                            taken by the Cuban Government in establishing tick-free zones.</p>
                        <p>The opportunity which I had while in the Department to discuss these
                            matters was of great value to me and I appreciate particularly the
                            considerable time which the officers of the Department were able to give
                            to these matters in spite of the many heavy burdens resting upon
                            them.</p>
                        <p>In order that there should be no misunderstandings with respect to what I
                            could say to the Cuban Government on my return to Cuba, a meeting was
                            held in the office of Mr. Bonsal, the Chief of the Division of American
                            Republics, at which were present—in addition to Mr. Bonsal—Mr.
                                Duggan,<note n="73" xml:id="d145fn73">Laurence Duggan, Adviser on
                                Political Relations.</note> Mr. Collado and Mr. Walmsley.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed that on my return I could say to the Cuban Government the
                            following:</p>
                        <p>1. The Export-Import Bank has agreed to give to the Cuban Government a
                            credit of $25,000,000 for the purpose of financing agricultural
                            diversification and public works projects. There is no division in this
                            amount as to the portion to be devoted to public works and to
                            agricultural diversification. It is believed by the Department and by
                            the Bank that it is in the interests of both Governments that there
                            should be no arbitrary division as to the amount to be devoted to the
                            one or to the other purpose.</p>
                        <p>The projects to be embarked upon are to be approved by the Cuban
                            Government and by the Bank. No part of the credit shall be issued for a
                            project which has not been approved by both the Bank and the Cuban
                            Government. For this purpose, the Bank will use the cooperation of the
                            Department of Agriculture and of such other Departments of our
                            Government as it will see fit, both in the study and selection, as well
                            as in the approval, of projects, and in certain supervisory measures
                            which it may deem desirable and necessary.</p>
                        <p>In view of the practice of the Bank not to extend credits for more than
                            ten years, the credit shall be for a period of ten years and the sums
                            advanced shall bear interest at the rate of four percent. Interest and
                            amortization periods of ten years shall begin in each case with the
                            amount or amounts actually advanced to the Cuban Government for the
                            inauguration and carrying through of approved projects. The credit shall
                            be amortized in such a manner that each advance shall be repayable in
                            nineteen semi-annual instalments, each in the amount of two-and-one-half
                            percent of the advance, the first instalment to become due and payable
                            not later than six months from the date of the advance.</p>
                        <pb n="161" xml:id="pg_161" facs="0169"/>
                        <p>In view of the fact that this arrangement contemplates the amortization
                            of one-half of the loan in equal semi-annual payments over a period of
                            ten years and a final payment at the end of ten years of 52½ percent,
                            the Bank recognizes that for so considerable a loan the period of
                            amortization is short and a heavy burden on the Cuban economy and
                            budget. The Bank has therefore written me a letter, dated May 2, 1941,
                            of which a copy is hereto attached,<note n="74" xml:id="d145fn74">Not
                                printed.</note> stating that if when payment of the last half
                            becomes due at the end of ten years, it is not convenient for the Cuban
                            Government to pay this considerable sum, consideration will be given to
                            an extension provided all maturities have been met.</p>
                        <p>An appropriate bill for presentation to the Cuban Congress guaranteeing
                            the loan, etc., must be drawn up and enacted before any advance can be
                            made under this credit. Announcement of the credit of $25,000,000 is to
                            be made by the Bank and by the Cuban Government simultaneously not later
                            than Wednesday, May 7th, and it is understood that after I have returned
                            to Habana on Tuesday, May 6th, and appropriately informed the Cuban
                            Government of the foregoing, I will telephone the Department of State to
                            indicate the hour, on May 7th, when the simultaneous announcement may be
                            made. To this end a press release to serve as the basis of such
                            announcement was agreed upon by the Department and by the Bank, and of
                            which a copy is to be carried by me to Habana.</p>
                        <p>2. With respect to the memorandum of the Cuban Government requesting our
                            favorable consideration of assistance in the organization and capital of
                            a central bank with agricultural credit facilities, I am to say to the
                            Cuban Government that our Government in principle views the
                            establishment of such a bank with sympathy. I may say specifically that
                            the Export-Import Bank views with sympathy the establishment of such a
                            bank and is prepared to collaborate eventually in the organization of
                            such a bank and in furnishing a part of the necessary capital therefor.
                            The Bank, however, wishes this information to be kept in confidence by
                            the Cuban Government and does not wish any publicity whatever given at
                            this time to its sympathetic attitude. Although the Bank has indicated
                            that in principle it would be prepared to participate in the capital
                            structure of a central bank in the amount of $5,000,000, I will not
                            mention this sum to the Cuban Government. I will say further that when
                            the plans of the Cuban Government for such a bank are submitted to my
                            Government, the project will receive consideration. I will also say that
                            the need for this bank with agricultural credit facilities is not so
                            immediately urgent as its usefulness will become more evident and
                            immediate as <pb n="162" xml:id="pg_162" facs="0170"/>the various
                            projects authorized under the credit of the $25,000,000 are actually in
                            process of being carried through.</p>
                        <p>3. With respect to the Habana waterworks, I will say that the Bank is
                            prepared to look with sympathy and favor on this project which it
                            considers to be one of the most useful which can be carried through in
                            Cuba. I will say that the Bank is prepared to consider this project in
                            addition to the credit of $25,000,000 above mentioned. The Bank has
                            before it no formal application of the Mayor and Municipality of Habana
                            for the consideration of the rehabilitation of the waterworks and that
                            it is prepared to receive such an application. It is to be clear that
                            the Bank has not committed itself to any particular project, but is
                            merely prepared to view with favor and to consider seriously the
                            application of the Municipality of Habana. I am to convey this
                            information to the Cuban Government and to the Mayor of Habana.</p>
                        <p>4. With respect to the desire of the Cuban Government for a reduction of
                            fifteen points in the duty on Cuban sugar, and for consideration of more
                            favorable treatment for certain Cuban products, I may say that our
                            Government is giving serious consideration to the possibility of opening
                            negotiations for a supplementary trade agreement in which these matters
                            can be considered.</p>
                        <p>5. With respect to the request of the Cuban Government for stabilization
                            of the Cuban sugar quota permitted entry into the United States, I am to
                            state that this is a matter requiring legislation by the Congress and
                            cannot therefore receive immediate attention.</p>
                        <p>On my return to Habana on Tuesday morning, May 6th, I got in touch with
                            the Minister of State, Dr. Cortina, and conveyed to him the foregoing
                            listed under points 1 to 5. I had a very long conversation with him
                            particularly with respect to the amortization and budgetary problems
                            involved in the $25,000,000 credit.</p>
                        <p>Later in the day I had a very long conversation with President Batista
                            and Dr. Cortina in which I again went over the statements I was
                            authorized to make and above set forth. The Department will be
                            interested to note as an evidence of good faith of the Cuban Government
                            that the question of amortization and budgetary problems was gone into
                            very carefully by the President and the Minister of State. They were
                            particularly interested in these details and the measures which would be
                            necessary by the Cuban Government in order to properly meet the payments
                            as set forth in the Bank’s offer. In this connection I should state that
                            just before I left Washington I was furnished through the courtesy of
                            the Bank a copy of the Resolution of the Bank authorizing the
                            $25,000,000 credit. I was told at the time, however, that this was not
                            yet an official copy of the Resolution and that there might be some
                            changes therein. A copy thereof would be transmitted to me by the Bank
                            through the Department in due <pb n="163" xml:id="pg_163" facs="0171"
                            />course. I was therefore able to use this preliminary copy of the
                            Resolution only for my informal guidance in the conversations above
                            mentioned, and I could not make direct reference to it. I will
                            appreciate the receipt of a copy of the Resolution of the Bank
                            authorizing the credit as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>During the conversations with the Minister of State and, later, with the
                            President and the Minister of State, on Tuesday, May 6th, I gave them a
                            copy of the press release which the Bank intended to give out on
                            Wednesday, May 7th. It was agreed that I would call on President Batista
                            at the Palace at 11:30 a.m. on May 7th and after this call he would give
                            out a press release at 12 o’clock. As I did not finish the conversation
                            with the President and the Minister of State until after 8 o’clock in
                            the evening of May 6th, it was too late to telephone to the Department
                            to fix the hour of the release for the next day, as had been agreed upon
                            prior to my departure from Washington. On the morning of May 7th I
                            noticed in the morning papers an Associated Press despatch from
                            Washington to the effect that the Bank had made its announcement of the
                            credit on May 6th. When I called on the President at 11:30 on May 7th he
                            was considerably disturbed that the announcement had been made in
                            Washington prior to the Cuban Government being able to make a
                            simultaneous announcement here. I explained to the President that as a
                            result of telephone conversations with the Department that morning I was
                            able to say that this premature statement had been made due to a
                            regrettable and inadvertent misunderstanding.</p>
                        <p>This incident was somewhat unfortunate as the Cuban Government has been
                            refraining most meticulously from any mention of these negotiations with
                            the understanding that we would follow the same course. After the
                            unsuccessful negotiations during the latter part of 1940, which had a
                            very considerable disillusioning effect in Cuba, the Cuban Government
                            and the Cuban press have been silent on the negotiations. It was the
                            particular desire of the Cuban Government, as I had indicated in
                            Washington, that, if the present negotiations were successful, a
                            simultaneous announcement should be made in Washington and in Habana
                            because of the psychological effect. I am merely making reference to
                            this matter to make it clear that the Cuban Government kept full faith
                            in this matter.</p>
                        <p>In my conversation with the President on Wednesday, May 7th, at which no
                            other official of the Cuban Government was present, I touched on the
                            considerable pressure which would be brought on him and on the Cuban
                            Government for all kinds of projects—come good and some bad. He said
                            that he appreciated that he and the Government would have a very real
                            problem. There was so much to be done in various parts of Cuba that
                            there would be all kinds of pressures. <pb n="164" xml:id="pg_164"
                                facs="0172"/>He expressed particular gratification that the Bank had
                            expressed a willingness to consider, in addition to the credit of
                            $25,000,000, the rehabilitation of the Habana waterworks. This would
                            make it possible, he said, for really useful and productive projects to
                            be carried through in all the Provinces, and it was his desire and hope
                            that projects would be approved in all of the Provinces. I took this
                            opportunity again to emphasize not only the importance of the careful
                            selection of the projects by the two Governments, but also the carrying
                            through of the individual projects in such a manner that no criticism
                            could attach thereto. The President said that he was adequately
                            cognizant of this and realized that the success of the program depended
                            thereon.</p>
                        <p>The President expressed the desire that actual progress be made as soon
                            as possible, and he therefore authorized me to discuss directly with the
                            Minister of State a project of law to be approved by the Congress
                            guaranteeing the loan. The preparation of such a draft-law and its
                            approval by the Cuban Congress would take at the best a certain time,
                            particularly as the law would have to be passed in a form satisfactory
                            to the Bank. He expressed the hope, therefore, that while this process
                            was going on, actual work on the study and preliminary selection of
                            projects might be made so that with the approval of the law by the
                            Congress definite approval could immediately be given to certain
                            projects and work thereon started. Unless this were done, he said, there
                            would be a very considerable time which would elapse before the credit
                            could become effective. In this connection I said that, of course, the
                            Bank would not advance any money for particular projects under this
                            credit until after the actual approval of the law by the Cuban Congress.
                            I said that I did not see any reason, however, why certain preliminary
                            studies could not be made by the appropriate officials of both
                            Governments of certain projects without delay. I believed that my
                            Government and the Bank would take this view, but it was a matter which
                            I would have to explore and on which I would have to seek instructions.
                            I am strongly of the opinion that it would be desirable to arrange to
                            begin the study of certain projects without delay. The Minister of State
                            will undoubtedly raise this question with me in the near future and I
                            will then take up this matter with the Department.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the rehabilitation of the Habana waterworks, the
                            President said that he would ask the Mayor of Habana to come to see him
                            today and thereafter ask him to see me<note n="75" xml:id="d145fn75">In
                                despatch No. 2002, May 9, the Ambassador reported a conversation
                                with Dr. Menocal, Mayor of Habana. The Ambassador presented to the
                                Mayor a letter from the Deputy Federal Loan Administrator saying
                                that the Export-Import Bank would be ready to receive a formal
                                application for credit for the rehabilitation of the waterworks of
                                Habana. (837.51 Cooperation Program/71.)</note> in order that the

                            credit for the rehabilitation of the Habana waterworks.</p>
                        <p>The President and the Minister of State have asked me to convey to the
                            Department and to the Bank their deep appreciation and that of the Cuban
                            Government and people for the sympathetic and understanding
                            consideration which they have given to the needs of Cuba. The Prime
                            Minister and other Ministers of the Cuban Government have spoken to me
                            in the same sense. The reaction of the press, which will be more
                            apparent in editorial comment in a few days, is already such as to show
                            that this action on the part of our Government in extending this credit
                            is deeply appreciated by this friendly people who feel themselves bound
                            to us by unseverable ties.</p>
                        <p>I believe that I should take this occasion to again bring to the
                            attention of the Department how helpful has been the attitude of the
                            Minister of State, Dr. Cortina, during the conversations which we have
                            had with the Cuban Government since the beginning of this year in the
                            matter of these credits. It was to a large extent due to his
                            indefatigable labors and complete understanding that it was possible to
                            bring about developments in the internal situation of Cuba which made

                        <p>I shall not fail to keep the Department promptly informed of further

                            1914 of April 20, 1941 transmitting a copy of the Cuban Government’s
                            memorandum of April 15 with regard to Export-Import Bank credits for
                            agricultural diversification and development and for public works.</p>
                        <p>The Department is pleased with the tenor of the Cuban note and with the
                            numerous steps which the Cuban Government has taken in the line of
                            administrative and other reforms.</p>
                        <p>With regard to items 5, 8, 10 and 11 of the Cuban note, it is
                            particularly gratifying to receive the assurances of the Cuban
                            Government that it is its criterion “to liquidate such obligations as
                            have been properly clarified and fixed by the courts” and that “at any
                            time that a concrete and just claim …<note n="76" xml:id="d146fn76"
                                >Omission indicated in the original.</note> is presented to the
                            Government of Cuba by an American citizen, (that) Government will <pb
                                n="166" xml:id="pg_166" facs="0174"/>give it immediate
                            consideration”. The Department furthermore appreciates the arguments
                            advanced by the Cuban Government against the establishment of a special
                            commission to examine claims. The Department, however, is unable to
                            reconcile with the facts in its possession the statement in item 8 that
                            the Cuban Government has “no information with regard to any appreciable
                            or important claim made upon the Government of Cuba by any American
                            citizen, that has not been settled, with the exception of the Morris
                            claim”. In this connection, reference is made to the three lists of
                            claims of American nationals against the Cuban Government which were
                            enclosed with instruction no. 401 of December 30, 1940.<note n="77"
                                xml:id="d146fn77">Not printed.</note> Claims in the first list,
                            “which have been acknowledged by the Cuban authorities”, total
                            $458,557.81, not including the Morris claim nor that of J. Livingston
                            and Company (no. 16) which, it is understood, has recently been settled.
                            (No. 7 on list 2, the Drix Duryea, Incorporated, claim, may also now be
                            removed.) Furthermore, on list 3 there appears the claim of $798,000 in
                            which the United States Treasury has a three-fourths interest.</p>
                        <p>You are requested to discuss these points with Dr. Cortina at an
                            opportune moment for the purpose of indicating to the Foreign Minister
                            our satisfaction with the many cooperative measures which the Cuban
                            Government has taken and to reiterate our expectation that the Cuban
                            Government will give consideration to satisfactory settlements of
                            legitimate claims of American nationals.</p>
                        <p>In the meantime, while the Department does not desire to place
                            unnecessary additional burdens upon your staff, it desires to receive
                            your comments on instruction no. 401, to which it appears no reply has
                            yet been received.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of the Department’s instruction No. 642, May 10, 1941, in which
                            reference is made to my despatch No. 1914, of April 20, 1941, and to its
                            enclosure, a copy of the Cuban Government’s memorandum of April 15 with
                            regard to Export-Import Bank credits for agricultural diversification
                                <pb n="167" xml:id="pg_167" facs="0175"/>and development and for
                            public works. The Department refers in particular to the statement in
                            Item 8 of the Cuban Government’s memorandum to the effect that the Cuban
                            Government has “no information in regard to any appreciable or important
                            claim made upon the Government of Cuba by any American citizen, that has
                            not been settled, with the exception of the Morris claim.” The
                            Department, in this connection, requests the Embassy’s comments on its
                            instruction No. 401, of December 30, 1940,<note n="78" xml:id="d147fn78"
                                >Not printed.</note> transmitting three lists of claims of American
                            nationals against Cuba.</p>
                        <p>I have given instruction No. 401 considerable thought, and submit the
                            following recommendations concerning the three lists of claims of
                            American nationals against the Cuban Government transmitted with that
                            instruction:</p>
                        <p>(1) I consider that the Morris claim, which involves a judgment of the
                            Cuban Supreme Court, which has been actively pressed by the Embassy
                            during the last several years, and the payment of which has been
                            discussed with the Cuban Government in connection with possible
                            financial assistance by the United States, should continue to be
                            pressed, and that the financial assistance which the Export-Import Bank
                            is prepared to extend to Cuba should be predicated on an arrangement
                            concerning this claim satisfactory to both parties. Such arrangement
                            need not, however, contemplate immediate payment in full.</p>
                        <p>(2) I do not believe that the Government of the United States should, in
                            general, act as a collection agency or otherwise become involved in the
                            collection of current accounts against the Cuban Government by public
                            service corporations or by other suppliers of commodities. Such public
                            service companies and other suppliers customarily have their own methods
                            of settling their differences with the Cuban Government, and I believe
                            that the responsibility for maintaining their current business with the
                            Government on a satisfactory basis should be left entirely to the
                            officials of those companies. This is without prejudice to the possible
                            desirability of the Embassy’s giving such informal assistance to these
                            persons or interests as may appear to be advisable in particular
                            circumstances.</p>
                        <p>(3) I do not believe that the United States Government should revive any
                            claim which is not at present being actively pressed by the claimants
                            and make the payment of that claim a condition precedent to the granting
                            of financial assistance to the Government of Cuba. The financial
                            situation of the Cuban Government is not good. I believe that the
                            Government is making an honest effort to improve that situation, and the
                            financial help that we are able to give Cuba will be <pb n="168"
                                xml:id="pg_168" facs="0176"/>of material aid in this connection. It
                            is as much in the general interest of the United States as it is in the
                            interest of Cuba that such financial help should be given, and it is not
                            in the general interest of the United States that the granting of such
                            general help should be predicated on the Cuban Government’s action in
                            the case of a particular claim which might or might not turn out to be
                            meritorious. I am not excluding in this connection claims in connection
                            with which the claimant may have been able to get certificates or other
                            evidence from the Cuban Government acknowledging the particular debt
                            involved.</p>
                        <p>I particularly recommend that the Department take no action in connection
                            with the claim of the United States Treasury Department in the amount of
                            $798,055.27. This claim, it will be recalled, represents two judgments
                            rendered by the Cuban Supreme Court in favor of the Cuba Cane Sugar
                            Corporation which were assigned in part to the United States Treasury
                            Department, to be applied against income taxes owed by the Cuba Cane
                            Sugar Corporation to the United States Government.</p>
                        <p>It will be recalled in this connection that the Department of State was
                            opposed to the Treasury Department’s accepting this claim in lieu of
                            income taxes owed to the United States Government. It is not believed
                            that the Cuban Government gave its consent to the procedure, and the
                            Embassy perceives no moral basis on which it could approach the Cuban
                            Government with the request that the judgments in favor of the Cuba Cane
                            Sugar Corporation be paid to the Treasury of the United States. For the
                            Department to try to collect this debt, incurred by the United States
                            Treasury Department gratuitously and without the consent of the Cuban
                            Government, would tend seriously to prejudice our moral position in
                            Cuba.</p>
                        <p>(4) I recommend that under no circumstance should any claim included in
                            List 3 be brought to the Cuban Government’s attention at this time or in
                            any way connected with the proposed financing by the Export-Import Bank.
                            Many of these alleged claims should have a statute of limitation applied
                            to them. Others obviously are in the category of claims which the
                            Department formerly did not hesitate to sponsor, but which it would not
                            agree to sponsor today.</p>
                        <p>If the Department approves the foregoing, which I consider eminently
                            reasonable and just, the Embassy will not be under the necessity of
                            raising with the Cuban Government, in connection with the proposed
                            financing by the Export-Import Bank, any claim other than the Morris
                            Claim.</p>
                        <p>Unless I receive instructions to the contrary, I shall act on the
                            foregoing basis. I shall, of course, at an appropriate opportunity in
                            the near future, in accord with the last paragraph on page two of the
                            Department’s instruction, inform the Minister of State of our <pb
                                n="169" xml:id="pg_169" facs="0177"/>satisfaction with the many
                            cooperative measures which the Cuban Government has taken, and reiterate
                            our expectation that the Cuban Government will give consideration to the
                            satisfactory settlement of the legitimate claims of American
                            nationals.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador Messersmith called from Habana to inquire what progress was
                            being made in furnishing technicians to make the preliminary
                            arrangements for carrying out the $25,000,000 credit program. I replied
                            that Mr. Warren Pierson<note n="79a" xml:id="d149fn79a">President of the
                                Export-Import Bank.</note> had just returned from Brazil, that he
                            was prepared to send a lawyer to Cuba in the very near future to work on
                            the contract, that he advised that the Cuban Government prepare a draft
                            of a very simple law and submit it to this Government for its comments,
                            and that he would like to bring his lawyer to Habana on the occasion of
                            his own visit for the signing of the sugar financing arrangement. In
                            addition, Mr. Pierson and Mr. Wheeler of the Department of Agriculture
                            were completing arrangements to send one or two agricultural experts
                            with the Agriculture Department’s report. (I informed the Ambassador
                            that this report was being mimeographed and that copies would be made
                            available to him within a very few days.) With respect to a public works
                            expert, I informed the Ambassador that Mr. West, the engineer of the
                            Bank, would return next week from Brazil and that a few days later he
                            could go to Habana to begin the work. The Bank will find it necessary to
                            employ additional engineers to supervise the entire project.</p>
                        <pb n="170" xml:id="pg_170" facs="0178"/>
                        <p>The Ambassador indicated that he hoped that the Export-Import Bank would
                            not be difficult on the remaining terms of the sugar financing
                            agreement. I informed the Ambassador that all of the Bank’s comments
                            were in the hands of Dr. Mañas in Habana and that I believed there was
                            no reason why the Cubans could not complete the matter at once. The
                            Ambassador stated that the Cubans were questioning a provision whereby
                            the Export-Import Bank could place Cuban obligations which it acquires
                            with other institutions. I stated that this was a usual provision in all
                            contracts and the Ambassador replied that the Cubans admitted that the
                            Bank had the right but did not feel that it should appear in the
                            contract.</p>

                                xml:id="d150fn80">Not printed.</note> stating that the Cuban
                            Government desires to include in the legislation authorizing the
                            $25,000,000 Export-Import Bank credit an authorization to contract a
                            further credit of $5,000,000 for the establishment of Cuban banking
                            facilities.</p>
                        <p>It would appear to the Department that for the Cuban Government to
                            include in the law covering agricultural and public works credit a
                            provision to permit the Government to contract as well for an additional
                            loan to fulfill a banking project might constitute a repetition of the
                            serious mistake of September 1940 in passing the so-called $50,000,000
                            loan law without previous consultation with this Government. It is to be
                            feared that the inclusion of the proposed banking provisions may lead to
                            the undesired conclusion by Cuban public opinion that details of the
                            bank have been worked out and that this Government is committed for the
                            $5,000,000 specified for the bank (when such commitment has not yet been
                            made as to either amount or purpose).</p>
                        <p>It would accordingly be, in the Department’s opinion, prudent to remind
                            the Cuban authorities to whom you have mentioned the Federal Loan
                            Agency’s attitude toward the bank project that you did so confidentially
                            and in the frank spirit which has characterized your relations with
                            them, and that to publicize the matter at this time may jeopardize the
                            project’s success. You may repeat that this Government continues ready
                            to lend the necessary experts to assist in formulating a definite
                            banking project and the corresponding basic legislation, <pb n="171"

                            make for the bank credit.</p>

                            despatch no. 2027 of May 15, 1941, containing your recommendations with
                            reference to claims, other than the Morris claim, of American nationals
                            against the Cuban Government.</p>
                        <p>The Department was gratified to confirm on the occasion of your recent
                            visit to the United States that you shared its view of the
                            unsatisfactory nature of statements in item 8 of the Cuban memorandum of
                            April 15, 1941, relating to claims. The Department agrees with you that
                            settlement of outstanding claims other than the Morris claim need not
                            stand in the way of action on other parts of the program of cooperation.
                            However, you should make it of record with the Cuban Government that the
                            Department is not able to reconcile with the facts in its possession the
                            statement in item 8 that the Cuban Government has “no information with
                            regard to any appreciable or important claim made upon the Government of
                            Cuba by any American citizen, that has not been settled, with the
                            exception of the Morris claim”.</p>
                        <p>As an example of a claim which appears to deserve consideration without
                            delay, mention is made of the case of the H. C. Nutting Company of
                            Cincinnati, Ohio, which holds certificates of indebtedness of the Cuban
                            Government. A study of this case is being conducted preparatory to
                            determining what action on the part of the Department may now be
                            indicated.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to my despatch
                            No. 2030 of May 17, 1941,<note n="81" xml:id="d153fn81">Not
                                printed.</note> referring to previous correspondence with respect to
                            the desire expressed by the Municipality of Habana for a credit from the
                            Export-Import Bank for the purpose of carrying through the
                            rehabilitation of the Habana waterworks. It will be recalled that when I
                            was in Washington during the latter part of April, the Export-Import
                            Bank informed me that I could state to the Mayor of Habana that if the
                            Municipality transmitted a formal request to the Bank for the
                            consideration of a credit for the rehabilitation of the Habana
                            waterworks, the Bank would be disposed to consider this matter
                            sympathetically. There was transmitted with my despatch No. 2030 the
                            formal request of the Municipality of Habana for the consideration of
                            such a credit by the Export-Import Bank, the Mayor of the City having
                            been authorized by the City Council to make such a formal request. No
                            reply to this request from the Municipality of Habana has yet been
                            received so far as I know—unless a formal acknowledgment of the Mayor’s
                            letter may have been sent directly to him.</p>
                        <p>During the visit of Mr. Warren Pierson, the President of the
                            Export-Import Bank, to Habana last week for the purpose of signing the
                            contract in the sugar loan, and for the purpose of discussing with the
                            Cuban Government certain major matters connected with the credit of
                            $25,000,000 extended to the Cuban Government for the carrying through of
                            public works and agricultural diversification projects, I thought it
                            would be desirable for Mr. Pierson to see Mayor Menocal, as the Mayor
                            had expressed to me a very strong desire that he have an opportunity to
                            see Mr. Pierson during his stay. I therefore arranged <pb n="173"
                                xml:id="pg_173" facs="0181"/>for a conversation between Mr. Pierson
                            and Mayor Menocal on Friday, June 13.</p>
                        <p>Prior to seeing the Mayor, Mr. Pierson and I had had an opportunity to
                            discuss briefly the Bank’s attitude in this matter. I gathered from what
                            Mr. Pierson said that, while the Bank had over a period of years given
                            some consideration to the Habana waterworks project and considered it
                            one of the most effective and sound projects which could be carried
                            through in Cuba, and while the Bank had always considered the project
                            with sympathy, he believed that the present was, in some respects, not
                            an opportune time for carrying through this project. It involved a
                            considerable amount of material which it would be increasingly difficult
                            to get from the United States because of the demands of the defense
                            program upon our industry. The Bank, too, had limited personnel and it
                            had been giving a great deal of time in recent months to Cuban matters,
                            particularly the sugar arrangement and the $25,000,000 credit for public
                            works and agricultural diversification projects. He was hoping,
                            therefore, that action on the waterworks project might be somewhat
                            delayed.</p>
                        <p>With this background in mind, Mr. Pierson and I met Mayor Menocal on June
                            13. The Mayor emphasized the desirability of the project and of as rapid
                            action as possible in carrying it through. He said that there was great
                            expectancy on the part of the Habana population which had appreciated
                            tremendously the indication given by the Bank that it would be prepared
                            to receive a formal application from the Municipality. He was daily
                            approached by many responsible people who did not understand all that
                            was involved and who were reproaching him because work had not actually
                            been started.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Pierson informed the Mayor that the Bank had in the past and still
                            viewed this project with sympathy and favor. He felt that the present
                            moment was in many ways inopportune for the beginning of the project as
                            there would be extraordinary difficulties in getting the necessary
                            machinery and materials for the carrying through of the project and of
                            which the United States was the only source. He called attention to the
                            fact that the project was one which required considerable further study
                            and that this would take time. He emphasized the manner in which the
                            Bank was overburdened with the many things which were before it.</p>
                        <p>The Mayor said that these very factors he had in mind and he understood
                            them but that, in his opinion, the question of materials should not be
                            so great an impediment. There was preliminary work to be done and at the
                            outset of the actual work on the project a relatively small amount of
                            material would be needed. The project was one which would take some
                            years to carry through, and even if work were started today it would be
                            a year before certain types of material would <pb n="174"
                                xml:id="pg_174" facs="0182"/>be required. He thought there was much
                            reason to believe that by the time certain materials were needed the
                            situation in the United States would have sufficiently improved in the
                            way of industrial supplies to make it feasible for the necessary
                            materials to be secured.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the great volume of the work the Bank had to handle, he
                            quite understood this situation and for that reason particularly
                            appreciated the attention which the Bank had and was giving this
                            matter.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the preliminary work to be done, the Mayor stated that
                            this was just what preoccupied him the most. There had been various
                            studies made of the waterworks project but perhaps none of them could be
                            considered complete. Several years ago, the City of Habana had had a
                            study made of a preliminary character, but it could not be considered
                            complete. This study was its own property and the engineers who had
                            prepared it had no financial interest therein. The Mayor also called
                            attention to a more recent and more complete study which had been made
                            by a group of Cuban engineers on their own initiative. So far as he
                            could judge and knew, this was the best study which had been made. He
                            understood also that there were studies which had been made by some
                            American firms, but how complete they were he was unable to say. He was
                            of the opinion that some action should be taken to get a study which
                            would give an adequate basis for the Bank to make its decisions. He was
                            extremely anxious that something in this direction should be done.</p>
                        <p>I took the liberty of suggesting that the best procedure might be for the
                            Mayor to submit to the Bank this preliminary study to which he had
                            referred as being the property of the City. Although it was not
                            complete, it would give the Bank something concrete on which to work. If
                            he submitted such a study to the Bank, the Bank would be able to give it
                            its consideration and make its observations to the City. Thereafter, on
                            the basis of the observations which the Bank might make on this
                            preliminary study, and on the basis of further observations which the
                            City might make, it might be found desirable for the City to have an
                            independent study made on its behalf and for its account by competent
                            engineers. I emphasized that, in my opinion, such a further study, if
                            made, should be made independently of any contracting firms in the
                            United States or in Cuba. The Mayor agreed that this procedure seemed to
                            be the only one to follow at this time and he said that he would forward
                            to the Bank in the very near future the preliminary study of the project
                            which was the property of the City and in transmitting it he would make
                            any further observations which he considered useful.</p>
                        <p>The discussion then turned to the pressures which were being brought on
                            the Municipality here and on the Export-Import Bank <pb n="175"
                                xml:id="pg_175" facs="0183"/>at home by American and Cuban firms and
                            individuals interested in the contract for the project. Mr. Pierson said
                            that the Bank was constantly being importuned by American firms
                            interested in the contract and had also been approached by Cuban firms.
                            Mayor Menocal said that the pressure on him here was enormous by both
                            American and Cuban firms. It was brought out that there are Cuban and
                            American firms which are endeavoring to give the impression both in
                            Habana and in Washington that they have an “inside track” and that
                            certain formal and informal commitments have been made to them. Mr.
                            Pierson said that he wished Mayor Menocal to know that the Bank had made
                            no commitment whatever to any contracting firm. Mayor Menocal assured
                            Mr. Pierson that, irrespective of what might be said, he had made no
                            such commitment to any firm—American or Cuban.</p>
                        <p>I took this opportunity to say that, in my opinion, it was obviously
                            undesirable to make any such commitment to any Cuban firm or to any
                            American firm. I said that whatever further studies were undertaken
                            should be undertaken in such a way that they involved not the slightest
                            obligation to any contracting firm whether Cuban or American. The Bank
                            and the Mayor of Habana had both expressed the absolute necessity of the
                            project being carried through in the most effective manner and in a way
                            which assured that every cent went into actual construction. Some of
                            those interested in securing the contract were obviously more interested
                            in what they could make out of it than in seeing the best job done. The
                            Mayor took this occasion to emphasize again that, while he wanted this
                            project to be carried through while he was Mayor of Habana, he had made
                            it abundantly clear that it would have to be carried through in an
                            entirely honest and effective manner. I may say in this connection that
                            I believe the Mayor is sincere in his expressions.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Pierson raised the point that there was some scepticism as to whether
                            it would be possible to carry through this project in such a sound
                            manner in view of the attitude which the City Council might take. The
                            Mayor in this connection said that the need for the Habana waterworks
                            renovation was so great that the City Council could not stand in the way
                            of any arrangement for carrying out the project which meant complete
                            honesty. Pressure of public opinion was so great that in this particular
                            matter any sound arrangement which the Bank might desire could be
                            carried through. I ventured the opinion in this connection that I
                            believed that the City Council would have to take all appropriate
                            measures to carry through the project in a sound manner as it could not
                            oppose itself to public opinion which would support even the most severe
                            measures which the Bank might feel necessary to impose for the proper
                            carrying through of <pb n="176" xml:id="pg_176" facs="0184"/>the project
                            and for the future administration of the waterworks in order to assure
                            amortization and interest of the debt involved.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Pierson raised the question as to whether it would not be desirable
                            to consolidate the Marianao waterworks with the Habana waterworks in
                            connection with the carrying through of this project. The Mayor did not
                            feel that this would be feasible. I am not sure whether his
                            considerations were mainly political or not, but so far as I have given
                            this matter study, I do not believe that the amalgamation of the two,
                            which is desirable, is impossible. The American waterworks which are the
                            owners of the Marianao plant have shown a disposition to sell, and I
                            believe it is largely a question as to how reasonable this company would
                            be in disposing of its interests.</p>
                        <p>The Mayor made a very strong plea for early consideration of this matter
                            by the Bank and showed obvious disappointment that the matter was not
                            developing more rapidly. He said that he would in the very near future
                            send to the Bank the preliminary study referred to in this despatch,
                            with further observations of the City, and would await with the keenest

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform the Department
                            that Mr. Warren Pierson, President of the Export-Import Bank, arrived in
                            Habana on Thursday, June 12th, towards midday. The majority of the
                            members of the Executive Committee of the Sugar Stabilization Institute
                            were at the airport to meet him.</p>
                        <p>It had been planned that the contract for the Export-Import Bank loan, to
                            make possible the production of an extra quota of 400,000 long tons of
                            sugar, was to be signed by President Batista and Mr. Pierson at noon,
                            June 12th, at the Palace. President Batista was confined to his bed on
                            account of a sudden illness, and was unable to sign that day, hence the
                            ceremony was postponed until June 13th at the same hour. In a separate
                                despatch<note n="82" xml:id="d154fn82">No separate despatch found in
                                Department files; however, there is a letter dated June 14, 1941,
                                from the Ambassador to Under Secretary Welles commenting on the
                                signing of the contract (837.51 Cooperation Program/119).</note> the
                            Embassy has reported that the sugar loan <pb n="177" xml:id="pg_177"
                                facs="0185"/>contract was signed on June 13th, 1941, at 12 o’clock
                            by Mr. Pierson, by President Batista and other appropriate officials of
                            the Cuban government.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Pierson was accompanied by Mr. Mersereau, of the Bank; Mr. West, a
                            Public Works expert of the Bank, and Mr. Laguardia, of the Department of
                            Agriculture, had arrived the day before. During the afternoon of June
                            12th, Mr. Pierson and I were able to go into a number of matters
                            connected with the $25,000,000 credit and later to go over these with
                            the experts who accompanied him.</p>
                        <p>In order to arrange for the first contact between the Cabinet Committee
                            of the Cuban government and Mr. Pierson and his associates, I invited
                            them to dinner at the Embassy. After dinner there was the opportunity
                            for at least three hours discussion on some of the basic questions which
                            had to be considered in connection with the $25,000,000 credit. There
                            were present for the Cuban government the complete Cabinet Committee
                            composed of the Prime Minister, Dr. Saladrigas; the Minister of State,
                            Dr. Cortina; the Minister of the Presidency, Dr. López Castro; the
                            Minister of the Treasury, Dr. Morales del Castillo, and Dr. Oscar García
                            Montes. There was present as interpreter of the Cuban Committee Mr.
                            Arango, the son-in-law of the Minister of State. For us there
                            participated Messrs. Pierson, West, Mersereau and Laguardia. Mr. Nufer,
                            the Commercial Attaché, and Mr. O’Donoghue, of the Embassy, were
                            present.</p>
                        <p>I opened the conversation by saying that I thought this meeting was an
                            ideal opportunity to bring the Cuban officials in direct contact with
                            Mr. Pierson and his associates for an informal and exploratory
                            [ex]change of views on various major factors connected with the
                            $25,000,000 credit for public works and agricultural diversification. I
                            asked Mr. Pierson to open the discussion.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Pierson stated that so far as the Bank was concerned the credit had
                            been authorized and now it was the Bank’s desire that the machinery be
                            set up for as rapid utilization of the credit as may be feasible and
                            possible. He said that the Bank wished to see this money expended in
                            work which would redound to the benefit of Cuba, of the Cuban people and
                            to the Bank’s interest. He said that the Bank was not interested in
                            providing money for the support of the Cuban government, nor for
                            political purposes and ends, but rather the Bank desired that such
                            arrangements be made so that every penny of the credit went into actual
                            work. The Bank was not interested in creating new jobs in the Cuban
                            government but in getting constructive projects carried through in a
                            sound and clean way.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Pierson went on to say that the Bank was not interested in seeing
                            money spent in maintaining old projects but rather desired to see the
                            money spent on new works. Merely as a suggestion, and not as an <pb
                                n="178" xml:id="pg_178" facs="0186"/>idea to which he was completely
                            wedded, it was his opinion that it would greatly simplify matters if a
                            Corporation were set up by the Cuban government, or a well defined
                            committee composed of appropriate members of the Cuban government
                            (indicating that those present would be very acceptable). This committee
                            would have sole and responsible charge of the selection of the projects
                            and of carrying them through for the Cuban government. This would
                            facilitate the work of the Bank and of the Cuban government. It would be
                            quite impossible, Mr. Pierson said, to endeavor to carry through these
                            projects by individual departments of the Cuban government—this would
                            result in confusion and lack of efficiency.</p>
                        <p>This committee could very well be aided by a sort of General Manager, as
                            it was obvious that the members of the Cabinet Committee or corporation
                            would not have the time to devote themselves fully to this work. Such an
                            executive was needed. He could be an American or a Cuban. There should
                            also be a controller, and in this position an American could serve very
                            well, but he had no set views on this subject. Mr. Pierson strongly
                            brought out the necessity for a businesslike and well set up and
                            organized body to carry through these projects. He emphasized that the
                            corporation or committee should have charge not only of the selection of
                            the projects but of carrying them through from beginning to end.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Pierson stated that the recommendations made by the corporation or
                            committee for projects should be, of course, submitted to the Bank for
                            its approval and he could assure them that the Bank would not be long in
                            giving its opinion. It was a desire of the Bank to facilitate the
                            carrying through of the projects.</p>
                        <p>At first Dr. Cortina and Mr. López Castro appeared to be opposed to the
                            idea of a corporation or a committee to be charged with the work and the
                            selection of the projects. Mr. López Castro particularly did not seem to
                            take to the idea and I could readily see that he did not understand what
                            Mr. Pierson had in mind. I explained, therefore, very fully what Mr.
                            Pierson had in mind, and that it would be quite impossible, from our
                            point of view, to select these projects in the public interest and to
                            carry them through in a sound and effective way as the individual
                            Ministries under which they ordinarily fell had no direct
                            responsibility. I said that what Mr. Pierson had in mind was that there
                            must be a corporation or committee especially set up for this purpose
                            and with sole control. It, of course, would call upon the existing
                            organisms of the Cuban government for help in the work, but they would
                            be acting for and under the corporation or committee. When Dr. Cortina
                            and Mr. López Castro more thoroughly understood Mr. Pierson’s
                            suggestion, they warmed up to it and towards the end of the meeting on
                            several occasions expressed the opinion that Mr. <pb n="179"
                                xml:id="pg_179" facs="0187"/>Pierson’s suggestion should prove a
                            practical one, greatly facilitate the work and eliminate a good deal of
                            detail.</p>
                        <p>There was then some general discussion with respect to the authorization
                            act for the credit. Dr. Cortina said that the Prime Minister and Mr.
                            García Montes had been giving this attention. It was their thought that
                            the law should be sufficiently general but at the same time should
                            contain sufficiently specific provisions to give power to control the
                            work so that it would be properly carried through. Dr. Cortina went on
                            to say that President Batista had only a few more years to serve as
                            President. Under the constitution, which President Batista himself
                            helped to establish, an interval of eight years would have to pass
                            before he could serve as president again. He emphasized that President
                            Batista had as his principal ambition the desire to do something useful
                            for his country and to secure prestige for himself during his term of
                            office. The President, therefore, was interested in the rapid, sound,
                            clean and efficient carrying through of the projects under this
                            credit.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Cortina said that he believed the Cuban government would be prepared
                            to carry through the suggestion for a corporation or committee made by
                            Mr. Pierson. He was sure we would find that the Cuban government would
                            be prepared to accept any suggestions which will provide for a proper
                            selection and execution of the projects. He emphasized again that the
                            Cuban government is as much interested as is the Bank that these works
                            be carried through in a clean and constructive manner.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Cortina said that he was not sure whether it would be advisable to
                            put the provision for the corporation or committee in the authorization
                            act or not. It might make difficulty in getting the bill through
                            Congress if this provision is in the act. He said, however, if the
                            provision for the corporation or committee was not in the authorization
                            act, there would have to be a well defined confidential agreement
                            between the President and the Cuban government and the Bank that the
                            President would by decree set up the corporation or the committee. Mr.
                            Pierson and I said that it seemed immaterial, so far as our government
                            was concerned, as to whether the committee or corporation was set up in
                            the authorization act or by decree. This was a matter to be decided more
                            by the Cuban government than by us.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the projects to be selected, there was agreement that
                            there should be no announcement of any decision with respect to projects
                            until after the authorization act is approved. It was agreed that this
                            was desirable in order to prevent jockeying in the Congress for votes.
                            Mr. Pierson and I both emphasized the importance of the authorizing act
                            being approved quickly, as it was not possible to do anything concrete
                            until this act was passed and the contract signed. <pb n="180"
                                xml:id="pg_180" facs="0188"/>In other words, there could be no real
                            progress until the law was passed and the contract signed. In this
                            connection, Mr. Pierson emphasized that naturally, in view of the
                            defense program, there would be certain difficulties in securing
                            necessary materials for the carrying through of some of the projects.
                            The sooner the law was passed and the contract signed, the sooner would
                            they be able to determine projects to be realized and to establish what
                            materials would be necessary.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Pierson said that in certain cases it might be possible to secure
                            priorities for materials. He could make no commitments in this respect
                            but the Bank would be willing to do what it could in order to get
                            necessary materials. Mr. Pierson further made the useful and concrete
                            suggestion that the projects first approved could very properly be such
                            which would not require too much material or material which could be
                            more readily obtained. Mr. López Castro said they had this very much in
                            mind and were making their plans accordingly.</p>
                        <p>Various members of the Cuban Committee expressed themselves on the
                            necessity of the projects being carried through in a clean and sound
                            manner. They said they realized that if they carried through these
                            projects in an entirely acceptable manner there was a chance of further
                            needs of Cuba being considered. Mr. Pierson said he could make no
                            commitments with regard to further credits, but that he knew of nothing
                            which would create a more favorable atmosphere for further credits than
                            an altogether sound realization of the projects under the present
                            credit.</p>
                        <p>The conversation then turned again to the general lines which would be
                            followed in the selection of projects. Mr. García Montes, a former
                            Minister of the Treasury and, who, together with Mr. López Castro, has
                            been studying projects said he thought Mr. Pierson’s observations
                            respecting new and old public works required further clarification. At
                            this point Mr. López Castro took exception also to Mr. Pierson’s remarks
                            respecting new and old works. He said there could be no general rules
                            laid down which could be followed explicitly. He said in general he
                            agreed that the projects should be new projects but that there were
                            certain projects which would have to be considered and which were really
                            old projects. In his opinion one of the principal projects would be the
                            repair and actual reconstruction of certain sections of the central
                            highway.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows discussion regarding the need for repairs on the central
                            highway.]</p>
                        <p>Mr. Pierson said that his remarks with regard to old and new works had
                            been made for the purpose of stressing an important principle rather
                            than for the purpose of opposing the idea of repairs for the central
                            highway. He realized as things were that the central highway would
                            probably have to be repaired from funds out of the $25,000,000 <pb
                                n="181" xml:id="pg_181" facs="0189"/>credit. Mr. Pierson said that
                            he recognized not only the economic but the strategic and defense
                            importance of the central highway.</p>
                        <p>Mr. West and Mr. Laguardia expressed the view that in spite of the
                            considerations given by Mr. Pierson they were of the opinion that under
                            the actual circumstances which had to control, it would be necessary to
                            make the appropriate repairs to the central highway out of this credit.
                            The central highway was the backbone of the transportation system of
                            Cuba and unless it was in altogether good condition almost any help that
                            could be done under the credit would not be fully realized.</p>
                        <p>The Minister of State remarked that, being a very systematic and orderly
                            person, he wished to restate what in general he thought was a résumé of
                            the conversation. He said it was his understanding it was the opinion of
                            all present that the projects must be such as to redound to the benefit
                            of Cuba and its people; that the works must be carried through in an
                            orderly, sound and honest way; that it is not controlling in the
                            selection of works as to whether they are old or new projects, the
                            completion of those under way or the maintenance of old ones, provided
                            they tend to improve the general economic situation. So far as the
                            creation of a central committee or corporation for selecting the
                            projects and carrying them through is concerned, he felt that this was a
                            matter which they naturally must take up with the President, but in his
                            opinion, which he repeated several times, there should be no difficulty
                            on this point.</p>
                        <p>The meeting terminated, I believe, with the general feeling on both sides
                            that it had been a helpful one. There is no doubt that Mr. Pierson had
                            been able to get across to the Cuban officials his two main ideas
                            respecting the creation of a central committee or corporation and that
                            in the future there be provision for maintenance out of current funds
                            rather than depending upon loans for maintenance. The Prime Minister
                            stated at the end of the meeting that the Cabinet Committee would meet
                            with the President the following day and would like to meet with Mr.
                            Pierson and me afterwards.</p>
                        <p>The Cabinet Committee had a meeting with the President on Friday, June
                            13th, after the signing of the sugar contract, during which meeting they
                            went over the whole situation with the President, taking up the points
                            raised in the conversation the evening before. Mr. Pierson and I met the
                            full Cabinet Committee at Dr. Cortina’s house in the late afternoon on
                            Friday, June 13th, for a conference of several hours. Dr. Cortina
                            explained that the various points raised the evening before had been
                            discussed with the President and that the President was quite in accord
                            with the ideas on which general agreement had been reached. The
                            President had expressed his willingness that a corporation or committee
                            should be set up which would have sole authority in selecting <pb
                                n="182" xml:id="pg_182" facs="0190"/>and carrying through the works,
                            rather than having this responsibility in the different Ministries. The
                            President was also in accord with the idea of a General Manager. The
                            President had reiterated his desire that the work should be carried
                            through in a sound, honest and constructive manner. He wished during his
                            term of office to do something constructive and lasting for Cuba and did
                            not conceal that his sole personal interest in the matter was the
                            prestige which would accrue to him through the proper carrying through
                            of the work.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Pierson raised the question of a controller and stated that so far as
                            the Bank was concerned he did not believe it was material whether he was
                            a Cuban or an American citizen. The important thing was that there
                            should be a competent General Manager and Controller to serve as the
                            executives of the corporation or cabinet committee. Mr. Pierson
                            reiterated his opinion that it was for the Cuban government to decide
                            whether the corporation or committee should be set up in the authorizing
                            act or by presidential decree.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Pierson further said that, of course, the Bank would need to have
                            certain people here in Cuba acting for it and that vouchers for payment
                            for work as completed would have to be approved by the representatives
                            of the Bank. The Cabinet Committee did not offer any objections to this
                            procedure, but it indicated it felt that the Bank’s representatives here
                            should be persons with adequate authority. Mr. Pierson assented to
                            this.</p>
                        <p>There was further discussion of the general types of projects and Mr.
                            Pierson again emphasized that the Bank’s one interest was that the
                            projects should be constructive and sound, and that when recommendations
                            reach the Bank for particular projects they would be quickly acted
                            upon.</p>
                        <p>The Cabinet Committee expressed appreciation of the action by the Bank in
                            having Messrs. Mersereau, West and Laguardia here, and who have stayed
                            after the departure of Mr. Pierson.</p>
                        <p>The Cabinet Committee agreed to facilitate the work in the preparation of
                            the draft of the authorizing act and of the contract. Mr. Pierson
                            emphasized that no definite step could be taken in actually doing work
                            until the authorizing act has been passed and the contract signed.</p>
                        <p>After the meeting with the Cabinet Committee on June 13th, Mr. Pierson
                            and I went over the conversations with Mr. Pierson’s associates so that
                            they had the full background.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Mersereau is working with Mr. García Montes on the draft of the
                            authorizing act and on the contract. Messrs. Laguardia and West are
                            working with Mr. López Castro and other members of the Cabinet Committee
                            on the preliminary examination of projects.</p>
                        <p>It is my opinion that the visit of Mr. Pierson to Habana has been most
                            useful. The signing of the sugar contract in the Palace gave <pb n="183"
                                xml:id="pg_183" facs="0191"/>this action of our government another
                            opportunity for helpful and constructive public and editorial comment.
                            The conversations which Mr. Pierson was able to have with the Cabinet
                            Committee during his stay did much to clarify the position. I had been
                            trying to build up over months a certain situation and the visit of Mr.
                            Pierson helped to accentuate what I had already said to the Cuban
                            government. The agreement of the Cuban government to the setting up of a
                            corporation or cabinet committee, which shall have sole control of the
                            selection and carrying through of the projects, is a great step forward.
                            It will facilitate not only the contact between the Bank and the Cuban
                            government, but it will provide the machinery for the honest and
                            effective carrying through of the projects. It was most important that
                            the projects should not be carried through by individual departments of
                            the Cuban government but through such a central organization. I am sure
                            the Cuban government appreciates very much the action which the Bank
                            took in making it possible for Mr. Pierson to come here, with his
                            associates, at this time.</p>
                        <p>I fear that under the best circumstances the progress which will be made
                            will not be as rapid as the Cuban government and the Cuban people
                            desire, but we have made it clear that whatever delays there will be
                            will not be any responsibility of the Bank or of our government. While I
                            believe the Cuban government has the desire to facilitate the passage of
                            the act and the signing of the contract, this is bound to be a somewhat
                            slow process, although there is, of course, the possibility that it may
                            be done quickly.</p>
                        <p>President Batista has indicated that he is prepared to call a special
                            session of Congress before the end of June or in early July—just as soon
                            as the authorizing bill is ready for presentation to the Congress. The
                            message to accompany the authorizing bill is already prepared.</p>
                        <p>I shall continue to keep the Department informed of developments.</p>
                        <p>Respectfully yours,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of the Department’s Instruction no. 711, of June 13, 1941, with
                            reference to my air mail despatch no. 2027, of May 15, 1941, containing
                            certain recommendations of this Embassy with reference to claims, other
                            than the Morris claim, which American nationals may have against the
                            Cuban government. I have noted carefully the Department’s
                            instruction.</p>
                        <pb n="184" xml:id="pg_184" facs="0192"/>
                        <p>I had already verbally made observations to the Minister of State, Dr.
                            Cortina, with regard to Paragraph Eight of the memorandum of the Cuban
                            government of April 15, 1941. In view of the Department’s instruction
                            under reference, I thought it desirable to take up this matter with him
                            in a more definite way and during the course of a conversation yesterday
                            with Dr. Cortina, I reverted to this matter and left with him an <hi
                                rend="italic">Aide-Mémoire</hi>,<note n="83" xml:id="d155fn83">Not
                                printed.</note> of which a copy is attached to this despatch.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Cortina said that in including Paragraph Eight in the memorandum of
                            April 15, 1941 he had not intended to state that there were no other
                            claims of American citizens against the Cuban government; he had meant
                            to state that there were no appreciable claims which were being pressed
                            by American citizens against the Cuban government other than the Morris
                            claim.</p>
                        <p>I told the Minister that while I did not intend to take up specifically
                            with him at this time other claims than the Morris claim, there were a
                            number of what appeared to be well substantiated claims against the
                            Cuban government by American citizens, which were of long standing and
                            which should have received satisfaction before this. Some of them were
                            in considerable amounts. I called his specific attention to the case of
                            the H. C. Nutting Company, of Cincinnati, Ohio, which is mentioned in
                            the Department’s instruction under reply, and said that I would
                            undoubtedly have to revert to this in the near future as the claim
                            appeared to be a well founded one.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Cortina assured me that established claims of American citizens
                            against the Cuban government would receive attention as rapidly as it
                            was possible for the Cuban government to give it. He spoke of the
                            tremendously difficult situation of the Cuban Treasury at this time and
                            of the fact that the government had just been obliged, much against its
                            will, to make a cut in the salaries of most of the government employees,
                            as well as in other expenditures of the government.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to previous
                            correspondence with respect to the credit for $25,000,000 extended by
                            the Export-Import <pb n="185" xml:id="pg_185" facs="0193"/>Bank to the
                            Cuban Government for agricultural diversification and public works
                            projects. It will be recalled that in my despatch No. 2196 of June 17,
                            1941, I reported fully on the conversations which took place between Mr.
                            Pierson of the Bank and his associates who accompanied him, and the
                            Cabinet Committee of the Cuban Government which is handling this matter.
                            Mr. Mersereau, an attorney of the Bank, remained in Habana after the
                            departure of Mr. Pierson in order to collaborate with officials of the
                            Cuban Government, at their request, in the preparation of a draft of the
                            authorizing act which must be voted by the Cuban Congress. Mr. Mersereau
                            worked principally with Dr. Oscar García Montes in the preparation of
                            the draft, but I understand that they were in more or less communication
                            with the Prime Minister, Dr. Saladrigas, and Mr. López Castro.</p>
                        <p>At about 10 o’clock in the evening on June 24, Mr. Mersereau called me on
                            the telephone to say that he had had a message over the telephone from
                            Dr. García Montes to the effect that President Batista had raised
                            certain objections with respect to the final draft.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>I had an appointment to see the Minister of State on June 25 which
                            appointment he could not keep as he was taken ill. I saw him yesterday
                            afternoon and he took up with me the matter of the draft bill for the
                            credit. Dr. Cortina stated that he, Dr. Saladrigas, Mr. López Castro and
                            Dr. García Montes had made excellent progress in going over the draft
                            bill with the President on the afternoon and evening of June 24. The
                            President raised objection to the ten-year amortization period which is
                            provided for in the law on the following basis.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>Dr. Cortina said that he thought the attitude of the President was
                            justified and that in the conversations with him and the President I had
                            indicated that one-half of the loan would have to be paid in ten years
                            and the Bank would favorably consider an extension of the second half of
                            the loan if amortization and interest charges had in the meantime been
                            met promptly. I had spoken of this extension as for another ten years. I
                            reminded Dr. Cortina in this connection that he was correct in his
                            recollection of most of what I had said, but that I had not mentioned a
                            period of a further ten years. I had said that at the end of ten years
                            the Bank would be prepared to consider an extension of the second half
                            of the loan but I had not indicated any specific time, but that we had
                            generally spoken of a possibility of a period of ten years for the
                            second half.</p>
                        <p>I asked Dr. Cortina whether the President and the Committee had any major
                            objections to raise to the draft bill prepared by Mr. Mersereau and Dr.
                            García Montes in other respects. He said that <pb n="186"
                                xml:id="pg_186" facs="0194"/>they had no such objections to raise to
                            his knowledge. They considered that the draft bill on the whole was an
                            excellent piece of work. There were two principal points, Dr. Cortina
                            said, to be cleared up: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>1. Whether it was in the opinion of the Bank necessary that the
                                    taxes should be sufficient to cover the amortization and
                                    interest of the whole credit in ten years;</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">I told Dr. Cortina I would consult the Bank immediately
                            about this but that I could naturally not give him a responsible answer
                            now. It was my personal opinion, however, that the Bank had in no sense
                            insisted that the taxes cover the amortization and interest charges on
                            the $25,000,000 during the first ten years. Mr. Mersereau was familiar
                            with the letter dated May 2, 1941,<note n="84" xml:id="d156fn84">Not
                                printed.</note> which Mr. Jesse Jones, the Federal Loan
                            Administrator, had addressed to me. It was my understanding from Mr.
                            Mersereau that it was Dr. García Montes who had insisted in the drafting
                            of the law that the taxes provided should cover full amortization and
                            interest during the ten-year period, including the 52 percent instalment
                            at the end of ten years. Dr. García Montes had stated that this was
                            necessary under the Cuban Constitution even though the twentieth payment
                            would not have to be made in full at the end of ten years. I ventured
                            the personal opinion that so far as the Bank was concerned it would
                            consider the taxes provided in the authorizing act satisfactory if they
                            provided amply and liberally for covering the amortization and interest
                            payments for one-half of the loan during ten years and if the taxes
                            voted would be permanent in the sense that they would apply exclusively
                            to the amortization and interest of the loan until it was fully repaid
                            under any extensions which might be granted by the Bank.</p>
                        <p>I would very much appreciate a statement from the Bank as to what may be
                            said to the Cuban Government in this respect.</p>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>2. Dr. Cortina said that, at the request of the President, he wished
                                me to consult my Government as to whether I could address a Note to
                                the Cuban Government quoting the text of the letter of Mr. Jones to
                                me dated May 2, 1941, and stating that at the end of the ten-year
                                period our Government would recommend to the Bank, or its successor,
                                the extension of the second half of the loan as provided in the
                                letter of Mr. Jones.</p>
                        </quote>
                        <p rend="flushleft">Dr. Cortina said that the President was of the opinion
                            that if such a Note were addressed to the Cuban Government, it could be
                            kept in confidence and would not have to be given any publicity
                            whatever, but it would provide the protection which the President felt
                            he must have.</p>
                        <pb n="187" xml:id="pg_187" facs="0195"/>
                        <p>I told Dr. Cortina yesterday afternoon that I would consult my Government
                            and the Bank immediately with respect to the two points above mentioned.
                            I said that I believed it would be possible to get a favorable answer in
                            both respects. With regard to the question of the taxes, this was a
                            question, according to my understanding, which had been raised by Dr.
                            García Montes and not by Mr. Mersereau. I myself was of the opinion that
                            the taxes provided should liberally cover the repayment of the first
                            half of the loan in ten years and be voted in the law in such a way that
                            they would continue and be reserved for the payment of amortization and
                            interest for the second half during the period of extension which would
                            be granted.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the desire of the President that there should be a Note
                            from the Embassy, I quite understood his position on this point. I did
                            not see any reason why my Government should not authorize me to address
                            a confidential Note to the Minister of State quoting, or conveying, the
                            contents of the letter of Mr. Jones to me of May 2, 1941, and conveying
                            at the same time the assurance that my Government at the end of ten
                            years would support the request of the Cuban Government for an extension
                            of the second half of the loan provided interest and amortization
                            charges had been met.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Cortina said that he would take up this matter with the President and
                            get in touch with me. He communicated with me this morning to say that
                            he had had a long talk with the President this morning and he felt quite
                            confident that if we worked out these two points along the lines above
                            mentioned there could be agreement on the draft law very quickly. The
                            President was going out of town today for the week-end, and that he, the
                            Minister of State, Dr. Saladrigas, Mr. López Castro and Dr. García
                            Montes would have a meeting with the President on Monday, June 30, after
                            which he would communicate with me. In the meantime he would ask Dr.
                            García Montes to take the draft law and change it in the sense that the
                            taxes voted would only have to cover one-half of the loan during the
                            first ten years. The taxes voted, however, should be “amply liberal” to
                            provide for adequately meeting of all amortization and interest charges
                            on the first half of the loan during the first ten years. As soon as Dr.
                            García Montes had completed the draft in this sense he would see that
                            copies would be made available to our Government and to the Bank.</p>
                        <p>On my side, Dr. Cortina said that he would ask that I communicate
                            immediately with my Government to determine whether it will authorize me
                            to address a confidential Note to the Minister of State quoting or
                            giving the text of Mr. Jones’ letter, above referred to, and giving the
                            assurance of my Government that it would favorably <pb n="188"
                                xml:id="pg_188" facs="0196"/>support an extension of the second half
                            of the loan at the end of ten years.</p>

                        <p>As no action with respect to the credit may be undertaken until this
                            authorizing act is completed, and as the President is awaiting calling
                            the Congress into session, after the draft bill has been agreed upon, it
                            will be very much appreciated if action on this despatch can be
                            facilitated. …</p>

                        <p>168. Your despatch no. 2266 of June 27, 1941 and personal letters to the
                            Under Secretary, Bonsal and Pierson. The Department and the
                            Export-Import Bank do not believe that any confidential notes regarding
                            the period of amortization are desirable. The Department has
                            consequently recommended that the Export-Import Bank fix a definite
                            period, and the Executive Committee of the Export-Import Bank today
                            approved the acceptance of notes payable 15 years from the date of each
                            advance, to be amortized 5 percent annually for 10 years and 10 percent
                            annually for the succeeding 5 years. The Bank will endeavor to work out
                            a formula to provide for an average maturity date which will result in
                            giving Cuba a total of some 17 to 18 years from the inception of the
                            credit to liquidate it. The Export-Import Bank finds it impracticable to
                            extend a straight 20–year credit.</p>
                        <p>Please inform the appropriate Cuban authorities.</p>

                        <p>Señor Oscar García Montes, who became Cuban Minister of Finance on about
                            July 17, spent the week ending July 14 in Washington discussing with Mr.
                            Mersereau of the Export-Import Bank the terms of the authorizing
                            legislation to be presented to the Cuban <pb n="189" xml:id="pg_189"
                                facs="0197"/>Congress in connection with the $25,000,000
                            Export-Import Bank credit. This document as agreed upon was then
                            referred to the Cuban Government.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Messersmith telephoned on the afternoon of July 18 to say that
                            he had just been called by the Cuban Foreign Minister, Dr. Cortina, who
                            stated that he had been authorized by President Batista to inform the
                            Ambassador that the draft of the authorizing act was completely
                            satisfactory with the Cuban Government. The Cuban Government now awaits
                            the formal approval of this Government, presumably to be given through
                            Mr. Pierson of the Export-Import Bank, in order to present the proposed
                            legislation to the Cuban Congress<note n="85" xml:id="d158fn85">The
                                Cuban House of Representatives passed the Export-Import Credit Bill
                                on November 20, 1941.</note> with an appropriate message. The Cuban
                            Government wishes to proceed rapidly in the matter.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Messersmith stated that the Cuban Government planned to add to
                            the draft approved by García Montes and Mersereau a clause derogating
                            the law of last September which authorized the well-known $50,000,000
                            loan.</p>
                        <p>(Both Mr. Mersereau and Mr. Pierson later expressed their complete
                            approval of this additional clause.)</p>
                        <p>Following my conversation with Ambassador Messersmith I telephoned Mr.
                            Pierson who said that he had only just read the proposed legislation. He
                            stated that it was his general feeling that possibly the legislation
                            gave the Bank and the proposed Commission too much power and that we
                            might wish to propose modifications in this set-up.</p>
                        <p>On the morning of July 19 Ambassador Messersmith telephoned again. He
                            gave it as his very strong opinion that the various controls to be
                            exercised by the Bank and by the Commission were extremely necessary and
                            that they were heartily accepted by the Cuban Government. He furthermore
                            stated that the opposition in Congress would be much more apt to vote
                            the authorizing legislation if these controls and powers were there. He
                            gave it as his considered opinion that we should accept the authorizing
                            legislation as drawn up by Mersereau and García Montes. I said that the
                            Department would give the matter further thought and endeavor to
                            telephone him on July 21.</p>
                        <p>On July 21, and as a result of further consideration of the proposed
                            legislation, Mr. Warren Lee Pierson of the Bank, and Mr. Collado and Mr.
                            Bonsal of the Department agreed that some changes should be made which
                            would decrease the extent to which the Bank would become involved in
                            Cuban domestic affairs. This decision was communicated by telephone to
                            Ambassador Messersmith, who was advised that a draft of the proposed new
                            articles would be forwarded to him shortly.</p>

                            observed that the Cuban Government refers to the procedure previously
                            discussed of formulating its own draft legislation for submission to our
                            Government and consideration by it; but has decided that, in view of the
                            urgency of the matter and the rather critical financial situation facing
                            the Government, it would be preferable from the point of view of the
                            Cuban Government to have the assistance of an American expert on the
                            spot.</p>

                            informed of his submission of a memorandum outlining his financial

                                    would apply to import duties including those on the bound trade
                                    agreement items. While recognizing that assent on our part to
                                    having the increase apply to these consolidated items doubtless
                                    cannot be anticipated García Montes frankly hopes that our
                                    objections may be “for the record” and not insistent. I of
                                    course gave him no assurances on that score; on the contrary I
                                    said that having in mind tariff benefits which Cuba hopes to
                                    obtain through the pending trade agreement negotiations I felt
                                    this was a particularly inopportune moment for Cuba to try to
                                    raise the rates on American products. I stated further that for
                                    Cuba to endeavor to do so might in my opinion play directly into
                                    the hands of elements in the United States unfriendly to Cuba
                                    and finally I thought our protest would be prompt, emphatic and
                                    by no means merely “for the record.” If the foregoing represents
                                    the Department’s view I believe it would be helpful for me to be
                                    instructed so to inform the Minister as promptly as possible
                                    (having in mind that he hopes that this bill may be enacted

                        <p>122. Embassy’s despatch no. 2540 of August 23<note n="93"
                                xml:id="d162fn93">Not printed.</note> and telegram no. 111 of July
                            31 [<hi rend="italic">August 25</hi>]. The Minister of Finance today
                            reiterated his desire to obtain the assistance of the Export-Import Bank
                            in the purchase of 9 million dollars worth of gold to serve as backing
                            for an issue of 15 million peso certificates. He pointed out that the
                            Cuban peso is now virtually at par with the dollar so that the
                            additional peso certificates would affect the exchange market only
                            slightly if at all and that they will in fact be needed to meet the
                            increasing demand for currency during the coming grinding season in view
                            of the anticipated much larger sugar crop. Minister added that due to
                            improving collections the estimated 1941 budgetary deficit is being
                            revised downward and that if the Government can raise the necessary
                            amount through the sale in Cuba of short term treasury notes the
                            seigniorage from the proposed certificates issue would be used as
                            Government’s share of the capital of the proposed Central Bank. He is
                            however extremely anxious to have the seigniorage in prospect so he can
                            face “any eventuality”.</p>
                        <p>I am favorably impressed with the Minister’s estimate of the present
                            situation and probable future improvement; moreover I believe <pb
                                n="193" xml:id="pg_193" facs="0201"/>local commerce can now absorb
                            additional pesos and that they might even be urgently required in
                            connection with the next crop. Beyond this however it seems to me
                            desirable as a matter of general policy to extend this cooperation to
                            the Minister who is very helpful in all matters for betterment of
                            Cuban-American relationship and who is making genuine efforts to put
                            Cuba’s financial house in order.</p>

                        <p>139. The Minister of Hacienda called this noon to voice considerable
                            criticism of the alleged uncooperativeness of some of the Habana banks
                            with reference to his proposed short term $3,000,000 credit operation
                            (he has hoped to meet the anticipated deficit by placing 1,000,000 with
                            the banks, 1,000,000 with the insurance companies and the balance with
                            the hacendados).</p>
                        <p>The heads of the three American banks called this afternoon at my
                            request. I explained that the Embassy was of course making no
                            recommendation but that I hoped an informal discussion of the general
                            situation might be helpful. I pointed out that in my opinion Dr. García
                            Montes is making very creditable efforts in connection with government
                            finances; also that the American Government is shortly to cooperate by
                            furnishing a requested mission to help establish a central bank et
                            cetera.</p>
                        <p>The Chase Bank is apparently fully willing to participate in the credit
                            operation. The National City Bank seems willing if somewhat
                            unenthusiastic. The Boston Bank takes a legalistic and critical view of
                            the whole proceedings (as apparently does the Royal Bank of Canada).</p>
                        <p>The Minister now tells me that he is investigating the possibility of
                            carrying out the operation on a smaller scale with certain of the banks
                            separately instead of through the clearing house.</p>

                            August 13, 1941 transmitting a formal request of the Cuban Government
                            for technical <pb n="194" xml:id="pg_194" facs="0202"/>experts in

                        <p>The Department has arranged with the Treasury and the Board of Governors
                            of the Federal Reserve System to send to Habana a technical mission made
                            up as follows: <list>
                                <item>Mr. Harry D. White, Assistant to the Secretary of the
                                    Treasury,—Chief of Mission.</item>

                                    Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.</item>
                                <item>Mr. George B. Vest, Assistant General Counsel, Board of
                                    Governors of the Federal Reserve System.</item>
                                <item>Mr. George A. Eddy, Division of Monetary Research, Treasury
                                    Department.</item>
                                <item>Mr. Harry Spiegel, Division of Monetary Research, Treasury
                                    Department.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>Arrangements are being made to have the mission arrive in Habana about
                            October 7. You will be informed by telegraph as to the exact arrival
                            dates and other details. It is contemplated that the mission may remain
                            some four weeks; Mr. White will remain only a short while at the outset
                            and may return later to Habana.</p>
                        <p>The Department has considered carefully the suggestion that Mr. Louis S.
                            Rosenthal, Vice President of the Chase National Bank, participate in the
                            work of the mission. The Department does not believe that it would be
                            desirable for the Government of the United States to request Mr.
                            Rosenthal’s services for this purpose. It does feel that his advice and
                            assistance would be of undoubted benefit to the technical mission, and
                            suggests that it would be entirely proper for the Minister of Finance to
                            request his services as consultant.</p>
                        <p>The appropriate agencies of the United States have given careful
                            consideration to the request of the Minister of Finance for the
                            assistance of the Export-Import Bank in facilitating the preparation of
                            15,000,000 pesos of notes which would be issued against a reserve of
                            $9,000,000 of gold. It is pointed out that the Government of Cuba could
                            arrange such an operation without the extension of any credit at all,
                            since it would require only the small amount of funds involved in the
                            manufacture of the notes. As such notes were delivered and issued in
                            Cuba the Cuban Government could quite readily acquire gold bars in New
                            York for purposes of reserve. This Government feels that the decision to
                            take such action must lie with the Government of Cuba. It wishes to
                            point out, however, that such action at this point might not be entirely
                            consistent with the projects worked out by <pb n="195" xml:id="pg_195"
                                facs="0203"/>the Government of Cuba with the assistance of the
                            technical mission, and that it would be desirable to postpone such
                            action pending the arrival in Habana of the mission. The mission would
                            be prepared, if requested, to study at once and advise with the Minister
                            of Finance regarding such an operation, and if it were finally
                            determined to go ahead with it, the operation would not have to wait for
                            the completion of all other parts of a general monetary and banking
                            program which might be recommended.</p>
                        <p>Although the Government of the United States believes that it would be
                            desirable thus to postpone decision in the matter, the Export-Import
                            Bank is prepared to undertake to facilitate the operation on a basis
                            similar to that described above, if such is the determination of the
                            Cuban Government.</p>
                        <p>Please discuss these matters with the Cuban authorities and inform the
                            Department at once if the plans for the technical mission are
                            satisfactory.</p>

                            <p>[The American Technical Mission to Cuba filed four reports (none
                                printed). The first report (837.51/2852), which was made in November
                                1941, dealt with some of the more immediate financial problems
                                confronting the Cuban Government. The second report (837.51/2871),
                                issued in April 1942, was concerned with the establishment of a
                                central bank and the reconstituting of a stabilization fund. The
                                third report (837.51A/66) appeared 2 months later. It was a
                                commentary on a draft monetary law and dealt with the gold content
                                of the peso, the purchase, ownership, and coinage of gold, etc.
                                Draft banking legislation was the subject of the fourth report
                                (837.51/2887), which was submitted in July 1942.]</p>

                                stated in the memorandum which we refer to in the preceding

                                paid by Cuban sugar upon its entry in the United States of

                                possible date. We base our request on the evident disadvantage
                                suffered by Cuban producers by reason of the Customs duties that
                                they are obliged to pay at the present time in the American Custom

                            <item>—Social legislation of a constitutional nature at present in force
                                in Cuba has considerably increased the wages of laborers. The war
                                freight rates are practically annulling all the increases in prices
                                of sugar for exportation for the Cuban producer; and the Cuban sugar
                                industry which is and always shall be a great economic and war

                            <item>—On the other hand, our imports from the United States, rather
                                than diminishing by reason of the war, have increased, inasmuch as
                                the Cuban people at the present time purchase in the United States
                                almost all of the products that were formerly purchased in
                                Europe.</item>

                                States, operates with a visible inequality for our producers who see
                                no increase in their facilities for exportation, while the American
                                producer has extraordinarily improved his position as compared to
                                previous conventions.</item>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>—In this respect we cannot hesitate to point to the fact that Cuba
                                has granted, in an indirect but effective manner, special advantages
                                to American rice which was formerly imported in Cuba in
                                insignificant quantities, and that this product at the present time
                                has reached a figure greater than $7,000,000 per annum, and for this
                                special concession the Government of Cuba has received no
                                compensation by way of reciprocity.</item>

                            <item>—We believe that with these arguments we have proved the justice
                                of our request, which tends simply to have the Honorable President
                                of the United States of America, in use of his legal authority,
                                reduce the custom duties paid by Cuban sugar on its entry in the
                                United States to the rate of 0.75 per pound.</item>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Ambassador</hi>: With regard to the purpose,
                            repeatedly declared by the Government of the United States, of putting
                            into effect, in an efficacious manner for Cuba, the economic cooperation
                            existing between our two countries, we deem it convenient to discuss
                            some fundamental points foreign to the matters of an eventual and
                            transitory nature which we discuss in other memoranda.</p>
                        <p>We should also refer to those concessions which, by affecting the
                            economic development of Cuba in a permanent manner, have as a
                            consequence a constant effect upon its economy, to the end that, in the
                            future, the economic crises which at present affect the country may be
                            prevented.</p>
                        <pb n="198" xml:id="pg_198" facs="0206"/>
                        <p>In this respect we are going to refer to those principal points affecting
                            Cuban production which need a revision with the purpose of affording a
                            permanent balance to the economy of the country.</p>
                        <p>1. —<hi rend="italic">Cigars</hi>. For different reasons the importation
                            in the United States of manufactured tobacco has been reduced to
                            insignificant figures, at times not exceeding $200,000 in value. This
                            violent decrease in our exports of cigars to the United States of
                            America has produced a crisis in this industry, which is the greatest in
                            its history.</p>
                        <p>We have not the aspiration of improving the situation which it normally
                            had, but to restore in part the position which Cuba occupied in the year
                            1930.</p>
                        <p>It is deeply abnormal that, due to the close economic relations existing
                            between both countries, a product of the nature of Cuban manufactured
                            tobacco cannot enter the United States to the extent of finding an
                            appreciable market, and that it has been really eliminated from the
                            market of the United States.</p>
                        <p>To remedy this serious situation we desire that, under the existing
                            system of quotas, there be granted to Cuban manufactured tobacco a
                            minimum annual import quota in the United States of twenty million
                            cigars, free of duty. Inasmuch as this reduction is made subject to a
                            quota, and due to the insignificant quantity that it means in comparison
                            with the United States consumption, this can in no way affect the
                            interior commerce of this product manufactured by the national industry.
                            We should remember that, as regards the importation of leaf tobacco, the
                            manufacturers of American cigars have always agreed that the custom duty
                            granted the Cuban quota be very low.</p>
                        <p>It has been admitted that American tobacco needs the Cuban leaf in order
                            to maintain its standard of perfection and of production. The fact that
                            cigars manufactured in Cuba are also found in the United States market,
                            in moderate proportions, maintains the taste of the consumer for this
                            article, and facilitates, propagates and increases national consumption,
                            which is also made with Cuban leaf.</p>
                        <p>2. —<hi rend="italic">Cattle</hi>. The area of land that was used for the
                            cultivation of sugar cane has been decreasing progressively due to the
                            restrictions ordered for lack of markets for our chief export product.
                            As a consequence, the unoccupied zones have been converted into new
                            cattle farms. Inasmuch as the internal consumption cannot increase due
                            to the bad economic condition of the country a serious overproduction
                            has resulted with the consequential drop in prices and the threat of
                            actual ruin for the small cattle raisers. After a very careful study the
                            conclusion has been reached that only the exportation of cattle might
                            balance the situation that has arisen. Pursuant to the prior fulfilment,
                            in the strictest manner, of the established quarantine regulations
                            regarding the eradication of ticks for the importation of cattle <pb
                                n="199" xml:id="pg_199" facs="0207"/>on the hoof in the United
                            States, it is requested that the Government of the United States grant
                            Cuba a special annual quota with low duties for the importation of Cuban
                            cattle, giving it for that purpose an individualized share in the
                            general quota which under the title “Other countries” appears in the
                            United States Tariffs.</p>
                        <p>3. —<hi rend="italic">Sugar</hi>. With regard to this subject, we aspire
                            to a revision of the existing agreements in order to obtain, through a
                            modification of their terms, a more equitable treatment for Cuban sugar
                            under the American sugar legislation, with the following objectives: <hi
                                rend="italic">First:</hi> To assure it a higher percentage than it
                            enjoys at the present time in the assignment of the annual quota which
                            it is granted for supplying the market of consumption of the United
                            States; in this respect we consider acceptable, as a minimum, the
                            participation that was granted Cuba under the Costigan-Jones Act<note
                                n="1" xml:id="d167fn1">Act of May 9, 1934; 48 Stat. 670. Its purpose
                                was to “include sugar beets and sugar cane as basic agricultural
                                commodities under the Agricultural Adjustment Act.”</note> which was
                            in force when the Reciprocity Treaty in force between Cuba and the
                            United States was signed, and which logically, since it served as the
                            basis for that Treaty, should not have been changed to the detriment of
                            Cuba, without any reciprocity whatever by reason of these changes; <hi
                                rend="italic">Second:</hi> To extend the period of duration of this
                            system until it is made permanent, or to extend it to the maximum limit

                            reduce the custom duties and the internal taxes at present encumbering
                            Cuban sugar, in such a way, that our sugar industry may subsist under
                            conditions of stability and may afford the country, in a social and
                            labor order, the returns that naturally appertain to it.</p>
                        <p>I beg Your Excellency to acquaint the Government of the United States of
                            the viewpoints of the Government of Cuba above set forth and I have the
                            assurance that in kindly doing so, Your Excellency will make use of the
                            cordial interest and thorough understanding which distinguish your
                            efforts for the reaching of the best solutions to our economic
                            problems.</p>

                            receipt of the Department’s instruction no. 755 of July 9, 1941<note
                                n="2" xml:id="d168fn2">Not printed.</note> referring to the several
                            requests which have been made in recent months by the government of Cuba
                                <pb n="200" xml:id="pg_200" facs="0208"/>that a further
                            supplementary trade agreement be negotiated between the United States
                            and Cuba and to my despatches on this subject.</p>
                        <p>The Department authorizes me to inform the Cuban Minister of State
                            through an <hi rend="italic">Aide-Mémoire</hi> that our government is
                            now prepared, once an accord has been reached with the Cuban government
                            on the proposal set forth in its instruction under reference, to issue
                            public notice of intention to make a further agreement supplementary to
                            the trade agreement concluded on August 24, 1934.</p>
                        <p>In accord with this instruction I prepared an <hi rend="italic"
                                >Aide-Mémoire</hi> and called on the Minister of State yesterday. I
                            conveyed to him the substance of the information in the Department’s
                            instruction no. 755 under reference, and I left with him an <hi
                                rend="italic">Aide-Mémoire</hi>, of which a copy is transmitted
                                herewith.<note n="3" xml:id="d168fn3">Not printed.</note></p>
                        <p>The Minister of State expressed his deep satisfaction with this proposed
                            action of our government and said he would immediately get in touch with
                            the President in order to be able to make an appropriate reply. I
                            discussed with him fully the Department’s instruction and the procedure
                            to be followed.</p>
                        <p>I said the first step would be for the Cuban government to inform us that
                            it was prepared to proceed with negotiations on the basis of the <hi
                                rend="italic">Aide-Mémoire</hi> which I was leaving with him. Once I
                            could inform my government that the Cuban government was prepared to
                            proceed on this basis, the appropriate arrangements would be made in the
                            Department of State for public notice of intention to make a further
                            agreement supplementary to the trade agreement concluded on August 24,
                            1934. I emphasized that such notice would have to be given
                            simultaneously by both governments. I made it clear that it was
                            absolutely essential for the normal and successful progress of these
                            negotiations that nothing whatever be said by the Cuban government with
                            regard to this matter until public announcement was made simultaneously.
                            I did not fail to bring to the Minister’s attention how important it was
                            that this question of the possibility of negotiations be kept for the
                            present in strict confidence and until both governments were prepared to
                            simultaneously announce the negotiations. The Minister said he
                            thoroughly understood and would see that there would be no premature
                            statement of any kind here and would exercise all the necessary reserves
                            in this matter.</p>
                        <p>I said to the Minister that the list of articles on which we were
                            prepared to consider concessions must be an interesting one to the Cuban
                            government and indicated that a sympathetic understanding by us of
                            Cuba’s problem would be shown. I presented to him various considerations
                            why it would be inadvisable for the Cuban government <pb n="201"
                                xml:id="pg_201" facs="0209"/>to make any suggestions for the
                            addition of further articles to this list on which the Cuban government
                            might desire concessions. I intimated strongly that the articles
                            mentioned in the <hi rend="italic">Aide-Mémoire</hi> were the only ones
                            on which my government would be prepared to consider concessions and
                            that the inclusion of further articles might prejudice the successful
                            course of the eventual negotiations. The Minister said he clearly
                            understood this and that there would undoubtedly be a desire here to
                            include further articles but he felt he could assure me that the
                            government of Cuba would not request the addition of further
                            articles.</p>
                        <p>The Minister of State expressed some interest in knowing what would be
                            the articles on which our government might request concessions from the
                            Cuban government. I told him that according to my instructions my
                            government was not prepared at this time to submit such a list but that
                            I could assure him it was not contemplated by us to request an extensive
                            list of concessions, and that the request which we would make will take
                            fully into consideration the existing economic and financial situation
                            in Cuba. The Minister seemed to be satisfied with this and I believe
                            that our failure to indicate the list of articles on which we will ask
                            concessions will not interfere with a favorable response by the Cuban
                            government.</p>
                        <p>I did not consider it advisable to say anything to the Minister that we
                            might ask for a concession on rice. This question is a delicate one and
                            I think it would be inadvisable to raise it at this time. The Department
                            is aware that American rice pays only one-half the duty on admittance
                            into Cuba which is paid on rice from all other origins, with the
                            exception of Siam. In the case of Siam there is a further penalty duty.
                            American rice, therefore, enjoys an extraordinary exceptional position
                            in the Cuban market. Practically all of the rice imported into Cuba now
                            comes from the United States, and I am informed that the American market
                            has not been recently in a position to meet the full demand so that
                            there have been imports from Ecuador.</p>
                        <p>As considerable quantities of rice came into Cuba from the Far East until
                            several years ago, and as these imports paid the full duty, there has
                            been a considerable loss of revenue to the Cuban Treasury through this
                            almost complete dependence on the American rice market. I do not have
                            accurate figures at hand, but I am informed that during the last fiscal
                            year the Cuban government lost about a million dollars in custom
                            revenues through the increased imports from the United States, which pay
                            only one-half the duty. I am informed that this fiscal year there will
                            be a loss of an additional million dollars, so that this year the loss
                            in revenue will be approximately two million dollars.</p>
                        <pb n="202" xml:id="pg_202" facs="0210"/>
                        <p>In view of the distressing financial conditions in Cuba and that this
                            loss of revenue is very considerable in its economy and in the
                            government’s budget, I am inclined to think that it would not be
                            advisable for us, without going into this matter most carefully, to
                            raise the question of rice. We are already in an exceptional position,
                            which position arouses a certain amount of criticism, and the rice
                            growers here have been recently very vocal in regard to this matter. I
                            have brought out this factor as I believe that we should consider very
                            carefully all aspects in this matter before raising the question of
                            rice.</p>
                        <p>I informed the Minister of State that once the public announcement had
                            been decided upon and made, there would be a period of a month during
                            which the Department of State through the Division of Trade Agreements
                            would be holding hearings as a result of the public notice.<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d168fn4">This public notice was given on July 26; see

                            government could not begin until at least a month after the public
                            notice had been simultaneously made.</p>
                        <p>The Minister seemed to be agreeable to the suggestion of our government
                            that the negotiations and signature of the agreement which may be
                            reached be carried on in Habana.</p>
                        <p>I expect to get an early response from the Cuban government and shall
                            immediately communicate with the Department upon the receipt of any
                            reply.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With further reference to the proposed
                            supplementary trade agreement with Cuba, public hearings were held on
                            September 8, 9 and 10, 1941 following the issuance on July 26 of a
                            public notice of intention to negotiate such an agreement, the
                            recommendations of the trade-agreements organization regarding the
                            concessions to be proposed to the Cuban Government have now been
                            approved, and there is attached hereto the text of a note which you are
                            authorized to hand to the Minister of State setting forth this
                            Government’s proposals.</p>
                        <p>The utmost importance is attached to the conclusion of the proposed
                            agreement at the earliest possible date. With this in mind, every effort
                            has been made to include in this Government’s original offers of
                            concessions on products imported from Cuba, the most favorable possible
                            customs treatment. It is believed that the offers which you <pb n="203"
                                xml:id="pg_203" facs="0211"/>are now authorized to present to the
                            Minister of State represent the maximum concessions which this
                            Government is in a position to grant.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the requests of this Government for concessions by the
                            Cuban Government on products imported from the United States, it may be
                            noted that although the number of items is relatively large as compared
                            with those on which concessions are offered, it is believed that the
                            value of the trade involved in all items on which duty reductions are
                            requested does not exceed, with the exception of rice, more than about
                            3,500,000 pesos per year. Regarding rice, it will be noted that a
                            request has been made for a reduction in duty from 1.85 to 1.50 pesos
                            per hundred kilograms. It is believed possible that the Cuban Government
                            may present a counter-proposal on this item with a view to limiting the
                            application of the reduced duty to a specified quantity of rice of
                            United States origin. The trade-agreements organization will, for your
                            own information, be prepared to consider such a counter-proposal.</p>
                        <p>It is hoped, in view of the limited amount of Cuban import trade covered
                            by this Government’s requests for concessions, that the Cuban Government
                            may find it possible to grant those requests with a minimum of
                            negotiation.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the general provisions of the proposed agreement, it is
                            believed that the comment relating thereto which appears in the attached
                            note to the Minister of State, covers the principal points involved in
                            this Government’s proposals. In view of the nature of the changes or
                            additions suggested, and the fact that the Government of Cuba would gain
                            definite advantages from the standpoint of ability to secure greater
                            revenues, it is not anticipated that serious difficulty will be
                            encountered in obtaining agreement by the Cuban Government to our
                            proposals. A definitive text covering the proposed changes will be sent
                            to you as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>Full powers to sign the proposed agreement on behalf of this Government,
                            once an accord has been reached with the Cuban Government, are being
                            prepared for transmittal to you in the near future.</p>
                        <p>Very truly yours,</p>

                                negotiate a supplementary agreement with Cuba was issued on July 26,
                                1941, together with a list of the products on which the Government
                                of the United States would consider the possibility of granting
                                concessions in the proposed agreement. A supplementary list of

                            <p>The public hearings scheduled by the announcement of July 26 were
                                held in Washington on September 8, 9 and 10, 1941, and the
                                appropriate agencies of my Government have subsequently been engaged
                                in studying the information received orally and in writing as a
                                result of the public notice. I am now instructed to submit to you
                                proposals with respect to the concessions which the Government of
                                the United States is prepared to offer, the concessions desired from
                                the Government of Cuba and the various changes which are suggested
                                in the general provisions of the existing agreement.</p>
                            <p>In formulating the concessions which the Government of the United
                                States is prepared to grant to Cuba in return for the concessions
                                requested upon United States export products, my Government has been
                                guided by the thought that the negotiations for the proposed
                                agreement should be brought to a successful conclusion as rapidly as
                                possible for reasons which I am sure Your Excellency fully
                                appreciates. In an effort to curtail the length of the negotiations
                                as much as possible, therefore, my Government has included in its
                                first proposals what are believed to be the maximum possible
                                concessions which can be offered to Cuba. These concessions are set
                                forth in detail in Enclosure I to this note.<note n="8"
                                    xml:id="d169fn8">Not printed.</note></p>
                            <p>With respect to sugar, the most important item in the proposed
                                agreement from the viewpoint of Cuba, it will be noted that an offer
                                is made to reduce the duty on standard raw sugar of Cuban origin
                                from 90 cents to 75 cents per hundred pounds. In addition, and of
                                greater importance to Cuba than the reduction in duty which is
                                offered, is the arrangement whereby, through the elimination of the
                                present note following item 501 in the agreement, the rate
                                applicable to imports into the United States of sugar of Cuban
                                origin will remain at 75 cents per hundred pounds even if
                                legislation controlling United States sugar production and imports
                                is no longer in force. If in such an event, however, and as a result
                                of unforeseen developments and of the concession granted, the
                                President of the United States found that sugar were being imported
                                from Cuba in such increased quantities <pb n="205" xml:id="pg_205"
                                    facs="0213"/>and under such conditions as to cause or threaten
                                serious injury to domestic producers, he would, if he found that the
                                public interest would be served thereby, impose such restrictions
                                upon the concession, or modify it by the imposition of quantitative
                                regulations or otherwise, to the extent necessary to prevent such
                                injury. A draft text of the provisions to carry out the foregoing
                                proposal will be found in the note following item 501 in Enclosure
                                I.</p>
                            <p>With respect to tobacco, it will be noted from Enclosure I that
                                concessions are offered in the rates of duty on wrapper, filler and
                                scrap tobacco of Cuban origin which will have the effect of reducing
                                those rates to the maximum extent permitted under the Trade
                                Agreements Act.<note n="9" xml:id="d169fn9">Approved June 12, 1934;
                                    48 Stat. 943.</note> My Government is not offering a further
                                reduction in the rate of duty on Cuban cigars or to increase the
                                amount of filler and scrap tobacco which is entitled to entry at the
                                reduced rates of duty.</p>
                            <p>In addition to the foregoing, my Government is prepared to offer the
                                maximum reductions in duty permitted by the Trade Agreements Act on
                                the following products of Cuban origin: various medicinal products
                                of animal origin, classified under tariff paragraphs 5, 23 and 34;
                                marble chip or granite, under tariff paragraph 214; mangoes,
                                paragraph 746; and fruits in their natural state or prepared or
                                preserved, under paragraph 752.</p>
                            <p>On the various types of molasses and sugar sirups, under paragraph
                                502, an offer is made to bind the existing rates of duty against
                                increase. On the first item listed under paragraph 502, an
                                arrangement has been provided in the note following the item whereby
                                imports of products from Cuba classified under this item will be
                                admitted at the present reduced rates of duty up to an amount of
                                1,500,000 gallons per year, with a higher rate, equal to 20 percent
                                below the statutory rate, applying to imports in excess of that
                                amount. The note also provides that entries of Cuban molasses and
                                sugar sirup under this item shall not be permitted to enter at the
                                reduced rates of duty applying to imports of these products from
                                other countries by virtue of any concession granted in a trade
                                agreement with a foreign country other than Cuba. It is also
                                provided that entries from Cuba under this item shall not be
                                admitted at reduced rates of duty under customs quotas on such
                                products which may be granted in other trade agreements. The effect
                                of the foregoing is to grant Cuba an exclusive concession applicable
                                to 1,500,000 gallons per year, while at the same time preserving for
                                the beneficiary for whom it was originally intended, the concession
                                under item 502 in the trade agreement between the United States and
                                the United Kingdom, effective January 1, 1939.<note n="10"

                                imports of products under this item from Cuba which would restrict
                                the importation of such articles to an amount less than the quota
                                for liquid sugar of Cuban origin specified in Section 208 of the

                                blackstrap and high-test molasses, my Government is prepared to bind
                                the existing low rate of duty.</p>
                            <p>On fresh, chilled or frozen beef and veal, an offer is made to reduce
                                the present rate of 4.8 cents per pound applicable to Cuban products
                                under this item, to 3 cents per pound. On fresh, chilled, frozen,
                                prepared or preserved frog legs, an offer is made to reduce the
                                specific rate of duty by the maximum extent permitted, from 4.8 to
                                2.4 cents per pound, and to reduce the minimum ad valorem duty from
                                16 percent to 10 percent.</p>
                            <p>With respect to grapefruit, a concession is offered consisting of an
                                extension of two weeks, or until October 15, in the present period
                                from August 1 to September 30, inclusive, during which grapefruit of
                                Cuban origin may enter the United States at the reduced rate of duty
                                of 6/10ths of one cent per pound. In connection with this
                                concession, my Government would desire to enter into an
                                understanding with the Cuban Government, through an exchange of
                                notes, on the subject of maturity tests and grade and size standards
                                of grapefruit exported from Cuba to the United States.</p>
                            <p>With further reference to paragraph 752, my Government would be
                                prepared to expand the existing concession on mango pastes and pulps
                                and guava pastes and pulps, consisting of a 50 percent reduction in
                                duty, to include all fruit pastes and fruit pulps.</p>
                            <p>With regard to lima beans, paragraph 765, my Government is prepared
                                to modify the language of the existing concession in a manner which
                                it is believed will permit fresh frozen and shelled lima beans to be
                                imported into the United States from Cuba under the same conditions
                                as those applying to lima beans in the pod, on which a concession
                                was granted in the trade agreement in 1934.</p>
                            <p>In return for the foregoing concessions which my Government is
                                prepared to offer, there are set forth in detail in Enclosure
                                    II<note n="12" xml:id="d169fn12">Not printed.</note> the
                                concessions which are desired for the benefit of United States
                                export products. The requests cover reductions in duties, bindings
                                against increased rates and certain requests involving special
                                tariff problems affecting exports from the United States.</p>
                            <pb n="207" xml:id="pg_207" facs="0215"/>
                            <p>Rice is the most important single commodity covered by the requests,
                                and on this item a reduction in duty is sought.</p>
                            <p>In general, the amount of trade involved in my Government’s requests
                                covers but a very modest proportion of total Cuban imports, and it
                                is believed that Your Excellency’s Government will find it possible
                                to respond favorably to those requests.</p>
                            <p>With respect to the form in which the requests made by my Government
                                are presented in Enclosure II, it is believed that the concessions
                                sought will be found to be clearly indicated in the final column in
                                those cases in which duty reductions are desired. The underlined
                                words appearing in certain of the descriptions of articles indicate
                                the new or additional nomenclature which is desired to replace or
                                amend existing language. In the case of the first item, razor
                                blades, under item 53–F, the concession requested consists of a
                                reduction from 10 percent to 3 percent in the Public Works Tax
                                applicable to that product. In the case of item 166–D, wooden crates
                                for packing fruits and vegetable products, the concession sought
                                consists merely of a binding of existing tariff treatment.</p>
                            <p>With reference to the general provisions of the existing agreement,
                                my Government believes that the occasion of the present negotiations
                                offers an opportunity to effect a number of changes which appear to
                                be desirable. The amendments suggested are for the most part
                                intended to provide greater flexibility in the operation of the
                                agreement and to incorporate improvements in the technical drafting
                                of several provisions; proposals are also included which will have
                                the effect of providing greater freedom of action for the Government
                                of Cuba. Specifically, my Government wishes to propose the following
                                changes in or additions to, the existing general provisions:</p>
                            <p>It is believed that Article V, on quotas, might be replaced by a more
                                modern text. It is felt that certain of the clauses contained in the
                                present text might more appropriately be included in a general
                                reservations article applicable to the entire agreement. The
                                specific text which will be suggested is that which has been
                                developed by my Government for use in trade agreements.</p>
                            <p>My Government is prepared to agree to the liberalization of Article
                                VIII, as amended, on internal taxes, for the purpose of making
                                reciprocal the provisions relating to compensating taxes, which are
                                now unilateral, and of releasing the Cuban Government from the
                                existing restrictions against imposing new or increased internal
                                taxes for general revenue purposes on products imported from the
                                United States and included in Schedule I of the agreement.</p>
                            <p>With respect to Article X, on currency depreciation, my Government
                                believes that this provision as drafted has not served any useful
                                purpose and should be eliminated.</p>
                            <pb n="208" xml:id="pg_208" facs="0216"/>
                            <p>On the question of the exchange control provisions, Article XI, my
                                Government feels that the present draft should be replaced by
                                provisions such as those which have been developed more recently in
                                the light of experience with current exchange problems.</p>
                            <p>Due to the change which is proposed in the note following item 501,
                                relating to sugar, it is believed that appropriate changes should
                                also be effected in the third paragraph of Article XVII of the
                                agreement, as amended.</p>
                            <p>I anticipate being able in the immediate future to provide Your
                                Excellency with a definitive text embodying the foregoing proposals
                                of my Government.</p>
                            <p>Accept, Excellency, the assurances of my most distinguished
                                consideration.</p>

                            having reference to the proposed supplementary trade agreement with
                            Cuba, it was stated that the trade-agreements organization had
                            recommended a reduction in the rate of duty on sugar from $.90 to $.75
                            per 100 pounds, the lower duty to remain in effect whether or not sugar
                            legislation is continued after the end of this year. Also recommended
                            was a proposal that under certain circumstances the Executive could
                            limit the amount of Cuban sugar imported at a reduced rate of duty and
                            fix a rate between $.75 and $1.50 on imports above a specified
                            amount.</p>
                        <p>Certain recent developments make it appear desirable to modify the
                            previous recommendations. In view of this Government’s plans to purchase
                            the entire Cuban sugar crop for the coming year, and possibly that for
                            the year following, there would be no need for emergency control of
                            sugar imports from Cuba by executive action, as contemplated in the
                            recommendations above referred to. Also, the Cuban Government has been
                            concerned that an unrestricted right on the part of this Government to
                            curtail imports does not, in appearance at least, adequately safeguard
                            Cuban interests.</p>
                        <p>In view of the foregoing considerations, therefore, it is now recommended
                            that the provision for the control of sugar imports by executive action
                            during the emergency be dropped and that in order to afford some measure
                            of protection for Cuban interests, the agreement should, in addition to
                            specifying a reduced rate of duty, simply <pb n="209" xml:id="pg_209"
                                facs="0217"/>provide that no measure shall be made effective in
                            connection with the reenactment of sugar legislation or otherwise, which
                            would adversely affect the position of the Republic of Cuba as a
                            supplier of sugar for the United States market as compared with its
                            position under the provisions of the Sugar Act of 1937.</p>
                        <p>I should appreciate being informed whether this recommendation meets with
                            your approval.</p>

                            supplementary trade-agreement negotiations, the legislative situation in
                            regard to sugar has become so uncertain as to necessitate a
                            reconsideration by this Government of its proposals concerning item 501
                            of Schedule II. You are therefore instructed to convey the following
                            information to the Foreign Minister of Cuba.</p>
                        <p>As you are aware, H. R. 5988 was passed by the House on December 1.<note
                                n="16" xml:id="d171fn16"><hi rend="italic">Congressional
                                Record</hi>, vol. 87, pt. 9, p. 9298. The Senate approved the House
                                bill with an amendment on December 19 and the House in turn approved
                                the bill as amended by the Senate on the same day; see <hi
                                    rend="italic">ibid.</hi>, pp. 10021 and 10069. The President
                                signed the bill on December 26; see 55 Stat. 872.</note> This bill,
                            and the companion bill S. 2041, are scheduled for consideration by the
                            Senate Finance Committee next Wednesday, December 10. Although the
                            interested Departments are doing all they can to prevent favorable
                            action on these bills in the Senate, it is impossible to foresee what
                            the outcome will be or what effect the outcome will have on the proposed
                            trade agreement.</p>
                        <p>However, if pending sugar legislation should be passed by Congress, and
                            if the President, for compelling reasons, should feel constrained to
                            sign it or let it become law, it would of course be necessary to change
                            the text of the proposed agreement to conform to the new legislation
                            rather than to the Sugar Act of 1937.</p>
                        <p>If pending sugar legislation should not be enacted, the way probably
                            would be cleared for the signature of a trade agreement, otherwise
                            mutually satisfactory, which would contain in addition to the present
                            note to item 501 another note to cover periods when there might be no
                            sugar-quota legislation in effect in the United States. The additional
                            note would avoid the criticism that during such periods this Government
                            would be powerless to deal with the situation.</p>
                        <p>In the case of the second alternative, there would be inserted in the
                            agreement, immediately following item 501, a note (Note I) the <pb
                                n="210" xml:id="pg_210" facs="0218"/>English and Spanish texts of
                            which are enclosed.<note n="18" xml:id="d171fn18">Not printed.</note>
                            The existing note to item 501 would remain, as Note II.</p>
                        <p>In connection with the new note to item 501, the Embassy should bring to
                            the attention of the Cuban authorities the following specific points: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>The note is broadly similar to that which appeared in the
                                    draft text of the agreement transmitted with the Department’s
                                    instruction no. 935 of October 3, 1941,<note n="18"
                                        xml:id="d171fn1">Not printed.</note> with which the Cuban
                                    authorities are familiar.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>While the note would reserve to the President of the United
                                    States the right, subject to the conditions specified, to impose
                                    a customs quota on imports of Cuban sugar into the United
                                    States, the amount of the customs quota so established could
                                    not, under the new note, be less than a quantity equivalent to
                                    28.60 percent of the total sugar consumption requirements of the
                                    United States as estimated by the Secretary of Agriculture. The
                                    rate of duty for such customs quota could not be higher than
                                    $0.75 per 100 pounds of raw sugar (96° basis), and the rate of
                                    duty on imports in excess of the quota could not exceed $1.50
                                    per 100 pounds of such sugar.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>The share of 28.60 percent of the total consumption
                                    requirements of the United States which is specified as the
                                    minimum customs quota would be larger, in certain circumstances,
                                    than Cuba’s share of this market under the provisions of the
                                    Sugar Act of 1937; specifically, whenever such total consumption
                                    requirements are less than 6,682,670 short tons, raw value. The
                                    Embassy will recall that, under the Sugar Act of 1937, Cuba’s
                                    share decreases in the latter case by operation of the so-called
                                    “minimum provisions” of the Act, which assure to domestic areas
                                    a minimum amount of 3,715,000 short tons.</item>

                                <item>The note is of a purely emergency character, applicable only
                                    in the absence of sugar-quota legislation, and is designed
                                    solely to permit alleviation of possible distress, to the
                                    benefit of Cuba as well as of domestic and other suppliers,
                                    until such time as appropriate legislative measures could be
                                    taken.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>With reference to the Embassy’s despatch no. 2966 of November 19,
                                1941,<note n="18" xml:id="d171fn2">Not printed.</note> transmitting
                            a copy of a memorandum handed the Cuban authorities on the same date,
                            the Department has observed that the memorandum contains a definitive
                            proposal by this Government to grant the maximum reduction in the rates
                            of duty on molasses and sugar syrups classified under paragraph 2 of
                            Schedule II. When the possibility of such a concession was mentioned in
                            the course of a telephone conversation, it was clearly stated that the
                            proposal was tentative and that it had not yet been approved by the
                            Trade Agreements Committee. Objection was subsequently expressed to
                            granting this concession on the ground that it would be open to
                            criticism as benefiting monopoly interests. In any event the
                            communication of this proposal <pb n="211" xml:id="pg_211" facs="0219"
                            />to the Cuban Government prior to its approval by the trade-agreements
                            organization is unfortunate. The Embassy is now requested to withdraw
                            this proposal unless, in its opinion, withdrawal would complicate
                            current negotiations for the purchase of the Cuban sugar crop by
                            interjecting a discussion of the tariff on molasses as an element to be
                            taken into account in computing the basic price of the crop.</p>
                        <p>It is noted from the Embassy’s telegram no. 186 of November 28,
                                1941,<note n="19" xml:id="d171fn19">Not printed.</note> that the
                            Cuban authorities continue to press for inclusion in the second indented
                            paragraph of Article VII of the Spanish draft text of the words
                            “taxativamente económico”, so as to qualify the manner in which an
                            object of the agreement must be considered by either Government to have
                            been impaired or nullified by a measure adopted by the other Government
                            before the former may take action under the provisions of the paragraph.
                            Although the Department believes that any such qualification would be
                            undesirable, it would be willing, if the Cubans continue to insist on
                            this point, to agree to the insertion of the Spanish equivalent of the
                            adverb “materially” to modify the verbs “anular o menoscabar”; in the
                            English text “materially” would be inserted immediately before
                            “nullifying or impairing”. If Cuban insistence on using the words
                            “taxativamente económico” continues, you are authorized to accede,
                            inserting in the English text, between the words “impairing” and “any”,
                            the words and punctuation “, in an economic sense,”.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the text of Schedule I of the proposed agreement, the form

                                    be covered by paragraph 1 of Article IV of the draft text,

                                    that paragraph the words “Column 2 of”. This deletion has been
                                    made in the Department’s copies of the English and Spanish texts
                                    of the agreement.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>With regard to the outstanding items comprising the original Schedule I
                            requests of this Government and on which no concession has yet been
                            received, the Embassy is authorized to make the following proposals to
                            the Cuban authorities:</p>
                        <p>1. This Government will agree to withdraw its request for concessions on
                            smoking tobacco (item 297–C) and cigarettes (item 297–E) provided the
                            Cuban Government will withdraw its request for a concession on cigars.
                            The Embassy may recede from this position by maintaining an offer to
                            reduce the rate of duty on Cuban cigars to $1.80 per pound plus 10
                            percent ad valorem provided the concession on smoking tobacco is
                            obtained as originally requested.</p>
                        <p>2. With respect to rice (item 253–B) this Government desires that the
                            Embassy make an effort to obtain on a basis of deferred application of
                            the concession following the form indicated in the Department’s telegram
                            no. 360 of November 19, 1941,<note n="21" xml:id="d171fn21">Not
                                printed.</note> a rate of duty of 1.65 pesos per 100 kilograms
                            applicable to a customs quota of 220,000,000 pounds (100,000,000
                            kilograms) of rice imported from the United States in any calendar year,
                            the rate of duty applicable to extra-quota amounts to remain at 1.85
                            pesos per 100 kilograms and the minimum preference to remain at 50
                            percent.</p>
                        <p>In this connection, the proposal on rice advanced by the Commercial
                            Attaché which was communicated by telephone on December 2 has been
                            carefully examined. However, apart from other considerations, it was
                            felt that further delay would be avoided by proceeding on the basis of
                            the latest recommendations of the trade-agreements organization
                            regarding rice and other Schedule I items.</p>
                        <p>3. At the same time that the foregoing proposal on rice is submitted to
                            the Cuban authorities you should also request further consideration of
                            the following concessions, most of which, it will be noted, have been
                            modified: 95–A and 95–B (salt), rate of duty originally requested;
                            ex–105–E, (shaving soaps and creams), elimination of the ad valorem
                            portion of the present duty; 106–C, (toilet powders, etc.), rate of duty
                            originally requested, the reduced rate to apply, however, only to rouge,
                            face-paint of any color, including cosmetic pencils or crayons, and skin
                            creams; ex–108–A (industrial corn <pb n="213" xml:id="pg_213"
                                facs="0221"/>starch), rate of duty of 3.64 pesos per 100 kilograms,
                            which rate is the same as the present rate on corn products classified
                            under item 256–C and the concession rate obtained for edible starch and
                            fecula of corn in the note to item 290–B of the draft text of Schedule
                            I; 161–D (Kraftboard), rate of 1.20 pesos per 100 kilograms; 241–B,
                            (“tocineta” or fat pork), rate of 7.50 pesos per 100 kilograms, together
                            with a request for the same rate on item 238–C (pork); 269–G (specified
                            poultry feeds), insertion of a note under this item classifying therein
                            all mixed feeds for poultry; 269–H, (other feeds, not specifically
                            classified), insertion of a note under this item providing for a rate of
                            duty of 1.40 pesos per 100 kilograms on mixed feeds for livestock.</p>
                        <p>In the event the Cuban authorities refuse to grant the requested
                            concession on rice, you are authorized to drop rice from the
                            negotiations, in which case you should place further emphasis on the
                            concessions (other than that on rice) outlined above, and in addition
                            the following requests should be made: ex–256–C (specified products of
                            white corn), rate of duty as originally requested; 269–E (specified
                            livestock feeds), rate of duty of 0.90 pesos per 100 kilograms; 269–G
                            (specified poultry feeds), rate of duty of 1.05 pesos per 100 kilograms
                            (if this concession is secured, the same rate should be obtained for
                            mixed feeds for livestock in the proposed note to item 269–H, mentioned
                            above); 307–B (rubber heels for shoes), rate of 0.195 peso per kilogram;
                            307–D and 307–E (canvas rubber footwear), rates of 0.26 and 0.24 per
                            kilogram, respectively; 307–K (articles of rubber not specifically
                            classified), binding of the present rate of 0.1625 peso per kilogram
                            with respect to the entire item.</p>
                        <p>Of the foregoing proposals, other than that relating to rice, the Embassy
                            should place greatest emphasis, in relative order, on 95–A and 95–B;
                            241–B and 238–C; ex–256–C; and ex–106–C: of least importance are, in
                            relative order ex–105–E; 307 items; 269–E; 269–G, with respect to rate
                            of duty; and ex–269–H.</p>
                        <p>In connection with item 314–B (tires) and 314–C (tubes), the Department
                            has reason to believe, from conversations with the Minister of the
                            Presidency of Cuba, Dr. López Castro, that the Cuban Government has
                            decided to grant the concessions requested. The Department feels that
                            concessions on these items are essential, particularly in view of the
                            volume of trade involved.</p>
                        <p>The only remaining point is the proposed exchange of notes relating to
                            grapefruit standards, on which a definite decision should be obtained
                            from the Cuban authorities as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>Very truly yours,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of the Department’s instruction no. 1080 of December 4, 1941
                            with respect to the negotiations in progress for the Supplementary Trade
                            agreement. Although this instruction was dated December 4, 1941 and was,
                            I understand, placed in the airmail that evening, it did not reach this
                            Embassy until Sunday afternoon, December 7, 1941. The instruction was
                            given immediate study that afternoon and evening by Mr. Nufer and Mr.
                            Smith and myself in order that I might talk with the Minister of State
                            and his associates the following morning. The instruction, however,
                            reached my desk just at the moment when we had the news of the Japanese
                            attack on Hawaii and the Philippines. The Cuban Government, in accord
                            with its traditional friendship with us, immediately began the
                            preparations for a declaration of war on Japan and the steps growing out
                            of it, I was therefore in constant touch with the higher Cuban
                            authorities from the afternoon of December 7 until the evening of
                            December 9. The various Ministers engaged in the trade agreement
                            negotiations were under the necessity of being in the Congress and in
                            Cabinet meetings all of December 8 and 9 until late in the night. It
                            was, therefore, not until the morning of December 10 that we were able
                            to meet and that I was able to discuss with them the supplementary trade
                            agreement negotiations on the basis of the Department’s instruction of
                            December 4.</p>
                        <p>I should like to note, however, that in fact no time was lost through
                            this delay, as in view of the nature of the instructions with regard to
                            the sugar note which is dependent upon the progress of legislation in
                            the United States, it would have been impossible to reach any definite
                            conclusions in this respect, and is not now, as we have nothing so far
                            of a definite character which we can place before the Cubans. I am
                            merely making this statement so that it may be clear that any delays
                            which may be occurring now and which may be endangering the conclusion
                            of the trade agreement and of the sugar purchase in time, before the end
                            of this year, are not due to them.</p>
                        <p>I had a four-hour meeting on the morning of December 10 with the Minister
                            of State, Dr. Cortina, the Prime Minister, Dr. Saladrigas, Dr. López
                            Castro and the Minister of the Treasury, Dr. García Montes. I had
                            suggested to the Minister of State that all these be present so as to
                            facilitate their having all adequate background.</p>
                        <pb n="215" xml:id="pg_215" facs="0223"/>
                        <p>I first presented a memorandum in English and Spanish of which copies are
                            transmitted in a separate despatch covering my instructions on sugar. I
                            explained that legislative positions at home made it impossible for the
                            Department to state that it could maintain the sugar note to Item 501 as
                            we had last presented it. I went thoroughly into our legislative
                            procedure and the background of our trade agreement legislation and
                            explained the difficulties which arose out of our negotiating on sugar
                            at the same time that Congress was considering legislation on the same
                            subject. While I found adequate understanding of our legislative
                            procedure and of the difficult situation created by the presentation of
                            the Fulmer Bill,<note n="22" xml:id="d172fn22">To amend the Sugar Act of
                                1937 (50 Stat. 903), 55 Stat. 872.</note> it is quite natural that
                            the Cuban negotiators could not understand any recession from our
                            position and from the note which we had offered them. I found them,
                            however, entirely reasonable and we discussed in detail the two
                            alternative procedures set forth in the Department’s instruction of
                            December 4, and which I had given them in the memorandum above referred
                            to. I think the Cubans would have been prepared to accept either of the
                            two alternatives, but of course I was not in a position to present
                            either of them in a final or definite form.</p>
                        <p>The Cuban negotiators were much disturbed over the uncertainty of the
                            position and the dependency of the completion of the trade agreement and
                            the sugar purchase on the pending legislation in the Congress. They fear
                            that this uncertain legislative position may continue for some days so
                            that it will not be possible to carry through the trade agreement and
                            the purchase so that they will be effective at the end of this year.
                            From the trade agreement viewpoint this is of primary importance as it
                            would mean that otherwise the rate of 1.50 on sugar may become effective
                            on January 1, 1942. This would be as undesirable for us as it would be a
                            disaster for Cuba. Further, the sugar purchase can not be completed
                            until the 15 points provided for in the trade agreement are certain. The
                            completion of the sugar purchase is holding up the many arrangements
                            which the sugar industry and mills must make for the grinding season,
                            the opening of which is rapidly approaching. Now that this sugar
                            purchase has been agreed to by the Cubans they can make no arrangements
                            until they know that this agreement for the sale is accepted by both
                            parties. There is, therefore, the greatest uncertainty here which
                            amounts to anxiety.</p>
                        <p>Completely aside from the economic and commercial factors involved there
                            is the psychological and political factor which I am sure the Department
                            is keeping in mind. The Cuban Government declared war on Japan within 36
                            hours after we did. It has declared <pb n="216" xml:id="pg_216"
                                facs="0224"/>war on Italy and Germany in about 8 hours after we did.
                            Although Cuba is practically defenseless and open to attack, the Cuban
                            Government and people did not for one moment hesitate to support
                            overwhelmingly these measures of full cooperation with us when larger
                            and stronger of our neighbors have taken half-way measures or so far,
                            none at all. Now that we have offered Cuba the 15 point reduction in the
                            duty, and a minimum participation in our market (which has been the
                            aspiration of Cuba for decades) and we have made arrangements for this
                            sugar purchase, we can not let the Cubans down in any respect when their
                            cooperation has been so complete.</p>
                        <p>Yesterday the President of Cuba gave instructions to the Cabinet that
                            under no circumstances would Cuba refuse to carry through the sugar
                            purchase on the terms last offered by their negotiators. After the
                            proclamation of war by Japan and the almost certain position of imports
                            from the Philippines and Hawaii that they will be nil, there was a
                            tendency on the part of certain people here to influence the Government
                            to draw back from the purchase and to ask for a higher price. President
                            Batista said that they had made their promises before the war on the
                            sugar purchase and now since the declaration of war by Cuba and the
                            United States, Cuba must carry through her word no matter how
                            disadvantageous the purchase might prove to Cuba. This is an indication
                            of the spirit in which the Cuban Government is working and it is a
                            spirit which must be recognized, I believe, in our negotiations of every
                            character with Cuba, including the trade agreement. Not to do so would
                            fail to take into account major political considerations at this time
                            which are of the most primary and vital importance to us.</p>
                        <p>In view of the uncertainty in the legislative position and the necessity
                            for arriving at some conclusion so that the trade agreement and the
                            sugar purchase can be completed and effective before the end of the
                            current year, the Cuban negotiators indicated that they would be
                            prepared to have Mr. López Castro go to Washington at a moment’s notice
                            with full powers to arrive at some arrangement which would make the
                            signature of the agreement possible within the next few days. I said
                            that I would be prepared to accompany Mr. López Castro, together with
                            Mr. Gerald Smith of the Trade Agreement Division who is now in Habana.
                            In telephone conversations with the Department I have emphasized the
                            desirability of this trip as a measure to avoid possible failure of
                            completion of negotiations and the sugar purchase in time. Mr. López
                            Castro and I are prepared to leave Cuba by the first plane any day and
                            unless legislative position is adequately cleared up today I strongly
                            advise this course of action as the only one which offers hope of
                            completing these important arrangements in time.</p>
                        <pb n="217" xml:id="pg_217" facs="0225"/>
                        <p>I discussed the various items, as instructed by the Department, with the
                            Cuban negotiators.</p>
                        <p>The Cuban negotiators agreed to give the concession on tires and tubes
                            which we requested if it was considered essential. I informed them that
                            it was, under my instructions, essential and this concession may
                            therefore be considered as granted.</p>
                        <p>With respect to rice, I submitted the last proposal of the Department
                            informally in writing. The Cuban negotiators said that the rice market
                            was ours any way and would be for years and they wanted it to be ours.
                            On the other hand, if they went to the Congress with the trade agreement
                            giving us the quota for 100,000,000 kilos, the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Autenticos</hi> would offer such strong opposition to the agreement
                            that it might destroy the agreement and they could not take this risk. I
                            agree with them as to the danger and we can not insist on the concession
                            in the form which we have asked. The Cubans have proposed as their final
                            counter-proposal on rice a concession which would provide for a rate of
                            duty to the United States of $1.50 per hundred kilograms, applicable to
                            a tariff quota of 65,000,000 kilograms per year, with the rate of duty
                            being unbound on excess-quota imports, but with the margin of preference
                            being maintained at 50% on both quota and excess-quota shipments, and
                            the concession to become effective at some future date following the
                            termination of the present hostilities. I would suggest a period of a
                            year. This, I am sure, is the best the Cubans can do and, knowing the
                            situation as I do, I am sure that it is the best and the last offer they
                            can make.</p>
                        <p>I strongly recommend our acceptance of this proposal. It protects our
                            position adequately for it is extremely unlikely that the Cubans would
                            raise the duty above 1.85 for any rice imports from the United States.
                            If this proposal is not satisfactory to us, which I believe it should
                            be, it would be better to drop rice from the negotiations. All of us
                            here in the Embassy recommend the acceptance of the Cuban proposal as
                            being in our interest.</p>
                        <p>I informed the Cubans that we were prepared to maintain our concession
                            granted on leaf tobacco but that we would have to have a concession on
                            smoking tobacco if the concession on cigars was to be maintained. I
                            found on this matter a united front on the part of the Cuban
                            negotiators, who stated that Cuba could make no concessions on
                            cigarettes or smoking tobacco at this time. The Minister of State, for
                            the Cuban negotiators, said that at the outset of the negotiations we
                            had agreed to give the maximum concession we could on leaf tobacco and
                            cigars and there was no mention of specific <hi rend="italic">quid pro
                                quo</hi>. The Cuban Government must insist on the granting of the
                            maximum concession on leaf tobacco and cigars as essential to the
                            completion of the agreement. They could not agree to make any concession
                                <pb n="218" xml:id="pg_218" facs="0226"/>on cigarettes or smoking
                            tobacco. The tobacco industry in Cuba was in such a lamentable position
                            that they could not go to Congress, which was considering a subsidy of
                            the industry, with a reduction on either cigarettes or smoking tobacco.
                            It was not a question of the amount of trade involved, it was the
                            psychological factor on the second agricultural industry of Cuba. The
                            Minister of State pointed out that at the outset of the negotiations the
                            Cuban Government had indicated publicly that we were prepared to give
                            the maximum concession on leaf tobacco and cigars without specific <hi
                                rend="italic">quid pro quo</hi>. It would be suicide for members of
                            the Government to try to defend any other position before the Congress.
                            I therefore strongly recommend that we maintain the maximum concession
                            offered to the Cubans on leaf tobacco and cigars and withdraw our
                            requests for cigarettes and smoking tobacco. It means nothing to us in
                            reality.</p>
                        <p>In the matter of the seasonal period of concession on fresh United States
                            vegetables except tomatoes and cabbage, I asked for the extension to
                            November 30 in place of September 30 which had been offered previously
                            by the Cubans. I was told that they could not possibly give the
                            extension to November 30 but would do so up to October 31. They pointed
                            out that certain Cuban vegetables came actively into the market during
                            November and that it was impossible for them to extend the concession
                            further than October 31.</p>
                        <p>I requested further the consideration of the concession on salt and was
                            informed under no circumstances could this be considered or granted.
                            There was excess production of salt in Cuba now and this was one
                            concession which President Batista, for reasons already given the
                            Department, would not grant. This Embassy thoroughly understands the
                            Cuban position and the concession may be considered definitely
                            refused.</p>
                        <p>I requested the concessions on shaving soaps and creams and toilet
                            powders, as instructed by the Department and these were definitely
                            refused on the ground that they [<hi rend="italic">there?</hi>] were
                            struggling industries here producing these articles and that no further
                            concession could be made.</p>
                        <p>I requested the concession on industrial corn starch (Ex 108–A)—that is,
                            a rate of 3.64 pesos per 100 kilograms which was granted.</p>
                        <p>I presented further the requests, as instructed by the Department, on
                            Kraftboard, “Tocineta”, certain specified poultry feeds (269–G) and
                            other feeds, n. s. p. f. (269–H) all of which were refused and in my
                            opinion for good and adequate reason.</p>
                        <p>Although the Government of Cuba had given us a final offer on rice which
                            I consider satisfactory, I raised further the items which I was
                            instructed to raise in the Department’s instruction of December <pb
                                n="219" xml:id="pg_219" facs="0227"/>4, 1941, if the rice concession
                            was refused. That is, I took up the items on specified white corn
                            products (Ex 256–C), specified livestock feeds (269–E), specified
                            poultry feeds (269–G), rubber heels for shoes (307–B), canvas rubber
                            footwear (307–D and 307–E) and articles of rubber, n. s. p. f., all of
                            which were refused for what I believe were adequate and sufficient
                            reason and I do not think we should raise them further.</p>
                        <p>We discussed the grapefruit notes and the Cuban Government indicated that
                            they would not be able to meet requirements of the notes for the present
                            and they therefore, renounced the concession offered on grapefruit,
                            which may therefore be considered as eliminated from the
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>I wish to emphasize that in granting the concession on tires and tubes
                            the Cuban Government has made a very important concession for this means
                            that one factory, ready to operate and a second almost ready to operate,
                            will not be able to do so. The Cuban negotiators stated that they had
                            verified that there was crude rubber to the value of $264,000 in
                            warehouses here which had been brought in for these factories. The Cuban
                            Government felt, however, that it should not foster the development of
                            an uneconomic industry. The concession granted is an important one and
                            shows the good faith of the Cuban Government in trying to grant
                            concessions on manufactured articles which it believes should be
                            imported by Cuba, as solely as possible, from the United States, even if
                            it involves sacrifices in revenue.</p>
                        <p>I have cleared up all the points in the Department’s instruction of
                            December 4, 1941, with the exception of the molasses concession which I
                            was requested to withdraw. I did not take this up in the conversation
                            yesterday as I did not wish further to complicate the situation with
                            regard to the sugar purchase. I am giving this further study and hope to
                            clear up this on the basis of the Department’s instruction under
                            reference within the next 24 hours.</p>
                        <p>I know that the Department will be somewhat disappointed with the results
                            which we were able to secure on certain concessions which I was asked to
                            take up again. I wish to emphasize, however, that I believe that keeping
                            in mind all the factors involved, we have the maximum of what we should
                            ask.</p>
                        <p>This negotiation is one which is governed in many respects by major
                            political factors and by considerations peculiar to American-Cuban
                            relationships. It can not be considered on purely a commercial
                            give-and-take basis and especially under the extraordinary circumstances
                            prevailing at this time. If we consider that the concessions given by
                            the Cubans are few we must bear in mind that, so far as the Cubans are
                            concerned, they consider this supplementary negotiation as one <pb
                                n="220" xml:id="pg_220" facs="0228"/>to correct inequities which had
                            grown out of the original trade agreement and its supplement. As I have
                            indicated to the Department in previous reports, the trade agreement was
                            under severe criticism in Cuba because of the disadvantageous manner, on
                            the whole, in which it was working out for Cuba. There was grave danger
                            that the Cuban Government might be under the necessity of revoking the
                            agreement. The pressures to this end were to my knowledge serious, while
                            the inequities which may have grown out of our trade agreement and its
                            supplement were the result of circumstances over which neither we nor
                            Cuba had any control. There was no doubt, however, that the agreement
                            was working too strongly to our advantage.</p>
                        <p>I should like to repeat that it is in my opinion essential for the
                            maintenance of American-Cuban relationships on the satisfactory basis
                            they now have that we complete within the next week, so that it may
                            become effective by the end of this year, a trade agreement which gives
                            Cuba these 15 points reduction in the sugar duty and a minimum
                            participation in our sugar market of not less than 28.60% of our
                            consumption needs. Unless we take these major actions now and under the
                            existing circumstances, and which we have led the Cubans to expect, we
                            shall be introducing an element of uncertainty, distrust and complete
                            disillusionment in our relationships with Cuba, which I believe will
                            cause us in the end great trouble and more loss than to Cuba. I have
                            tried to make this considered opinion of mine so clear to the Department
                            that I do not believe it is necessary to reiterate it in more specific
                            detail. I cannot, however, present this controlling factor to the
                            Department with all the clarity possible because of this vital
                            importance to us.</p>
                        <p>The major points and the details of this despatch were communicated to
                            Mr. Hawkins, the Chief of the Division of Commercial Agreements,
                            yesterday afternoon.</p>

                            to him Saturday on the basis of the Department’s telegram 401 of

                            agreement on those terms must be conditioned upon not only the 75 cent
                            duty but also upon the conclusion of the early “shortnote” under item
                            501 assuring to Cuban sugar treatment not inferior to that under the
                            Sugar Act of 1937. The delay in the Cuban acceptance of the terms may be
                            traced to the change in the text of the note which apparently was
                            dictated by the House passage of the O’Mahoney–Fulmer bill. The
                            probability now that the note to item 501 may, in view of the action of
                            the other day of the Senate Finance Committee, be worded as originally
                            proposed, makes it possible for the <hi rend="italic">colonos</hi> and
                                <hi rend="italic">hacendados</hi> and the Cuban Government to
                            approve the transaction.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Messersmith wanted to emphasize as well the splendid collaboration of
                            President Batista, who on Monday the 8th thoroughly squelched those
                            Cubans who in view of the war developments urged that Cuba walk out of
                            the agreement.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador added that López Castro and Mañas are ready to come to
                            Washington at any moment to work out the details of the purchase
                            arrangement. I suggested to the Ambassador it would be desirable for
                            them to wait until we sent a signal. The Ambassador indicated that López
                            Castro felt it might be unwise to come back to Washington before the
                            legislative situation is entirely cleared up.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador proposed to call Mr. Hawkins by noon today with regard to
                            final details of the trade agreement.</p>
                        <p>I asked Mr. Messersmith whether he felt any concern is justified by item

                        <p>For the Secretary and Under Secretary. We are running the grave risk of
                            creating a situation in American-Cuban relationships most prejudicial to
                            ourselves in Cuba for the near and for the long range and in our whole
                            inter-American position in these difficult times.</p>
                        <p>In the current trade-agreement negotiations we offered the Cubans a
                            75-cent duty rate on sugar and a short sugar note which grants a
                            position for Cuban sugar in our market not inferior to that of the Sugar
                            Act of 1937. We requested the Cubans to sell us their 1942 sugar crop
                            and, under the favorable atmosphere created by the trade-agreement
                            negotiations and the above offers, the Cubans have agreed to sell their
                            1942 crop at the reasonable price fixed by us although they consider the
                            transaction from a purely commercial point of view a disadvantageous one
                            for them.</p>
                        <p>I have tried to make clear in my despatches and letters that if we recede
                            from the offers we made in the trade-agreement negotiations of the
                            75-cent rate and the short sugar note granting a no worse position for
                            Cuban sugar in our market than under the 1937 Act, or under the
                            projected bill as reported from the Senate Committee, both the trade
                            agreement and the sugar deal cannot be signed by the Cubans and will
                            fall through.</p>
                        <p>The trade-agreement negotiations are complete except for the form of the
                            sugar note on which I am awaiting confirmation. If the trade agreement
                            and the sugar deal are to become effective we must sign the trade
                            agreement not later than December 22.</p>
                        <p>The Cubans will, I am sure, not sign the trade agreement or close the
                            sugar deal on our offer, which they are prepared to do if we sign the
                            trade agreement, unless the trade agreement carries the 75-cent rate and
                            the short sugar note above referred to.</p>
                        <p>Our relations with Cuba through our wise policies have never been on a
                            sounder or firmer basis and Cuba is today the American republic in which
                            the good-neighbor policy has borne its most mature fruit. She has
                            declared war on Japan, Germany and Italy without delay and without fear
                            and is prepared to follow our lead resolutely and to cooperate in the
                            fullest measure in her power. If the trade agreement fails, through this
                            recession from our offer, we will be creating here a psychological and a
                            realistic situation which will undo the work <pb n="223" xml:id="pg_223"
                                facs="0231"/>of years in a few weeks and which will create
                            political, economic and labor repercussions here which will cause
                            exceedingly difficult problems for us not only in American-Cuban
                            relationships but the repercussions of which will be felt in the other
                            American republics.</p>
                        <p>Whatever our problems at home may be in giving this short sugar note,
                            they are small as compared with those which we would be creating by
                            receding from our offer at this crucial time.</p>
                        <p>I therefore recommend in our interest that I be authorized to include
                            without delay this short sugar note in the trade agreement and to
                            proceed with the signature at the latest on Monday, December 22. The
                            text of the agreement otherwise has been fully agreed to by us and by
                            the Cubans.</p>

                                    changes should be examined during war time and that therefore
                                    consideration of the changes should be postponed to after the
                                    war.</item>

                                <item>In view of this Congressional intent it becomes desirable to
                                    substitute an exchange of notes binding the Executive Branch of

                                    clearly wants to consider new legislation later in the form of
                                    the “short note”. The latter, as the Secretary, who is an expert
                                    in legislative procedures and psychology, feels, would do far
                                    more harm to Cuba than good. Therefore the proposed exchange of
                                    notes, while binding only the Executive is really in practice a
                                    better guarantee for Cuba than the short note.</item>

                        <p>414. Reference your telephone conversations yesterday and particularly
                            your confidential message to Mr. Welles and me. You will recall that the
                            short note to item 501 was proposed after the Cubans had submitted a
                            counterproposal relating solely to possible action by the Executive not
                            to the Congress; and that we made this proposal on November 7, the day
                            on which proposed sugar legislation was introduced. The Cubans were slow
                            to accept the short note and meanwhile the legislative picture here was
                            changing. In view of recent legislative developments, growing out of
                            Japan’s attack on us, which could not have been foreseen at the time we
                            proposed the short note, I instructed Hawkins to telephone you last
                            Saturday to keep the sugar provisions of the trade agreement fluid until
                            we could have an opportunity to see what the Senate Finance Committee’s
                            report would contain and what the ultimate outcome in regard to the
                            pending sugar legislation would be.</p>
                        <p>We have now seen that report, which contains the following statement:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Admittedly, the bill does not give full recognition to the needs
                                    and ambitions of all groups in the sugar industry. These needs
                                    and ambitions were forcefully represented to the Committee and
                                    with many of them the Committee is sympathetic. Nevertheless,
                                    since these matters are not of immediate consequence during the
                                    period of war in which the Nation is engaged, it was deemed
                                    expedient to postpone their consideration to a time when more
                                    thorough examination of them is possible.”</p>

                            view of the cooperative spirit shown by the Committee in rejecting the
                            House bill which would have been adverse to Cuba, I think that we would
                            risk offending members of Congress and perhaps jeopardize Cuba’s future
                            position and other matters of interest to the Department and the
                            Administration if we went ahead with the trade agreement on the basis of
                            the short note which would be interpreted as an attempt to forestall
                            Congressional action after the emergency is over.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, I want you to make every effort to persuade the Cubans that it
                            would be in their own interest to accept in lieu of the short note an
                            exchange of notes the substantive portions of which would read as
                            follows: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                    concerned over the possibility of the adoption of measures in
                                    the United States which would adversely affect the position of
                                    Cuba as a supplier of sugar for the United States market as
                                    compared with its position under the provisions of the Sugar Act

                            “principle” of the earlier sugar note. The exchange of notes meets this

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform the Department
                            that the Minister of State, Dr. Cortina, requested me last evening to
                            call on him this morning as he had a memorandum which he wished to
                            deliver to me. I called on him this morning and he handed me the
                            appended communication from the Cuban Government with the memorandum
                                attached,<note n="34" xml:id="d178fn34">Neither printed.</note> in
                            which the Cuban Government requests the assistance of our Government
                            through the Import-Export Bank in the financing of 500,000 tons of
                            sugar.</p>
                        <p>The Minister made quite a number of observations which I am not able to
                            transmit in this despatch as I have just returned from the long
                            conversation which I have had with him, and the airmail is leaving
                            within the next hour.</p>
                        <p>The Minister stated that he hoped that our Government would be able to
                            give immediate consideration to this request of the Cuban <pb n="228"
                                xml:id="pg_228" facs="0236"/>Government as the grinding season would
                            begin shortly and whatever action was taken would have to be taken
                            without delay. He said that this assistance was of immediate and
                            imperative necessity for the maintenance of the economy and social
                            situation in Cuba.</p>
                        <p>I told him that I would transmit this communication without delay to my
                            Government and that I could make no observations with regard to the
                            memorandum as the details of such an operation as that proposed by the
                            Cuban Government would have to be dealt with by the Import-Export Bank
                            and other Departments and agencies of our Government in collaboration
                            with the Department of State. The only observation I made in this
                            connection was that he knew that in our conversations I had always
                            expressed the opinion that the maintenance of sugar production at
                            present levels in Cuba was the most important factor in maintaining the
                            Cuban economy under the conditions which we had to envisage for the next
                            year and for probably several years longer.</p>
                        <p>The Minister stated that this request of the Cuban Government was
                            separate and apart from the loan negotiations in progress. In connection
                            with the loan negotiations, he would give me next week for transmission
                            to the Department a memorandum of proposals of the Cuban Government with
                            respect to the loan.</p>
                        <p>I shall transmit by the airmail tomorrow a more complete report on this
                            request of the Cuban Government with such observations and
                            recommendations which this Embassy may be in a position to make. I may
                            say at this time that I believe that the present request of the Cuban
                            Government should be considered as carefully and as benevolently as may
                            be in our power, as I am of the opinion that no one thing which we can
                            do for Cuba will be of more immediate benefit to Cuba and to us than
                            appropriate steps to maintain for the present year, and if possible for
                            several years longer, the production of sugar in Cuba at present
                            levels.</p>

                            It is anticipated that the Cuban Government will fix a crop of 2,000,000
                            Spanish long tons <pb n="229" xml:id="pg_229" facs="0237"/>exclusive of
                            any extraordinary quota which may be financed by the Export-Import Bank.
                            On the basis of a crop of this size, I recommend that the bank offer to
                            finance the production during 1941 of a special additional quota of
                            400,000 tons the financing to be made at the rate of one cent per pound
                            upon the following conditions:</p>
                        <p>Loan to be against 5-year notes secured by pledge of sugar as well as
                            allocation of 6 cents per bag production tax and provision for diversion
                            of not exceeding 50,000 tons of pledged sugar per annum for sale in the
                            American market within the American quota if equivalent amount is not
                            sold elsewhere at price not lower than the financing price.</p>
                        <p>Authorization for the financing should be obtained from the Cuban
                            Congress which should include in the enabling legislation provision for
                            the extension without substantial modification of Decree Law 522.<note

                            Committee of the Export-Import Bank today approved your recommendation
                            for a credit to be extended on 400,000 Spanish long tons of sugar. The
                            Committee fixed the rate of interest at 3.6 percent. You are requested
                            to put forward an additional clause whereby amortization would be
                            speeded up if the world sugar price rises to 1.5 cents. [Clayton.]</p>

                            Spanish long tons of sugar, is outlined in the attached memorandum of
                            conversation between Mr. Beaulac and Dr. Cortina.<note n="40"

                                <item>Dr. Cortina exhibited an extraordinary sensitiveness to
                                    American “pressure” toward extending 522.<note n="42"
                                        xml:id="d181fn42">Decree Law 522.</note> While Cuba
                                    recognizes the wisdom of extending this legislation, Dr. Cortina
                                    pretended [<hi rend="italic">contended</hi>] that we should rely
                                    on Cuba to do so “spontaneously”. Mr. Beaulac agreed and
                                    expressed regret that Cuba had not taken advantage of numerous
                                    opportunities to act “spontaneously”. The Chargé appeared to
                                    obtain Dr. Cortina’s agreement that the proposed sugar financing
                                    now added an important technical reason for extending 522
                                    (thereby extending the life of the Sugar Institute, which would
                                    be the principal factor in the operation).</item>

                                <item>Cortina regretted that the proposal fixed the sum of 400,000
                                    tons instead of the originally requested 500,000 tons but said
                                    that he would not make an issue of it.</item>

                                <item>Dr. Cortina also appeared to wish to bargain about the rate of
                                    advances. Cuba has asked for $4.00 per bag. The Export-Import
                                    Bank offers $3.25. Dr. Cortina hoped the ante could be raised to
                                    $3.50. His principal arguments related to “cost of production”,
                                    which the Chargé pointed out would not have been covered even by
                                    the $4.00 rate. The cost of production on sugar is not covered
                                    in any way by prices obtained by Cuba’s contribution to the
                                    world market in recent years.</item>

                                <item>In relation to the general subject of aid to Cuba, the Chargé
                                    found an opportune occasion to review the past three years of
                                    Cuban-American relations which have been largely made up of
                                    generous offers of cooperation by the United States conditioned
                                    upon certain acts of cooperation on the part of Cuba which have
                                    long been obviously necessary. … Dr. Cortina apparently conceded
                                    that Cuba should in fact now offer some concrete token of its
                                    willingness to cooperate.</item>

                                <item>The Foreign Minister … referred to the importance to the new
                                    administration’s stability and strength of “an achievement”. Mr.
                                    Beaulac, accepting this premise by implication, observed that
                                    while the United States had repeatedly shown a desire to assist
                                    and cooperate, the Cuban Government of recent years has
                                    exhibited no leadership in combatting attacks within Cuba on the
                                    United States and against the traditionally friendly United
                                    States-Cuban relations. This negative policy on the part of
                                    recent Cuban Governments stands in strange contrast to the Cuban
                                    Government’s attitude that it is up to us to extricate the Cuban
                                    Government from difficulties to the solution of which it has as
                                    yet made no contribution.</item>

                        <p>The net result of the conversation seems to have been that Cortina would
                            use Mr. Beaulac’s observations in discussing the sugar finance proposal
                            with the members of the Government, and the meeting with Mr. Pierson
                            scheduled for Friday night was postponed to Tuesday, when the Ambassador
                            is expected back.</p>

                            with representatives of the sugar industry, to discuss again the offer
                            of the Export-Import Bank to finance the production during 1941 of an
                            extraordinary sugar quota of 400,000 tons. The representatives of the
                            industry were informed at the meeting that the Export-Import Bank was
                            prepared to raise the financing price from $3.25 per bag to $4.00, the
                            other terms remaining unchanged.</p>

                            by an entirely reliable person, who was present. It is obvious that, in
                            contrast to its attitude during the first meeting, the Government warmly
                            commended the offer to the industry; and that the mill owners approved
                            the offer enthusiastically. The general impression is that the

                            sugar during 1941 will be carried out.</p>
                        <p>Particular attention is called to paragraph (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) on
                            page two of Memorandum No. 1. The device suggested provides for the sale
                            of a minimum amount of 50,000 tons annually in the world market, at
                            prices higher than the financing price, if possible, or at prices lower
                            than the financing price, if the Export-Import Bank approves. If such
                            sale in the world market cannot be made, an equivalent amount must be
                            sold in the United States market the following year, and the proceeds
                            from the sale of this sugar in excess of the financing rate may be
                            applied by the Institute to make up losses in the sale of additional
                            sugars in the world market at less than the financing price. The
                            proceeds of the 6¢ tax, after charges for interest and expenses have
                            been paid, likewise would be available for making up the difference
                            between the proceeds from sales of sugar in the world market at less
                            than the financing price and the proceeds which would have been received
                            if such sugar had been sold at the financing price. The result of the
                            device suggested would be to make it possible to dispose of the special
                            quota sugars more rapidly than otherwise possible. The Embassy believes
                            that the suggestion has merit; and it is an interpretation of the bank’s
                            offer to which the bank may agree without having to modify its
                            offer.</p>

                            developments, but I will no longer delay, and give you a brief if
                            somewhat sketchy picture.</p>
                        <p>The delay in the sugar arrangement being completed is not due to any lack
                            of interest by the Government, or even of the industry. I need not tell
                            you, who know the situation here so well, that such a question always
                            brings into play certain interests which may have no direct connection
                            with the matter. The Government has worked effectively. The <hi
                                rend="italic">hacendados</hi> have made no difficulty. The <hi
                                rend="italic">colonos</hi> are making difficulty because very
                            egotistically they would like to use the legislation which has to be
                            enacted in connection with the sugar arrangement, and which will of
                            course include renewal of decree-law 522, as an opportunity to get
                            parity with the <hi rend="italic">hacendados</hi> in the Sugar
                            Institute. In a way to give them such parity could be considered as a
                            substantial alteration of 522, and it is an alteration which I hope we
                            will not be asked to approve.</p>
                        <p>Parity for the <hi rend="italic">colonos</hi> in the Sugar Institute
                            might mean trouble in the future in an organization which has, on the
                            whole, functioned effectively. As it is now, the large mill owners, the
                            small mill owners, and the <hi rend="italic">colonos</hi>, have equal
                            representation in the Institute. This is fair and proper, as it
                            represents relative interest. The <hi rend="italic">colonos</hi> want to
                            get a position in the Institute to which they are not relatively
                            entitled, and I can see that with their having parity we might have all
                            sorts of trouble in the future.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">hacendados</hi> and <hi rend="italic">colonos</hi>
                            have given their formal approval to the Government to the sugar
                            arrangement. A small group is now preparing the legislation which will
                            have to be enacted by the Congress. The <hi rend="italic">colonos</hi>
                            and <hi rend="italic">hacendados</hi> were prepared to ask the
                            Government to accept the arrangement immediately, and work out the
                            details of the law and with the bank later. Cortina and Saladrigas<note
                                n="49" xml:id="d184fn49">Carlos Saladrigas, Cuban Prime
                                Minister.</note> took the attitude that everything would have to be
                            worked out, including an acceptable draft bill for the Congress, which
                            was satisfactory to us, before any announcement could be made. This is
                            characteristic of the helpful attitude which Cortina and Saladrigas have
                            taken recently. Both of them are eager that their relations with us
                            should be <pb n="234" xml:id="pg_234" facs="0242"/>on a correct and
                            sound basis, and they want any misunderstandings or difficulties
                            avoided. I hope to have a draft of the law in a day or two so we can
                            submit it to the Department, and after we say that it is satisfactory
                            then a formal announcement can be made by the bank and by the Cuban
                            Government that a sugar arrangement has been concluded.</p>
                        <p>I think there will be no difficulty in getting the authorizing act, which
                            includes the renewal of 522, through the Congress. Of course, there are
                            those who do not like the renewal of 522, nor the using of the 6 cents a
                            bag tax for the sugar arrangement, but the arrangement is so obviously
                            necessary that I am confident that, although there will be some voices
                            in the Congress against the bill, it will be carried.</p>
                        <p>I am sure that this sugar arrangement will be the most constructive thing
                            that we could do in the Cuban situation now, and it is most important
                            that it should go through, for without it there would be economic
                            distress in the country districts within three or four months, and I
                            fear that this would result definitely in political disorders. If we can
                            get this sugar arrangement through, it, together with the increased
                            demand for molasses, will help to stabilize the economic situation until
                            we can get some constructive action on credits for agricultural
                            diversification and public works.</p>
                        <p>I get it from every side that Cortina and Saladrigas have been most
                            helpful, not only in this sugar arrangement, but with respect to our
                            relations in general and to developments here. They are the best men now
                            in the Batista<note n="50" xml:id="d184fn50">President Fulgencio
                                Batista.</note> Government. Cortina has shown an extraordinarily
                            meticulous desire to keep everything on a sound and constructive basis.
                            Saladrigas is helping him. Casanova<note n="51" xml:id="d184fn51">José
                                Manuel Casanova, President of the Sugar Stabilization
                                Institute.</note> has on the whole been helpful, but he remains
                            Casanova, and I have had great difficulty in keeping him down on this
                            question of molasses. …</p>

                            <p>P. S. After reading this letter I think I should say that the second
                                paragraph on page 2 may be a little too optimistic, as there may be
                                some difficulty in getting the authorizing act for the sugar
                                arrangement through Congress. The <hi rend="italic">colonos</hi> are
                                behaving very badly. Most everyone is really pleased with the sugar
                                arrangement and wants it to go through. The <hi rend="italic"
                                    >colonos</hi>, however, are trying to use this opportunity to
                                get parity in the Sugar Institute. … The <hi rend="italic"
                                    >hacendados</hi> are <pb n="235" xml:id="pg_235" facs="0243"/>in
                                a weak position because, although they are right in the attitude
                                they are taking, they represent “capital” interests.</p>
                            <p>It is this difficulty over parity which is holding up the formal
                                acceptance by the Government of the sugar arrangement and its
                                completion. So far as the operation itself is concerned, there is
                                agreement and no serious question. I think it is important that this
                                question between the <hi rend="italic">hacendados</hi> and <hi
                                    rend="italic">colonos</hi> over parity be worked out before the
                                bill is introduced in the Congress. Casanova is one of the very few
                                    <hi rend="italic">hacendados</hi> in the Congress, while in the
                                House there are some 40 <hi rend="italic">colonos</hi> and in the
                                Senate I believe 9. If this matter is not ironed out before the
                                authorizing bill gets to Congress the <hi rend="italic">colonos</hi>
                                will try to fight it out there, and they will have popular support.
                                One amendment leads the way to others, and the whole bill might be
                                amended in such a way as to make it unacceptable to us and prevent
                                the completion of the sugar arrangement. I still believe this matter
                                will be worked out, but I wanted you to know what the delay is due
                                to and that it has nothing to do with the arrangement itself.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Sumner</hi>: The sugar financing bill passed
                            the House day before yesterday with only one vote against it. I
                            understand that this one adverse vote was cast by Carlos de la Cruz. You
                            may recall the Senate passed the financing bill with not a single vote
                            cast against it and with well over 40 Senators present at the time the
                            vote was taken. The President has signed the bill.</p>
                        <p>There has been a long delay in this financing measure being approved by
                            the Congress, but as I told you in my rather full letter of March 1<note
                                n="52" xml:id="d185fn52">Not found in Department files.</note> this
                            delay in many respects has had its advantages, for it made possible the
                            clearing up of many situations in the industry and the basis has been
                            laid for more stable conditions in the sugar industry. As I pointed out
                            in my letter of March 1 to you, longstanding difficulties between <hi
                                rend="italic">hacendados</hi> and <hi rend="italic">colonos</hi>
                            have been worked out on what seems to be a mutually satisfactory basis.
                            The Institute has been reestablished for the period of the sugar
                            arrangement, and the internal administration of the Institute is
                            improved as a result of all <pb n="236" xml:id="pg_236" facs="0244"
                            />these discussions and the financing law. Decree-Law 522 is renewed
                            without any alteration which we consider substantial. When we realize
                            how deep-seated and real were the difficulties between <hi rend="italic"
                                >hacendados</hi> and <hi rend="italic">colonos</hi>, what definite
                            criticism there was of the Institute and opposition to the prolongation
                            of its life, and how many interests were combined to prevent a
                            prolongation of Decree-Law 522, this action of the Cuban
                            Congress—especially the final vote on the financing bill—becomes all the
                            more significant. …</p>
                        <p>Although the financing bill is of primary importance and vital in the
                            maintenance of the economic, and therefore of the political, situation
                            in Cuba, there are many other reasons why this financing arrangement is
                            of importance and advantage to both Cuba and ourselves. Without this
                            financing arrangement the Institute was dead, and the present equitable
                            distribution of quotas would have been destroyed. Without the financing
                            arrangement it would have been impossible to secure the renewal of 522,
                            which, as you and I know, is essential to stable conditions in the sugar
                            industry. If 522 had not been renewed there would have been an orgy of
                            private interests, and Cuban and particularly American interests would
                            have been affected. You and I realize that this discrimination against
                            American sugar interests, which would have resulted from the failure to
                            renew 522, would have been the invitation for and opened the way to
                            discrimination against other American interests.</p>
                        <p>Growing out of the discussions which I have had with Batista, Cortina,
                            Saladrigas, and others, over this sugar financing, there have come the
                            most categoric declarations from them that under no circumstances must
                            American interests be prejudiced or injured. I think there is more than
                            words here, for I believe that the insistence which we showed with
                            respect to 522 has had a salutary influence all around. You have
                            performed a useful service in our relations with Cuba in general in
                            maintaining the Department’s position so consistently that the renewal
                            of 522 was of this primary importance.</p>
                        <p>I would like to think that we have passed another milestone on a road
                            which we are endeavoring solidly to construct.</p>
                        <p>I should add that, although there has been this delay in the passage of
                            the financing bill, it has not seriously affected either the economic
                            situation or the industry, as there was the basic belief all the time
                            that in some way or other the law would be voted in a satisfactory form.
                            Although the grinding quota had been fixed at two million tons the mills
                            were proceeding on the basis that the 400,000 provided by the bill were

                            Cortina is likely to go ahead more actively with the conversations <pb

                            was working on. My own preliminary impression is, without going into any
                            detail at this time, that sufficient ground has really been cleared by
                            the Cubans in meeting our conditions to enable us to go ahead. I am
                            keeping in mind your strictly confidential letter to me of February

                        <p>313. The Office of Production Management has recommended that the Federal
                            Loan Agency, acting through the Defense Supplies Corporation, make
                            arrangements to acquire the entire 1942 sugar crop of Cuba. The Defense
                            Supplies Corporation is ready to proceed immediately with negotiations.
                            You are requested to inform the Cuban Government in confidence of this
                            proposal and to invite it in behalf of the Federal Loan Agency to send
                            suitable representatives to Washington for this purpose if the proposal
                            meets with the approval of the Cuban Government. (The Department relies
                            upon you to convey in a discreet fashion the importance of selecting
                            qualified negotiators.)</p>
                        <p>The Department feels that this proposal goes a long way toward meeting
                            the aspiration of the Cuban Government and the sugar industry to be
                            consulted, as expressed in Foreign Minister Cortina’s letter of August
                            13 to you.<note n="56" xml:id="d186fn56">Not printed; this letter was
                                primarily a protest against the fixing of sugar prices by the Office
                                of Price Administration without consulting Cuba.</note> The
                            Department is convinced therefore that the Cuban Government should be
                            receptive to the proposal and will cooperate in every reasonable way to
                            assure orderly marketing of sugar during the emergency at equitable
                            prices.</p>
                        <p>This should prove a splendid opportunity for the Cuban Government and the
                            sugar industry to implement their assurances of cooperation. In this
                            connection it is the Department’s often repeated <pb n="238"
                                xml:id="pg_238" facs="0246"/>view that large volume production at
                            moderate prices is best for the Cuban economy on the long pull.</p>
                        <p>You should at the same time point out that the current trade-agreement
                                negotiations,<note n="57" xml:id="d186fn57">See <ref
                                    target="#pg_196">pp. 196</ref> ff.</note> although separate, are
                            in fact closely related to the purchase proposal; and emphasize again
                            the importance of early conclusion of the negotiations, on general
                            grounds, and in order to remove the uncertainty as to the duty on Cuban
                            sugar after January 1. Removal of this uncertainty would facilitate the
                            reaching of an agreement in regard to the purchase of the 1942 crop.
                            Also the early conclusion of the trade agreement would establish a
                            firmer foundation for future trade with the United States in sugar and
                            other products.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to the Department’s telegram No.
                            313, October 21, 7 p.m., and my despatch No. 2802 of October 23,<note
                                n="58" xml:id="d187fn58">Latter not printed.</note> I have the honor
                            to report that I handed to Dr. Cortina yesterday afternoon the
                            confidential memorandum (text accompanying despatch No. 2802) indicating
                            our Government’s interest in purchasing the entire 1942 sugar crop.</p>
                        <p>This information did not of course come altogether as a surprise to Dr.
                            Cortina, since there has been a good deal of speculation by the local
                            press in recent weeks concerning possible crop purchase proposals on the
                            part of our Government. The Minister said that he could not give me any
                            immediate official indication of the attitude of his Government, but
                            that he would at once inform the President and other interested Cuban
                            officials, and that he would let me have their preliminary views as soon
                            as possible.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the question of sending a Cuban representative to
                            Washington, Dr. Cortina inquired whether the purpose of the trip should
                            be held as confidential or whether it would be proper for his Government
                            to let our proposal be known. (Although it was left that the matter
                            would be held in confidence pending word from me, I anticipate that the
                            proposal will almost inevitably become known at an early date.)</p>
                        <p>Emphasizing that he was speaking in a personal rather than official vein,
                            Dr. Cortina then said that he doubted whether it would be <pb n="239"
                                xml:id="pg_239" facs="0247"/>desirable for his Government to sell
                            the entire crop at a fixed price. He explained that “since sugar is
                            money in Cuba, we have to use the dollars received for our sugar to buy
                            all our essential commodities—the majority of which are obtainable at
                            present only from the United States.” The Minister pointed out that more
                            than 90% of Cuba’s imports now come from the United States and that,
                            while Cuba wished to cooperate with us very closely in this matter as in
                            all others, he did not feel it would be fair for us to ask Cuba to sell
                            its 1942 <hi rend="italic">zafra</hi> at a fixed price, unless the
                            prices of Cuban imports could also be fixed, and on the same relative
                            level.</p>
                        <p>Although I made no comment to the Minister, I am strongly impressed by
                            the reasonableness of this point of view. It is quite true that at the
                            present time Cuba must buy practically everything from the United
                            States, and I do not believe it would either be equitable or in the long
                            run be advantageous to us to create a situation in which, having sold
                            her crop, Cuba would have no means of meeting rising prices for the
                            American products required by this country. In my opinion one solution
                            would be for the crop to be sold on some formula basis, rather than on a
                            fixed-price basis.</p>
                        <p>I made the informal suggestion to Dr. Cortina that while we should
                            welcome whatever representative his Government wished to send to
                            Washington, I thought it would be helpful for Dr. Mañas<note n="59"
                                xml:id="d187fn59">Arturo Manuel Mañas, representative of the Cuban

                            because of his ability and his intimate knowledge of the Cuban sugar
                            situation but also because of his understanding of our own Government. I
                            added that I thought it essential that an English-speaking
                            representative be sent. (I of course assume that Dr. Albertini<note
                                n="60" xml:id="d187fn60">Oscar Diaz Albertini, representative of the

                            available to assist the Cuban representative.)</p>

                        <p>Although it is now generally believed in sugar circles in Habana that the
                            purpose of the Commission’s trip is to discuss possible purchase of the
                            1942 crop, publicity in the Spanish language press in Habana continues
                            to show considerable restraint. (I enclose the pertinent clipping from
                            this morning’s <hi rend="italic">Diario de la Marina</hi>, which
                            likewise contains the Spanish text of the decree.) The <hi rend="italic"
                                >Havana Post</hi> has, however, made a sensational play of the
                            appointment of the Commission, which it reports under the caption “Sugar

                            I enclose the clipping.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Pierson<note n="64" xml:id="d189fn64">Warren Lee Pierson, President
                                of the Export-Import Bank of Washington.</note> called me on the
                            telephone at 11:30 today to say that they were having their troubles in
                            coming to agreement with the Cuban Sugar Commission on the purchase of
                            the 1942 crop. At the meeting yesterday, we had offered the Cubans what
                            was equivalent to 2.40 for sugar and 2.30 for 1,000,000 tons sugar
                            content molasses. He pointed out that the Price Comptroller had agreed
                            to raise the selling price of sugar from 3.50 to 3.64. This made it
                            possible to offer the Cubans 2.40 instead of the present 2.26 for sugar.
                            The Cubans had remained firm in asking 2.75 for sugar and molasses and
                            the meeting ended yesterday on that basis.</p>
                        <pb n="241" xml:id="pg_241" facs="0249"/>
                        <p>Mr. Pierson said that they had had a meeting with OPM<note n="65"
                                xml:id="d189fn65">Office of Production Management.</note> this
                            morning, which had just ended, and that OPM had indicated that it could
                            not pay a higher price than 2.30 net for molasses. OPM felt that by
                            rationing alcohol for use in gin and alcoholic beverages and by using
                            some 600,000,000 bushels of corn for alcohol, and certain other steps,
                            it could meet the needs without consummating this purchase of the Cuban
                            1942 crop.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Pierson said that in addition to asking 2.75 for sugar and molasses,
                            the Cubans had insisted that they be given corresponding benefit of any
                            increase-benefit-payments paid to American producers. This, he said, had
                            caused a bad impression among the representatives of Agriculture.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Pierson further said that our people had conducted the conversations
                            very fairly and had arrived at the conclusion that the Cubans were
                            assuming an unreasonable attitude.</p>
                        <p>I told Mr. Pierson that I hoped very much that some arrangement could be
                            arrived at. We had asked the Cubans to come up on this matter and the
                            initiative was ours. We had our relations with Cuba on a sounder and
                            firmer basis than we had had them for years and I feared very much that
                            failure to reach an agreement on this matter would have a very bad
                            effect and complicate our relationships. I pointed out that these
                            negotiations for the purchase of the 1942 crop were tied up with our
                            trade agreement negotiations which were also in a crucial stage, and
                            that these whole negotiations were particularly important, both for us
                            and for Cuba from the long-range point of view. I said that with regard
                            to the technical aspects of the sugar purchase, there were those who
                            knew so much more than I that I could not offer any helpful comment. I
                            did want to stress again the importance of the negotiation not failing
                            because of what I believed would be an inevitably undesirable effect on
                            our general relations which were so important.</p>
                        <p>In this connection, Mr. Pierson said that the negotiations were not being
                            broken up and it could not be said of them that they were a failure, but
                            that the Cubans would be returning “to report” and would have an
                            opportunity to reflect.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Pierson also said that he had had a conversation with Dr. Mañas this
                            morning in which he had informed him of the alternatives which we had
                            and could use, such as using corn for alcohol and rationing alcohol for
                            beverages. I told him that it was important to stress these factors with
                            the Cubans who perhaps were too strongly impressed with their belief of
                            our dependence upon them. I failed to mention it, but of course, in this
                            connection, I am sure that there <pb n="242" xml:id="pg_242" facs="0250"
                            />is being brought to the attention of the Cubans the possibility which
                            exists of some kind of agreement with the Japanese, as a result of which
                            Philippine sugars will continue to come into our market. These
                            alternative measures and sources should, I believe, be brought strongly
                            to the attention of the Cubans.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Pierson suggested the advisability of my seeing President Batista to
                            bring to his attention the possible results of failure of the
                            negotiations for the Cuban economy. I told Mr. Pierson that I had
                            already had this in mind and mentioned it to Mr. Walmsley<note n="66"
                                xml:id="d189fn66">Walter N. Walmsley, Jr., Assistant Chief of the
                                Division of the American Republics.</note> this morning. I also told
                            him that I had had a talk with Mr. Welles<note n="67" xml:id="d189fn67"
                                >Under Secretary of State Sumner Welles.</note> this morning in
                            which I expressed the hope that some arrangement would still be found in
                            view of our present and long-range relationships with Cuba. I said to
                            Mr. Pierson that I did not think I should see the President here until I
                            had more news from him and until I had some pertinent facts which could
                            be sent me by airmail or by cable.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Pierson said that the British had agreed for the present not to buy
                            any sugar except at present prices.</p>

                            a commitment. In order that no misunderstandings may arise you are
                            requested to secure from the Cuban Government a memorandum of acceptance
                            of the proposal set forth in the Department’s aforementioned telegram

                            instruction no. 1096 of December 11, 1941, you are requested to advise
                            the Department by telegram immediately that the Cuban Government has
                            indicated its very clear understanding that any adjustment in the price
                            ceiling of raw sugar which might be undertaken in anticipation of the
                            purchase agreement would be designed to carry out in advance the terms
                            of that agreement, and not for any other purpose.<note n="71"

                            I handed to Your Excellency and to the Secretary of the Presidency, Mr.
                            Amadeo López Castro, who was the head of the Commission of your
                            Government recently in Washington for the purpose of discussing the
                            purchase by my Government of the 1942 sugar crop of Cuba. In this
                            memorandum the Office of Price Administration of my Government stated
                            the proposed terms of purchase.</p>
                        <p>I am now informed by my Government that the Office of Price
                            Administration has confirmed the proposed terms, which may now be
                            considered as a definite offer of my Government. In order that no
                            misunderstandings may arise, I am requested to secure from Your
                            Excellency’s Government a memorandum of acceptance of the proposal set
                            forth in the memorandum of December 2, 1941, above referred to.</p>
                        <p>My Government informs me that on December 7, by agreement between the
                            Department of Agriculture and the Office of Price Administration, orders
                            were issued freezing the price for refined sugar and providing that
                            sugar refineries should deliver to customers only for their immediate
                            needs, for the purpose of nullifying insofar as possible the effects of
                            possible war hysteria on the market. This action, the Office of Price
                            Administration advises, is intended to be only a temporary measure. For
                            this and for other reasons, it may become desirable or necessary,
                            despite the refined freezing order, to raise the domestic ceiling on raw
                            sugar prior to the conclusion of the agreement for the purchase of the
                            Cuban 1942 crop. As Your Excellency knows, the conclusion of the
                            purchase agreement has also been somewhat delayed through the necessary
                            steps involved in the negotiation of the Supplementary Trade Agreement
                            between our two Governments. It therefore becomes necessary that the
                            interested agencies of my Government be informed of the acceptance of
                            the proposed terms for the purchasing arrangement before formal
                            conclusion of the arrangement occurs, and in that case my Government
                            will appreciate an indication from the Cuban Government of its perfect
                            understanding that any such price ceiling adjustment of raw <pb n="246"
                                xml:id="pg_246" facs="0254"/>sugar which might be undertaken in
                            anticipation of the purchase agreement would be designed to carry out in
                            advance the terms of that agreement and would not be for any other
                            purpose.</p>

                                basic minimum prices mentioned in the proposal were not satisfactory
                                from a strictly commercial view point considering the increases

                        <p>With respect to the exchange of notes the Embassy’s task was facilitated
                            by an assurance received by telephone from Dr. Joshua Bernhardt of the
                            Department of Agriculture last evening that a footnote would be inserted
                            at the appropriate point in the Department of Agriculture’s sugar
                            statistics to the effect that Cuba had, at the request of and in
                            cooperation with the Government of the United States, produced . . . . .
                            gallons of invert in lieu of raw sugar which, by sugar content, would
                            have been the equivalent of . . . . . tons of sugar. Mr. Mersereau who
                            obtained the foregoing assurance from Dr. Bernhardt, is confirming it by
                            a letter to the Institute on behalf of Defense Supplies Corporation, a
                            copy of which will be transmitted to the Department in due course. The
                            foregoing was accepted by Sr. López Castro in lieu of the inclusion of
                            the clause “and that for statistical purposes the molasses shipped to
                            the United States by Cuba in 1942 be treated as sugar.”</p>

                            connection with the purchase of Cuba’s 1942 sugar crop was effected as
                            of yesterday’s date. The texts are identical with those accompanying my
                            despatch No. 3348 of January 28 with the exception of the deletion from
                            my note in reply of the sentence, “nothing in this or any other

                        <p>With reference to my conversation with Mr. Hawkins on January 28 in which
                            I explained the views of Dr. Cortina concerning the deletion of this
                            sentence, I enclose a rather detailed memorandum for our records,
                            setting forth all the attendant circumstances.<note n="82"
                                xml:id="d195fn82">Memorandum not printed; Minister of State Cortina
                                conceded that the United States had a right to reduce duties but, he
                                contended, an agreement for the sale of the sugar crop was not the
                                place for a provision with respect to duties.</note> In my opinion
                            this will avoid any possible misunderstanding concerning the point of
                            view of the Minister of State in desiring to have the sentence in
                            question removed from the text. I am likewise of the belief that this

                            that of the other Cuban officials, adequately protects our position on
                            this duty-reduction question.</p>

                                xml:id="d198fn3">Julio Tobar Donoso.</note> which is attached

                            to the recent statements in the Peruvian press of Dr. Ulloa, former
                            Foreign Minister of Peru, alleging that Ecuador was negotiating a
                            concession of the Galápagos Islands to the United States.</p>
                        <p>I asked the Ambassador to let Dr. Tobar know that I myself was greatly
                            astonished by these statements of Dr. Ulloa whom I had known for many
                            years. Obviously, I said, the statements were utterly without
                            foundation, and as a personal friend of Dr. Ulloa, I regretted that he
                            had made these statements without availing himself of the many
                            opportunities presented to assure himself that the reports to which he
                            had given credence were utterly without foundation.</p>

                        <p>Colonel W. K. Burgess, Chief of our Air Mission here,<note n="7"
                                xml:id="d199fn7">An agreement between the United States and Ecuador
                                for a military aviation mission was signed on December 12, 1940;
                                Department of State Executive Agreement Series No. 189, or 54 Stat.

                            this report deals merely with urgent items.</p>
                        <p>Ecuadoran aviators, grounded since the Fall of 1939, have no planes in
                            which to fly. Last Spring, after General Dargue<note n="8"
                                xml:id="d199fn8">Brig. Gen. H. A. Dargue of the Air Corps.</note>
                            and Colonel Brady<note n="9" xml:id="d199fn9">Lt. Col. Francis M.
                                Brady.</note> visited Ecuador, this Government sent five old basic
                            trainer engines to Patterson for overhaul. These engines, presumably in
                            perfect condition, returned to Guayaquil on February 23. Colonel
                            Burgess’s report contains a statement that if a few mechanics can be
                            borrowed from the Canal Zone they should be able to recondition some of
                            the airplanes and fit the BT engines therein so that basic trainers
                            might be available for refresher service for a few Ecuadoran pilots.
                            Major Paez, Chief of the Ecuadoran Army Air Corps, has, through Colonel
                            Burgess, requested the loan of the mechanics from Panama, offering to
                            pay their board and keep during their sojourn in this country,
                            presumably at Guayaquil.</p>
                        <p>Colonel Burgess likewise recommends the repair of six primary trainers,
                            the engines for which have already been sent to Patterson, N. J. for
                            overhaul. Presumably this will require about four months. Meanwhile, it
                            will be necessary to order spare parts to fix up the planes—also some
                            material for a repair shop, the total cost, after considerable revision
                            downward (for necessary items), to keep the old planes, once
                            re-habilitated, going for about a year or a year and a half, will be
                            $57,000.</p>
                        <p>Guayaquil, where training was formerly given, has been the scene of many
                            disasters—due, in large part, to a lack of emergency landing places. For
                            physiological and other reasons, Colonel Burgess has recommended that
                            primary aviation training be given at Salinas; advanced training at
                            Quito. This means that two small training schools will need to be
                            constructed. Colonel Burgess’s report included the plans. The estimated
                            cost of the school for Salinas is roughly $12,000; that for Quito about
                            $18,000. Both, according to the figures he has received, can be finished
                            for approximately $30,000.</p>
                        <p>Taking the item given above for reconditioning old planes of $57,000; add
                            to it $30,000, and the result is $87,000. It is respectfully suggested
                            the Air Mission have made available to it at least $100,000 pending the
                            arrangement of a larger credit which presumably <pb n="260"
                                xml:id="pg_260" facs="0268"/>will be the subject of discussion
                            between the two Governments and consequently may be delayed for some
                            time.</p>
                        <p>It is presumed that upon receipt of information to the effect that this
                            credit will become available, Colonel Burgess could immediately begin
                            construction of the plants at Salinas and Quito. The moral effect of
                            seeing work started, added to the ability of Ecuadoran aviators to fly,
                            as they can do in the very near future if we lend mechanics to help fix
                            up the planes, will produce an excellent effect in this country.</p>
                        <p>The Panagra<note n="13" xml:id="d199fn13">Pan American-Grace
                                Airways.</note> plane which left here this morning carried an air
                            express package addressed to Colonel A. E. Harris, G–2, War Department,
                            containing the exhibits to Colonel Burgess’s plan, carbon copies of
                            which, along with two letters from Colonel Burgess to Colonel Harris,
                            went air mail. Thus, the Foreign Relations Section of the War Department
                            should be in possession of a copy of Colonel Burgess’s report, also his
                            request for a loan of the mechanics and his recommendation that
                            provisional credit be granted.</p>
                        <p>I concur in the advisability of quickly arranging such a credit and of
                            doing anything else, within the power of our Government, to facilitate
                            accomplishments for its Air Mission in Ecuador.</p>

                            information of the Ecuadoran Ambassador in preparing a request to the
                            President of the United States for the transfer of the two vessels under
                            the provisions of Public Law 11.<note n="15" xml:id="d200fn15">The
                                Lend-Lease Act of March 11, 1941; 55 Stat. 31.</note></p>
                        <p>It is noted that the Government of Ecuador not only desires to acquire
                            the two vessels, but also desires that a sufficient number of United
                            States Naval personnel remain on board the vessels, after they have been
                            transferred, to train and instruct the crew in the operation and upkeep
                            of the vessels.</p>
                        <pb n="261" xml:id="pg_261" facs="0269"/>
                        <p>It is also noted that, at present, Ecuador possesses practically no Naval
                            resources and it is apparent that, unless a small Naval Base, capable of
                            making minor repairs, can be obtained by Ecuador, the ships transferred
                            will deteriorate rapidly.</p>
                        <p>The proposed agreement, therefore, has been prepared not only to cover
                            the details of the transfer of the vessels and the status of the United
                            States Naval personnel remaining on board, but also for the acquisition
                            of a small Naval Base for the operation and upkeep of the vessels
                            transferred.</p>

                        <p>Captain Alfaro called this afternoon and read the text of the proposed
                            agreement for the transfer of naval vessels and of the letter<note
                                n="16" xml:id="d201fn16">Neither printed.</note> which he will
                            address to the President transmitting his Government’s request. He said
                            that he perceived no objection to either one, and asked for three copies
                            in order to inform his Government. I took the occasion to point out to
                            him that in order to operate the vessels after they had been turned over
                            to the Ecuadoran Government, funds would be required which could not be
                            provided under the Lend-Lease Act, and that it would consequently be
                            necessary to give consideration to this matter.</p>
                        <p>Captain Alfaro seemed surprised that the construction of the naval base
                            was included in the proposed agreement, as in his correspondence with
                            the President of Ecuador the latter had only referred to the acquisition
                            of the two boats. He added, however, that the President would in all
                            probability consent to the inclusion of the naval base.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador also inquired whether this matter could not be made public
                            on May 4. I replied that I would convey his inquiry to the appropriate
                            officials of the Department.</p>

                            constructive steps be taken looking to the establishment of a small
                            Ecuadoran aviation group. Last year we succeeded in eliminating Italian
                            aviation instruction, and this year we hope to see the German aviation
                            company out of Ecuador.<note n="19" xml:id="d204fn19">See <ref
                                    target="#pg_270">pp. 270</ref> ff.</note></p>
                        <p>Before the aviation members of the Italian Military Mission to Ecuador
                            were sent back to Italy (1940), it had been tentatively understood that
                            an American Aviation Mission would proceed to Ecuador. However, Ecuador
                            opportunely made perfectly clear that her economic position was steadily
                            growing worse, which prevented the making of payments as other nations
                            do; hence, Ecuador asked for advance assurances that she would receive
                            assistance—a million dollars being suggested as a tentative fund. The
                            President of Ecuador called our Minister before his entire Cabinet,
                            explained that he desired to be relieved of embarrassment by having the
                            United States Government know in advance of Ecuador’s economic distress
                            so that he (the President of Ecuador) would not be made uncomfortable by
                            having our Chief of Aviation Mission come to Quito, make plans and ask
                            for funds which Ecuador could not deliver simply because she lacked
                            money and knew no source from which it might be obtained save through
                            collaboration with us, which he desired to perfect.</p>
                        <p>In reply, the Department of State indicated that setting up such a fund
                            for Ecuador would be premature as other American republics had not then
                            stated what their requirements would be. Even so, we did say that, after
                            the Chief of our Aviation Mission had reached Ecuador and made
                            recommendations in which Ecuador concurred, methods for implementing
                            them would receive attention. Compliance on our part is now in order,
                            since Ecuador expected and expects that in some manner, not precisely
                            specified but more or less as outlined by Colonel Burgess, we will help
                            to put her experienced aviators back in the air and also train some new
                            ones. Her experienced aviators are now practically grounded for lack of
                            adequate planes, spare parts to recondition Ecuador’s old planes, a shop
                            under proper mechanical direction for maintenance, and the other things
                            which go with supporting a small air force.</p>

                        <p>Prior also to concluding the arrangements for the establishment of
                            Panagra in Ecuador (as a local operation) that country pointed out the
                            double nature of Sedta<note n="20" xml:id="d204fn20">Sociedad
                                Ecuatoriana de Transportes Aéreos, German-controlled commercial air

                            Ecuador sought to oblige Panagra to undertake both, but for obvious
                            reasons Panagra declined those of a military character.</p>
                        <p>Thereupon Ecuador was reminded that the revival of her own Aviation
                            Corps, under our aviation direction, might enable them to perform their
                            own military services, that is, take over from Sedta. These services
                            consisted of transporting border guards, coast guards, troops and
                            officers, including Cabinet members and occasionally the President,
                            about Ecuador. The burden of these services would not be great. Also,
                            Ecuador is said to have several experienced pilots who should in a
                            comparatively short time be enabled to take over, with our aid. In this
                            connection intimation was made that we might assist Ecuador in financing
                            the acquisition of one or two hydro planes or amphibians for the
                            “Oriente service” provided Ecuador would refrain from closing a contract
                            with Sedta, the German company which precisely at that moment was
                            seeking a contract for the entire Oriente service of about 80 flights
                            per year for a million sucres (roughly $66,666.66 US dollars)—a low
                            price.</p>
                        <p>Sedta transported some Ecuadorans free, others for a minimum fee, but the
                            rates are being made progressively lower since Panagra set up its local
                            service.</p>
                        <p>Panagra entered Ecuador with the understanding that her former rates
                            would be brought down to those of Sedta as of a given date. Yet the
                            moment Panagra got into operation (internal services within Ecuador),
                            Sedta cut prices.</p>
                        <p>Our assurances to help Ecuador in the development of their own military
                            aviation on a limited scale were given prior to Ecuador’s indication
                            that she would assist in the elimination of Sedta.</p>
                        <p>It would seem that the proper procedure would be for funds to be made
                            available now for the aviation schools and the things necessary to their
                            success. A quarter of a million dollars should suffice (see attached
                            memorandum “A” or letter from War<note n="21" xml:id="d204fn21">Not
                                attached to file copy.</note> which shows that Department has no
                            money for such purposes).</p>
                        <p>When available the funds might be turned over to our Aviation Mission to
                            do the necessary things, or they might be passed along to Panagra to do
                            certain portions of the work in Ecuador. In the order of importance, the
                            steps appear to be as follows:</p>

                            another officer from here reaches Ecuador, in giving instruction with

                        <p>240. The Navy Department has informed the Department that it considers it
                            essential to increase its patrol activities owing to the presence of
                            raiders in the Pacific. It desires, therefore, to ascertain if the
                            Government of Ecuador would consent to grant blanket permission for
                            ships of the United States Navy engaged in patrol duties to use the
                            ports of the Galápagos Islands and Guayaquil in order to obtain fuel and
                            supplies. In addition, the Navy Department would also desire to send
                            tankers and tenders into these ports. The naval vessels would obtain
                            fuel and supplies from these tankers and tenders when not obtainable
                            through local purchase. Should such permission be accorded, instructions
                            would, of course, be issued to the commanding officers of the vessels
                            concerned to inform the Consulate at Guayaquil as far in advance as
                            practicable in order that the latter may notify the appropriate
                            Ecuadoran officials.</p>
                        <p>In order to enable the Department to determine whether to present a
                            formal request, you will please, provided you perceive no objection,
                            consult discreetly and informally the appropriate authorities of the
                            Government to which you are accredited in order to obtain an expression
                            of their opinion. The Department would also appreciate a statement of
                            your own views on this subject. Although, in the plan outlined above,
                            the present practice of informing the Foreign Office of naval visits via
                            the Legation would be abandoned, the Department is confident that the
                            Ecuadoran Government will fully realize the importance of these patrol
                            activities in the interest of hemisphere defense.</p>

                            convenience the negotiations be conducted here. The Ambassador asked if

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In amplification of my despatch No. 1360
                                [<hi rend="italic">1630</hi>] of February 17,<note n="42"
                                xml:id="d215fn42">Not printed.</note> I have the honor to report
                            that an employee of Panagra advised me about noon yesterday that his
                            company had received a query from the Minister of National Defense as to
                            whether it could purchase or take over 400 drums of aviation gasoline
                            which have been stored at Guayaquil since the Fall of 1939.</p>
                        <p>The local Panagra office first had the idea of inquiring as to the
                            specifications of this gasoline, feeling quite sure that it was 87
                            octane, which Panagra could not use. About 3 p.m. I was advised that
                            Panagra would probably answer the Minister of National Defense, saying
                            that it would purchase the gasoline. This sudden change of front was due
                            to a rumor that Sedta had already received an authorization from the
                            Ecuadoran Government to take over the entire 400 drums.</p>
                        <p>Late last week Sedta revised its schedule downward to make fewer trips,
                            for “technical reasons”. At the post office inquirers were advised that
                            a shortage of gasoline prevented Sedta from making its usual trips. A
                            representative of Panagra asserted that friends from Guayaquil advised
                            that Sedta had only a few drums of gasoline left. Other sources
                            indicated that Sedta’s March quota of 150 drums could not be delivered
                            from Talara until about March 3.</p>
                        <p>Yesterday afternoon advice reached us that Major Paez, Acting Chief of
                            the Ecuadoran Air Corps, had given the Government order turning over to
                            Sedta the 400 drums of old aviation gasoline stored at Guayaquil.</p>
                        <pb n="272" xml:id="pg_272" facs="0280"/>
                        <p>The resident diplomatic agent of Panagra advised me this morning that he
                            had sent an air mail communication to Mr. Gustavo Vidal, Panagra Vice
                            President, at New York by plane leaving February 17 at 2 p.m., to the
                            effect that Sedta has now applied for permission to utilize all
                            facilities being installed by Panagra, namely, airports, hangars,
                            offices, and so forth. There has been no time to confirm this latest
                            move of Sedta but past experience shows that aggressive steps will be
                            taken by them.</p>
                        <p>Rumor has it today that the next move will be to provide the Ministry of
                            National Defense with airplane service to the Oriente. However, it is
                            felt that this may be an exaggeration since the presence here of our
                            Aviation Mission suggests that eventually progress will be made and
                            steps be taken to equip Ecuadoran Army fliers to render the Oriente

                        <p>This office would appreciate being informed as to the approximate date
                            when Panagra may receive the delivery of new planes which will release
                            one or more of the old DC–2’s for service in Ecuador. It would likewise
                            be appreciated if we might be advised as to approximately how long it
                            would take to supply the civilian instructors and the hydroplanes
                            necessary to render the Oriente service. This information may be of use
                            in blocking further contracts by Sedta.</p>
                        <p>This morning I mentioned to Dr. Tobar<note n="45" xml:id="d215fn45">Julio
                                Tobar Donoso, Ecuadoran Minister for Foreign Affairs.</note> that
                            Major Paez was understood to have authorized Sedta to make use of the
                            400 drums of aviation gasoline at Guayaquil and observed that this was a
                            supply sufficient to run Sedta for two and a half months. I said that I
                            had gathered the impression from the President some weeks ago when
                            handing him the autographed letter from President Roosevelt that it was
                            not then the intention of the Ecuadoran Government to lend gasoline to
                            Sedta. Dr. Tobar said he was not informed but that in his personal
                            opinion it was obviously desirable that thought be given to the
                            realization of the objectives sought as soon as Panagra was in a
                            position to render a full internal service.</p>

                            attorney, Dr. Catón Cárdenas by Mr. Gustavo Vidal with regard to the
                            elimination of Sedta.</p>
                        <p>I am informed by Colonel Flores Guerra<note n="48" xml:id="d217fn48"
                                >Panagra’s local representative in Ecuador.</note> that when Dr.
                            Cárdenas discussed this subject with the President, offering Panagra’s
                            cooperation to buy out Sedta, President Arroyo expressed his
                            appreciation and said that would not be necessary as the continuance of
                            that company in operation in Ecuador was dependent on the attitude of
                            the International Petroleum Company<note n="49" xml:id="d217fn49">Of
                                Toronto, Canada.</note> in continuing to supply it with gasoline. I
                            understand that the President expressed the view that as soon as this
                            gasoline supply is cut off, the company will necessarily have to suspend
                            operations and there will be no necessity for any action on the part of
                            the Government. When asked if he felt that the company might demand an
                            indemnity from the Government, he replied that, on the contrary, the
                            Government would be in a position to demand reimbursement of part of the
                            800,000 sucres subsidy which had been given the company.</p>
                        <p>Colonel Flores Guerra believes that the Government would be pleased to
                            see Sedta’s gasoline supply cut off as this would relieve it of the
                            responsibility of taking any steps in the matter. It is his opinion,
                            based on statements of the President, that the Government would <pb
                                n="274" xml:id="pg_274" facs="0282"/>be extremely reluctant to
                            cancel the Sedta contract as it would establish an unfortunate precedent
                            in the Government’s relations with other foreign companies operating
                            under concessions with the Ecuadoran Government.</p>
                        <p>Sedta is committed to return to the Ecuadoran Government on April 15 the
                            200 drums of gasoline which it borrowed from the Air Corps supply. It is
                            believed that the company will not be in a position to comply with this
                            obligation, which may offer a justification for some action on the part
                            of the Government.</p>
                        <p>I am hopeful that as soon as Sedta’s operations are suspended because of
                            shortage of gasoline, the Government will feel justified in ordering the
                            company to liquidate on grounds of non-compliance with its operating
                            contract. It would not be satisfactory from our point of view for the
                            company merely to cease flying operations if it were to continue to
                            maintain offices and radio stations in the various cities which it
                            serves in Ecuador. As soon as the occasion appears to be opportune, I
                            shall bring these considerations to the attention of the Ecuadoran
                            authorities.</p>
                        <p>I consider that the situation is developing satisfactorily and that it
                            may not be over optimistic to hope that Sedta’s days are numbered.</p>

                            Department’s telegram No. 63 of April 19, 4 p.m., with regard to the
                            suspension of sales of aviation gasoline to Sedta by the International
                            Petroleum Company.</p>
                        <pb n="275" xml:id="pg_275" facs="0283"/>
                        <p>On May 3 the International Petroleum Company informed its Ecuadoran
                            representative, Mr. Raul Cucalón, that no further deliveries would be
                            made to Sedta in view of instructions received from the Government of
                            Canada. This information was apparently transmitted to Sedta and has
                            been published in local newspapers. One article reported a statement by
                            the Sedta office that it was aware of the suspension of future sales by
                            the International Petroleum Company, but that it had made arrangements
                            to obtain gasoline from other sources. The Sedta office indicated that
                            its traffic in Ecuador would not be interrupted.</p>
                        <p>In recent conversations with the Minister of Foreign Affairs I have
                            informally brought up the question of the elimination of Sedta. He has
                            consistently replied that this could readily be accomplished by shutting
                            off sales of aviation gasoline from Peru. The Department will also
                            recall that President Arroyo del Río indicated to a Panagra
                            representative that this was the logical way to eliminate Sedta. While
                            neither of these officials has indicated that they would not be disposed
                            to seek other means for the elimination of Sedta in the event that the
                            shutting off of gasoline supplies does not prove effective, there is no
                            doubt in my mind that our objective will be greatly facilitated if that
                            company is obliged to suspend or reduce its services for lack of
                            fuel.</p>
                        <p>The statement of the Sedta office that it has made arrangements to obtain
                            gasoline from other sources is probably largely bluff. However, it is
                            not impossible that they may have uncovered some source of supply of
                            which we are not aware. The first possibility which occurs to me is
                            Japan. Japanese vessels call in Ecuador from time to time, and if
                            sufficient pressure from Germany were applied it is not inconceivable
                            that Japan might be willing to supply the few hundred drums per month
                            which would be adequate to permit Sedta to operate its full schedule. I
                            understand that strenuous efforts have been made by the company to
                            obtain gasoline from Argentina. I am not acquainted with the precise
                            situation of the refineries there, but it occurs to me that if they are
                            dependent for the manufacture of high-test gasoline on American supplies
                            of Ethyl compound, we might be disposed to indicate that shipments of
                            gasoline either directly or indirectly to Sedta might prejudice the
                            likelihood of obtaining export licenses for future shipments of Ethyl
                            compounds.</p>
                        <p>I assume that all American manufacturers of high-test gasoline including
                            those operating refineries in Aruba or other parts of South America have
                            been apprized of the situation and will under no circumstances permit
                            sales to Sedta. It might be well also to warn these companies to be
                            alert for any orders for aviation gasoline from new or unknown
                            customers, as Sedta might endeavor to have supplies <pb n="276"
                                xml:id="pg_276" facs="0284"/>released to a dummy, either in Ecuador
                            or some other country, for subsequent resale to it.</p>
                        <p>I do not doubt that these possibilities have occurred to the Department
                            and may have already received its consideration. In any event, I desire
                            to emphasize that the question of the supply of aviation gasoline is the
                            crux of the situation, and we should not overlook any possible source of
                            supply which it is within our power to cut off.</p>

                        <p>95. Reference Department’s telegram No. 84, May 22, 8 p.m. In my despatch
                            1801 of today’s date,<note n="51" xml:id="d221fn51">Not printed.</note>
                            leaving here in tomorrow’s pouch, I report that under instructions from
                            Lima the local Panagra representative informed the President yesterday
                            that arrangements to eliminate Quito had been concluded and that the
                            President had accepted this decision, but expressed the opinion that
                            this action will cause criticism of Panagra.</p>
                        <p>While I am not informed of the importance to Panagra of eliminating Quito
                            at once it would certainly be desirable to defer this, if possible until
                            the situation with respect to Sedta is clarified. If the 1-day service
                            between the Canal Zone and Lima is to be inaugurated in the near future
                            the elimination of Quito should preferably be deferred until that time.
                            The action should be preceded by a careful preparation of public
                            opinion.</p>

                            the suppression of Sedta, I am confident that there will be a violent
                            anti-Panagra campaign, particularly in the pro-Nazi press.</p>

                            long conversation last Sunday evening with President Arroyo he stated
                            that Sedta had been encountering difficulties during May and June in
                            continuing operations and was using automobile fuel part of the time
                            instead of aviation gas. Had this condition continued a few weeks
                            longer, he thought Sedta might have suspended.</p>

                            Lisbon. President Arroyo says he has refused to consider the offer at
                            the moment.</p>
                        <p>He added that eliminating Quito from international schedules at this
                            moment might release public opinion against Panagra but asserted he was
                            anxious to see Sedta out whenever Panagra would render the same
                            services.</p>
                        <p>He recommended the following: first, relieve Panagra internal services in
                            Ecuador from having to consult Lima regarding domestic passengers, then
                            have Panagra carry airmail within Ecuador at the <pb n="278"
                                xml:id="pg_278" facs="0286"/>same rate as Sedta. Once agreed, he
                            would cancel the airmail part of the Sedta contract—which would leave
                            them only passengers, and shortly thereafter a campaign would be started
                            pointing out the dangers of flying with automobile gasoline, which he
                            thought might be the end of Sedta.</p>
                        <p>I asked if he was not disposed to make certain the elimination by
                            confiscating Sedta and buying the two Junkers. He replied, “Not at this
                            instant, as the Army is depending upon them for transport; moreover,
                            considering the new grip Sedta feels she has on the public sentiment,
                            she would probably refuse—just now. However, should peace continue with
                            Peru and Panagra regain some of its lost favour through the elimination
                            of the need to consult Lima as to movements of passengers within
                            Ecuador, also to replace Sedta as to handling airmail, conditions might
                            be different.” Arroyo thought it might not take long to remould public
                            sentiment, though there was an underlying apprehension in the minds of
                            many Ecuadorans that once Sedta had been eliminated Panagra would reduce
                            its domestic services.</p>
                        <p>The President observed that acquiring the Junkers with the idea that
                            Ecuadoran fliers could operate them was fraught with risk, as our
                            Aviation Mission had not given sufficient refresher instruction. Such a
                            step would not be safe. Moreover, spare parts would be a problem. If
                            there was any thought of taking over the Junkers on the expectation
                            that, in the hands of comparatively inexperienced Ecuadorans, they would
                            render efficient service to the Army, he was dubious. Thus it became a
                            technical question, and it might be better to go back to the civilian
                            pilots and two American planes idea—as offered by us a year ago—if
                            Panagra could not render all the service.</p>
                        <p>This brings us back to the same old circle. Panagra is possibly right in
                            declining to render aviation services that are likely to run it into
                            difficulties. When they made this crystal clear during negotiations last
                            year, our Government, in an effort to defeat Sedta’s proposals, offered
                            to finance the acquisition of two amphibians or hydroplanes and the
                            salaries of two American civilian instructors for the Oriente or

                                p.m.,<note n="55" xml:id="d223fn55">Not printed.</note> gives the
                            more important points. Amplifications appear below.</p>
                        <p>The Germans operating Sedta, in addition to asking 1500 liters of
                            aviation gasoline per hour while flying for account of the Army, also
                            wished insurance should their pilots, auxiliary personnel, or planes be
                            shot down, also some type of additional compensation to care for the
                            bodies and/or families of personnel wounded or killed in the line of
                            duty.</p>
                        <p>Ecuadorans, should they confiscate Sedta under a wave of patriotic
                            inspiration, might find it quite difficult to operate efficiently even
                            the two Junkers planes now here. Sedta has a manager, a diplomatic
                            contact man (propagandist), excellent pilots, quite a number of
                            mechanics, efficient radio service, and satisfactory ground crews.
                            Together they have for many months rendered a dependable service and,
                            even in the face of scant aviation gas supplies, have kept going, albeit
                            at considerable risk when fuel stocks were low.</p>
                        <p>The simple fact that a few Ecuadoran pilots can fly the rebuilt Basic
                            Trainers of ’36 vintage from Guayaquil to nearby airports and get back
                            alive—this without proper radio or instruments—is not proof acceptable
                            to some Ecuadorans that they could intelligently handle the present
                            Sedta system, if confiscated.</p>
                        <p>In this connection, it has been recalled that the aviation history of
                            Ecuador is filled with too many deaths, and a repetition of past
                            tragedies at this time might react most unfavorably in the public mind,
                            and reflect upon the Administration which caused Ecuadorans to assume
                            the responsibility before its aviators were fully prepared, without
                            sufficient foreign technical guidance.</p>
                        <p>Now that eliminating Sedta has again been raised, it should be
                            pressed.</p>
                        <p>Respectfully yours,</p>

                            Department has conferred with officials of the Post Office Department
                            regarding the carrying of mail by Panagra at a rate equal to the present
                            rate charged by Sedta. In concurring with the Department’s position in
                            this matter the Post Office Department immediately discussed the
                            question with Roig of <pb n="280" xml:id="pg_280" facs="0288"
                                />Panagra<note n="58" xml:id="d224fn58">H. J. Roig, president of Pan
                                American-Grace Airways.</note> with the result that they have
                            authorized Panagra to put the reduction into effect whenever you
                            consider it advisable to do so.</p>
                        <p>In this regard the Department has been requested by Roig to weigh the
                            advisability of endeavoring to obtain on behalf of Panagra an exclusive
                            mail contract which will extend for a period of 5 years and preclude the
                            issuance of mail contracts to any other air carrier in Ecuador. In view
                            of the unusual extent of this concession by Panagra and the possible
                            financial risks involved therein the Department is inclined to feel that
                            it would be equitable to make this proposal to the Ecuadoran Government.
                            The 5–year period would, however, be without prejudice to the
                            possibility of mail contract being taken over in meantime by a national
                            Ecuadoran company if one is organized.</p>
                        <p>For your information a definite refusal by Ecuadoran Government to grant
                            the exclusive 5-year concession mentioned would not cause Panagra to
                            decline to carry the mail at the present Sedta rate.</p>
                        <p>Since the mail concession appears to be an important part of the general
                            plan which Morgan<note n="59" xml:id="d224fn59">Stokeley Morgan,

                            that he would cancel Sedta mail contract with 8 days’ notice upon
                            Panagra agreement to carry mails at Sedta rate. He would then study best
                            method of canceling operating concession and taking over Sedta assets.

                            law might require very large expenditure. Might possibly be able to
                            cancel franchise for failure to live up to obligations. He asked me to
                            submit a definite plan at the next conference. Please advise (1) whether
                            you would be satisfied for the present with cancellation only, (2)

                            Stokeley Morgan and I had a brief interview with the Minister for

                        <p>Mr. Morgan has not been able to see the President since August 13 and is
                            naturally somewhat discouraged as it becomes more and more apparent that
                            the President has been unable to make up his mind what action, if any,
                            he is prepared to take looking towards the elimination of Sedta.</p>
                        <p>I am in hopes that there will be a change in the situation within the
                            next two or three days and that the President will decide upon a policy
                            which will permit Mr. Morgan to enter upon the loan negotiations which
                            are the object of his visit. …</p>

                        <p>263. For Clayton from Morgan.</p>
                        <p>“The President this morning informed the American Minister and myself
                            that the Government would immediately order Sedta to discontinue
                            operations, basing this action upon the failure of the company to
                            maintain adequate standards of safety. The Government will then make
                            Sedta an offer for all its stock at a reasonable price and if the offer
                            is not accepted would proceed to expropriate. Panagra must be prepared
                            to carry all the mail immediately.</p>
                        <p>The President … said that if existing services are curtailed the public
                            reaction will be very severe and highly unfavorable not only to the
                            Government but also to the United States and to Panagra. I hope you can
                            advise me without delay that means will be found to increase Panagra
                            domestic services within Ecuador either by sending one more plane and
                            crew or by sending additional pilots to increase frequencies with
                            present equipment. The President expressed the opinion that Sedta
                            airplanes would not be found usable when taken over.”</p>

                        <p>287. In a long conference yesterday on Sedta the Foreign Minister sought
                            to bind Morgan and me with a promise for immediate arrival <pb n="283"
                                xml:id="pg_283" facs="0291"/>of another plane or two, or an oral
                            commitment covering an immediate increase in Panagra internal services.
                            We told him that we were doing our best and thought that the matter
                            could be worked out.</p>
                        <p>He then asked me to send him a note confirming my indications that
                            $275,000 is to become available for aviation training (Legation’s
                            telegram no. 270, August 28, 2 p.m.<note n="66" xml:id="d230fn66">Not
                                printed.</note>). I replied that I was awaiting detailed information
                            and would advise him later. Please instruct.</p>
                        <p>Later in the day the Foreign Minister explained that when Sedta ceased
                            operation we might expect considerable adverse propaganda, unless
                            Panagra would immediately satisfy the demand for air transportation. He
                            emphasized the need of doing something now rather than in a few weeks. I
                            believe it advisable to lend an extra plane here at least for a short
                            time to take care of the situation resulting from the elimination of
                            Sedta.</p>

                        <p>235. Your 287, September 4. As you know, this Government arrived at a
                            clear and definite arrangement with the Government of Ecuador with
                            respect to the elimination of Sedta. Under this arrangement this
                            Government had certain obligations. These obligations have all more than
                            fully been complied with. The Department is informed that Panagra is now
                            providing, and for some time in the past has provided, a service
                            superior to that performed by Sedta at the time that this arrangement
                            was entered into. Ecuador, therefore, has no ground under the agreement
                            for requesting concessions other than those contemplated in the
                            agreement and it is therefore expected that Ecuador will eliminate and
                            assist in the complete liquidation of Sedta without conditioning such
                            action on additional service, airplanes or expenditures for aviation
                            training.</p>
                        <p>It is unnecessary to recall to the Legation the various types of
                            assistance to Ecuador which this Government has rendered during recent
                            months. This assistance was freely offered by this Government without
                            being conditioned on the performance of any action by Ecuador, and was
                            rendered as part of a program designed not only to help Ecuador to
                            develop its internal economy but also to permit Ecuador to play its
                            appropriate role in hemisphere solidarity and defense. Our two
                            governments agreed that one important step to be taken in connection
                            with hemisphere defense was the prompt elimination of Sedta. It <pb
                                n="284" xml:id="pg_284" facs="0292"/>is only by the effective
                            performance by each of the 21 American Republics of its share in
                            responsibilities for hemisphere defense that the American Republics can
                            feel secure.</p>
                        <p>This Government of course does not overlook the fact that Ecuador is
                            passing through an extremely difficult period in its history and that it
                            has enormous political problems to contend with. This Government is
                            equally aware of the desire of Ecuador to develop and improve air
                            transportation. It is therefore prepared, provided always that Sedta is
                            eliminated, to assist in supplying airplanes and technicians for a
                            service consonant with Ecuador’s needs and based on a careful survey to
                            be made by Hardin<note n="67" xml:id="d231fn67">Thomas Hardin, Technical

                            Agency.</note></p>
                        <p>The $275,000 for aviation training became available September 5; it will
                            be expended by the Chief of the Air Mission in Ecuador and all
                            expenditures will be supervised by you. …</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that late this
                            evening I had a visit with President Arroyo del Rio. I explained that I
                            had gathered the impression, as a result of preliminary conversations
                            between Colonel Urrutia<note n="77" xml:id="d238fn77">Col. Francisco
                                Urrutia, Commander in Chief of the Ecuadoran Army.</note> and
                            Commander Barbaro,<note n="78" xml:id="d238fn78">Comdr. Joseph R.
                                Barbaro, Chief of the U. S. Naval Mission to Ecuador.</note> that a
                            $30,000,000 credit, to be used by Ecuador for acquiring all sorts of
                            armament equipment for the Navy and Army, was a <hi rend="italic">sine
                                qua non</hi> as a condition precedent to reaching conclusions.</p>
                        <p>The President said that I was mistaken. However, he added, the fact that
                            the Ecuadoran Congress had authorized him to arrange a credit up to
                            $30,000,000 was a factor which must be taken into consideration, as the
                            Congress was an important branch of the Government.</p>
                        <p>The President explained that it was not possible for one unacquainted
                            with the cost of airplanes, ships, anti-aircraft guns, and all the other
                            equipment which might fall under the general classification of defense
                            materials, to think in terms of dollars as readily as he might in terms
                            of the indispensable requirements: for all he knew, the total might run
                            considerably beyond $30,000,000.</p>
                        <p>The President then said he would like to change the subject for a moment
                            to the political condition existing in the country. He thought the
                            majority of the thinking people were in favor of the democracies, but
                            the Axis powers were so skillful in presentation of arguments extolling
                            the merits of the planned economy which was to run the world if Hitler
                            won, and also in their propaganda, which constantly kept before the
                            public the wonderful military organization of the Axis powers, that it
                            was not surprising that there was also another school of thought. He
                            favored the democracies but as President it was necessary for him to
                            show a certain amount of consideration for the views of Ecuadoran
                            citizens. As an illustration of his attitude, he referred to the
                            application of the Ecuapetrol, German oil syndicate, successor to Otto
                            Wolff, for a renewal of its concession. The President informed me that,
                            notwithstanding the fact <pb n="292" xml:id="pg_292" facs="0300"/>that
                            when the application reached his desk it had every required legal
                            endorsement, he had declined to renew the Ecuapetrol concession. This
                            act, he said, would unquestionably bring tremendous pressure to bear
                            upon him to reverse his position.</p>
                        <p>President Arroyo then stated that his greatest need was a demonstration
                            which the public could see—for example, a few Ecuadoran pilots flying
                            planes which belonged to Ecuador, and at least one and possibly two
                            small ships which could fly the Ecuadoran flag. Both planes and ships
                            would be interpreted by his public as a demonstration that something was
                            being accomplished by his administration and thus tend to counteract the
                            contentions of pro-Axis thinkers that the democracies talked much and
                            did little.</p>
                        <p>These planes and one or more ships would, the President continued, serve
                            as laboratories for the training of members of the Aviation Corps and
                            also of the Navy. If Ecuador was ever to make a beginning, it would have
                            to start with these; hence he had no hesitancy in being perfectly plain
                            about the immediate needs of his country. He referred to the aviation
                            training schools to be built at Salinas (for primary training) and Quito
                            (for advanced training) as also indispensable, stating that they, too,
                            would be helpful at this time. He felt that these were minimum
                            requirements of the moment and that this was the psychological time for
                            something to be done. He expressed the hope that our Government would be
                            able to give early consideration to Ecuador’s needs and would lose no
                            time in cooperating with him in this moment of emergency.</p>
                        <p>The President stated that he was glad I was going to Washington and hoped
                            that I would work with his Ambassador to the end that an early solution
                            might be reached as to the problems mentioned herein.</p>

                            military and naval matériel during the next few years to a total value
                            of 400 million dollars. Pursuant to the President’s instructions each of
                            the American Republics has been informed of the amount of military and
                            naval equipment which will be furnished to it and each country has been
                            requested immediately to designate military and naval aides to discuss
                            with the War and Navy Department here what it desires to obtain within
                            the allocation set aside for it.</p>
                        <p>The visit referred to in your telegram of reference is for this purpose.
                            Although appreciative of your suggestion, the Department sees no reason
                            for recommending delay in the departure of the mission since this
                            program is not only one of general application to all of the American
                            Republics but conversations are already taking place here between

                        <p>After I had outlined to him the various steps to be taken by each
                            interested government in order to obtain the amounts allotted by the
                            Joint Army-Navy Advisory Board, he told me that he had just received a
                            telegram from his President asking whether the Ecuadoran Government
                            could obtain twenty million rounds of 7.92 caliber ammunition, ten
                            million rounds for machine guns, and ten million rounds for rifles. If
                            these cartridges could be delivered as soon as possible and, in any
                            event, within the fiscal year ending June 30, 1942, the Ecuadoran
                            Government would expedite the steps necessary to acquire the armaments
                            allotted by the Joint Army-Navy Advisory Board.</p>
                        <p>Consultation with Colonel MacMorland<note n="85" xml:id="d241fn85">Col.
                                Edward E. MacMorland, War Department Liaison Officer with the
                                National Munitions Control Board.</note> revealed that no ammunition
                            of this caliber is being manufactured at present in the United States
                            and that in order to do so it would be necessary for the factories to
                            change their machinery. This would not be worth their while for such a
                            small order. Colonel MacMorland went on to say that the only rifle and
                            machine gun ammunition that is now being manufactured consists of .30,
                            .50, and .303 calibers. I transmitted this information to the Ambassador
                            and he asked whether there might be some stocks of the 7.92 cartridges
                            on hand. I passed this inquiry on to Colonel MacMorland, who answered
                            that he was certain that no such stocks existed. This reply was conveyed
                            to the Ambassador.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador told me that the machine guns in question were
                            manufactured by the Skoda Works in Czechoslovakia and that the rifles
                            were Mausers and Mannlichers.</p>

                                Military Aviation Mission in Ecuador.</note> to Colonel Urrutia
                            which totals approximately $2,000,000.00 or 40% of the total available
                            prior to July 1, 1942.</p>
                        <p>The Minister of Finance may not be familiar with these details.
                            Consequently, this report is sent in advance so that the respective
                            Departments of our Government may be prepared to discuss allotments in
                            the event that they are willing to take the matter up with Mr.
                            Illingworth.</p>
                        <p>I am informally advised that at this moment there are available nine
                            fairly dependable Ecuadoran pilots; and that at the end of probably four
                            months’ training eleven additional pilots (who would then be competent)
                            will become available. In addition, it will be recalled that primary
                            training is to begin as soon as the new Primary Trainers being shipped
                            from California arrive in Ecuador. That is, this training should start
                            about the middle of September.</p>
                        <p>The Air Mission in Ecuador tells me that they are counting upon the
                            assignment of one additional Officer more or less as indicated in Mr.
                            Welles’ letter to the Secretary of War dated June 28.<note n="89"
                                xml:id="d242fn1">Not printed.</note> It is urged, of course, that
                            the new man be a qualified instructor who speaks Spanish, and that he
                            arrive here without delay.</p>
                        <p>If the $2,000,000.00 are made available in aviation equipment, as
                            suggested by our Aviation Mission, it is thought that the Army can be
                            supplied with sufficient cartridges to satisfy present requirements with
                            $3,000,000.00.</p>

                        <p>791. From Under Secretary. This Government is confronted with an
                            increasingly embarrassing situation resulting from the continuing
                            efforts on the part of both Peru and Ecuador to purchase airplanes,
                            armaments and ammunition in the United States. It has seemed to the
                            Department that at a time when hostilities had regrettably broken out
                            between Peru and Ecuador, although these hostilities have at least been
                            suspended, but with no prospect in sight for any prompt pacific solution
                            of this dispute it would not be in the interest of inter-American
                            relations for the United States to permit the shipment from this country
                            of military matériel which would inevitably be utilized by the Peruvian
                            and Ecuadoran military forces should hostilities again break out. It is
                            primarily for that reason that the War Department is requisitioning 18
                            modern bombers which the Peruvian Government had purchased in Canada
                            from the Norwegian Government and which were in transit through the
                            United States, although these airplanes are urgently needed in our own
                            defense program, and will be utilized in that way.</p>
                        <p>I am informed that the Bolivian Government desires to dispose of certain
                            excess military equipment which it has available and that there is a
                            probability that this matériel will be purchased by Peru.</p>
                        <p>It seems to me that the question involved is a fundamental one of
                            principle affecting the interests of all the American Republics and that
                            it would be highly desirable and beneficial if the American Republics
                            would join in making it known that they would not permit <pb n="297"
                                xml:id="pg_297" facs="0305"/>the sale of military or naval matériel
                            to the two parties to the dispute until and unless a pacific solution of
                            the controversy were under way.</p>
                        <p>At a meeting which I had this afternoon with the Argentine and Brazilian
                            Ambassadors here I requested them to take this matter up informally with
                            their respective governments so that I might have the benefit of the
                            point of view of the Governments of Argentina and Brazil with the
                            thought that should those two governments concur, the three governments
                            could join in making this suggestion to the governments of the other
                            American Republics.</p>
                        <p>The Argentine Ambassador is reporting to his Foreign Minister by
                            telegraph and asked particularly that I inform you of this question and
                            ask you likewise to talk the matter over with the Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs. Please do so and report by cable any action you may take. I am,
                            of course, particularly anxious that the matter be regarded as informal
                            and completely confidential at this stage. [Welles.]</p>

                            imports of products in Schedule I of the trade agreement under authority
                            of recent legislation enacted for the purpose of obtaining revenues to
                            liquidate possible loans for new water-supply systems in various cities
                            of Ecuador. The Ecuadoran Minister of Finance was reported to have
                            stated in this connection that he would withhold application of the
                            additional duties mentioned until March 31, 1941 if the Department would
                            arrange for the extension by the Export-Import Bank of Washington of a
                            credit of $3,000,000 to the Ecuadoran Government for construction of the
                            water-supply systems in question.</p>
                        <p>As you explained to the Minister of Finance, the decisions concerning
                            specific loans by the Export-Import Bank are based on the merits of the
                            individual applications for such loans. As the Ecuadoran Ministers of
                            Foreign Affairs and Finance indicated might be the case, in the course
                            of their discussion of this matter with you, there has as yet been no
                            direct application by the Ecuadoran Government or by the Municipalities
                            of Guayaquil or Quito for the loan of a specific amount or amounts for
                            the construction of new waterworks systems.</p>
                        <p>Several months ago the Ecuadoran Ambassador<note n="97" xml:id="d246fn97"
                                >Colón Eloy Alfaro.</note> informed the Department orally of the
                            interest of the President of Ecuador in the possibility of obtaining
                            credits for a new water supply system in Guayaquil. This information was
                            brought to the attention of the Export-Import Bank, and at the same time
                            the Department expressed its interest in the project. The Bank
                            officials, however, have at no time in the course of discussing this
                            matter given any specific indication of a favorable disposition toward
                            extending such credit assistance, and the action of the Bank so far has
                            been restricted to the authorization of $700 of its funds for the
                            expenses of an engineer <pb n="299" xml:id="pg_299" facs="0307"/>who
                            will obtain more information concerning the projects in Guayaquil and
                            Quito. The arrangements for the preliminary survey work to be conducted
                            by this engineer, Mr. Frank E. DeMartini of the United States Public
                            Health Service, were described to you in detail in the Department’s
                            instruction no. 414 of January 22, 1941.<note n="98" xml:id="d246fn98"
                                >Not printed.</note></p>
                        <p>When Mr. DeMartini completes his compilation of preliminary data with
                            respect to the probable nature and cost of new water-works systems in
                            Guayaquil and Quito, it is expected that the information prepared by him
                            will be studied by the appropriate agencies of this Government. It is
                            hoped that the data will likewise be of use to the Ecuadoran authorities
                            in considering a possible loan application or applications.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the application of the additional customs duties to
                            products in Schedule I of the trade agreement, you may inform the
                            Minister of Finance that it is believed to be most practicable to
                            consider this question separately. If, however, the Minister insists
                            upon linking the questions together and the issue therefore arises of
                            the conflict with the provisions of the agreement, you may inform him of
                            the substance of the confidential paragraph in the Department’s telegram
                            no. 5 of January 8, 1941.<note n="99" xml:id="d246fn99">Not printed.
                                This paragraph reads: “For your information, if after due
                                consideration of these possibilities the Ecuadoran Government should
                                take the position that sufficient revenues could not feasibly be
                                raised in a manner consonant with the provisions of the trade
                                agreement the Department would, of course, be glad to consider any
                                specific proposals by that Government for changes in the agreement.”
                                (822.151/35)</note> Before doing this, however, you should assure
                            yourself that the Ecuadoran officials have a full understanding of the
                            revenue possibilities in the suggestion contained in the second
                            paragraph of the Department’s telegram no. 1 of January 2, 1941.<note

                            would appear desirable to emphasize this point again to the Ecuadoran

                        <p>In the first place, the President, for a number of reasons, has not
                            considered it desirable for this Government to initiate negotiations
                            with the Government of Ecuador for the purpose of obtaining a lease on
                            the Galápagos Islands. Those reasons still seem entirely valid
                                today.<note n="7" xml:id="d248fn7">For correspondence concerning the
                                interest of the United States in the Galápagos Islands for defense

                        <p>In the second place, from the standpoint of the maintenance of our
                            extremely friendly and helpful relations with all the American
                            Governments on matters of hemisphere defense, it would not, in my
                            opinion, be desirable to make any approach to the Ecuadoran Government
                            for the purpose you indicate. For example, as long as the Ecuador–Peru
                            boundary dispute<note n="8" xml:id="d248fn8">For correspondence
                                concerning this dispute, see <ref target="frus1941v06#pg_212">vol.

                            outstanding, any action by this Government to secure a base on the
                            Galápagos Islands would immediately be suspected by Peru as involving a
                            pledge of support by the United States to Ecuador in connection with the
                            boundary problem. It is indispensable to our security that our relations
                            with all the American countries remain on their present friendly
                            footing, and that no step be taken that would impair this relationship
                            even with one country.</p>
                        <p>Finally, it does not seem wise to link together the granting of credits
                            for social purposes with the obtaining of defense facilities. I am glad
                            to observe, however, that you are prepared to consider, in the granting
                            of credits, reasons of a broad general character.</p>
                        <p>I take the occasion to express the very sincere hope that you will find
                            it possible to proceed to construct the water systems at Quito and
                            Guayaquil. I, of course, do not suggest the extension of credits except
                            on a sound basis, but from what I am informed it should be possible to
                            work out some plan for constructing these water systems that would
                            permit repayment of the credits.</p>
                        <p>Within the last few days the Ambassador of Ecuador has presented to the

                        <p>The Minister of Finance explained the desire of his Government either to
                            reach a gentleman’s agreement on the trade agreement or, if that weren’t
                            possible, to modify the terms of the agreement in order to provide
                            greater revenues for the Government of Ecuador. Customs revenues have
                            been declining during the past two years due to the influence of the war
                            and an increase is now needed in order to provide services and interest
                            on the proposed loan for the Guayaquil and Quito waterworks.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Smith gave it as his preliminary opinion that some arrangement could
                            be reached which would allow an increase in Ecuadoran revenues without
                            actual modification of the treaty. If further study, however, proves
                            this impossible, he expressed the belief that the Department would be
                            willing to make some suitable modification in conformance with Ecuadoran
                            desires and at the same time preserve the spirit of the agreement.</p>
                        <p>The Minister explained that Ecuador is denouncing all of its commercial
                            agreements with the exception of the one with the United States and an
                            agreement which is now in process of negotiation with Chile. This fact,
                            he felt, entitles Ecuador to special treatment by the United States
                            which will be in a peculiarly favored position.</p>
                        <p>Conversations will be continued on the basis of more detailed
                            studies.</p>

                        <p>Reference is made to conversations which have taken place recently in the
                            Department of State regarding the desire of the Government of Ecuador,
                            in the present emergency, to increase customs and other revenues, and
                            the restrictions imposed by the trade agreement between the United
                            States and Ecuador against any increase in customs <pb n="303"
                                xml:id="pg_303" facs="0311"/>duties on products imported from the
                            United States and included in Schedule I of that agreement.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States has given sympathetic consideration
                            to the fiscal problems confronting the Government of Ecuador in the
                            existing economic situation and is prepared to work out an arrangement
                            along the lines of that discussed in the Department of State with the
                            Ecuadoran Minister of Finance.</p>
                        <p>It is believed that the desire of the Government of Ecuador for greater
                            freedom of action in increasing customs duties can most readily be
                            attained through the termination of those provisions of the trade
                            agreement between the United States and Ecuador which now impede such
                            action. It would of course be necessary at the same time to terminate
                            those provisions of the agreement relating to the customs treatment
                            accorded Ecuadoran products imported into the United States and included
                            in Schedule II of the trade agreement.</p>
                        <p>A minor point regarding Schedule I involves the note referring to
                            pharmaceutical products which follows Tariff Item 374. It is assumed
                            that the Government of Ecuador would have no objection to the retention
                            of that note in the agreement.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States is of the opinion that a revision of
                            the trade agreement such as would thus be effected, offers an
                            opportunity to bring about a further change relating to Article X, on
                            exchange control. As it is believed that this Article, in the form in
                            which it is drafted, is somewhat too rigid to meet existing conditions,
                            it is believed that it might be eliminated. However, in order that some
                            provisions might be in force between the two countries with respect to
                            exchange control measures, it is proposed that the notes to be exchanged
                            between the Governments of the United States and Ecuador provide in
                            substance for the granting of most-favored-nation treatment with respect
                            to exchange matters.</p>
                        <p>The changes in the trade agreement set forth above would involve the
                            termination of Articles I, II, III, IV (except in so far as it refers to
                            the note regarding pharmaceutical products following item 374 of
                            Schedule I), VI, VII and X. The remainder of the trade agreement would,
                            of course, remain in full force and effect.</p>
                        <p>As the Minister of Finance of Ecuador has expressed the desire that the
                            matter under consideration be handled definitively in Quito, it is
                            contemplated that appropriate instructions in the sense of the foregoing
                            will be sent to the American Minister at Quito. From the standpoint of
                            the United States the arrangement set forth above could be handled by
                            means of an exchange of notes between the American Minister at Quito and
                            the Foreign Minister of Ecuador.</p>

                            Foreign Minister. You should inquire at the same time whether the
                            executive authority in Ecuador is empowered to bring the provisions of
                            the notes into force without their having previously been submitted to

                            be exchanged and the date to be inserted in the second paragraph of the
                            notes, which date will be such as to allow at least a thirty-day period

                                which it is confronted, that certain provisions of the trade
                                agreement between the United States of America and the Republic of
                                Ecuador signed at Quito on August 6, 1938, as amended by notes
                                exchanged at Quito on August 6, 1938, September 9, 1938, and
                                September 13, 1938, be terminated.</p>
                            <p>I now desire to confirm and make of record by this note the agreement
                                which, as a result of the conversations referred to, has been
                                reached between the Government of the United States of America and
                                the Government of the Republic of Ecuador that the provisions of

                            <p>The Government of the United States has noted with pleasure the
                                willingness of the Government of Ecuador to enter into negotiations

                                the above-mentioned provisions of the trade agreement of August 6,
                                1938.</p>
                            <p>I also desire to confirm that the Government of the United States and
                                the Government of the Republic of Ecuador are in further agreement,

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Tewksbury</hi>: I was glad to receive your
                            letter of October 25<note n="13" xml:id="d252fn13">Not printed.</note>
                            in regard to the Finance Minister’s desire to apply higher rates of duty
                            as soon as possible and to remove the commitment in the trade agreement
                            which stands in the way of such action.</p>
                        <p>As you and Mr. Long have stated, Schedule II would, as a practical
                            matter, have to be terminated if Schedule I were terminated, and at the
                            same time. As to the time between public notice of termination of both
                            schedules and the effective date, we would, I feel sure, agree to
                            whatever the Government of Ecuador might suggest, provided at least 30
                            days’ notice were given.</p>
                        <p>However, we have not been too happy about the prospect of terminating
                            both schedules. In the case of Schedule II, termination would have an
                            adverse effect on the hat industry in Ecuador and here, and if we should
                            eventually give the concession to Peru, we would give up a considerable
                            part of our limited bargaining power with Ecuador. In the case of
                            Schedule I, our exporters would not only be faced with increased rates
                            (20 percent higher, according to Mr. Illingworth) but would not have
                            definite assurance that the rates would not go back, later on if not
                            immediately, to pre-agreement levels plus 20 percent. This would be so
                            despite Mr. Illingworth’s statement that the Government of Ecuador has
                            no intention of restoring the pre-agreement rates and adding the 20
                            percent to such rates.</p>
                        <p>I am leaning in the direction of a different approach to the solution of
                            this problem, namely: <pb n="307" xml:id="pg_307" facs="0315"/>

                                <item>The Government of Ecuador would address a note to us stressing
                                    the financial emergency now confronting the country as a result
                                    of the war; loss of European markets and decline of imports from
                                    Europe with consequent diminution of customs revenue which makes
                                    up such a large percentage of total national revenue; stating
                                    desire to raise all customs duties by 20 percent as an emergency
                                    measure, purely fiscal in nature and purpose, deemed necessary
                                    in order to safeguard the vital interests of the nation; stating
                                    also the intention to remove this emergency surcharge as soon as
                                    the wartime emergency has passed; asking whether, in view of the
                                    foregoing, this Government would refrain from invoking the
                                    pertinent provisions of the trade agreement, which was
                                    negotiated in time of peace and which does not specifically
                                    provide sufficient flexibility to take care of wartime emergency
                                    situations such as that now confronting Ecuador; and winding up
                                    with a statement to the effect that the only alternative would
                                    appear to be termination of both schedules, an alternative which
                                    the Government of Ecuador would naturally regret having to
                                    propose.</item>

                                <item>This Government would reply appropriately to the effect that,
                                    in all the circumstances, it would not invoke the pertinent
                                    provisions of the agreement; perhaps adding something designed
                                    to protect goods in transit.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>I should like very much to have Mr. Long’s reaction, and yours, to this
                            possible alternative approach. Meanwhile, I shall take it up with others

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Hawkins</hi>: This acknowledges your air mail
                            letter of November 5, which for some reason did not reach us until
                            November 18.</p>
                        <p>I have discussed the contents of your letter with Mr. Long and while we
                            both agree that if possible some solution other than the discarding of
                            Schedules I and II of the Trade Agreement would be desirable, it does
                            not appear that the suggested alternative contained in your letter could
                            be adopted.</p>
                        <p>The entire proposal involving a change in the Trade Agreement arose from
                            the fact that the Ecuadoran Congress, in the fall of 1940, approved a
                            law providing various new taxes for specific waterworks projects. As you
                            will recall, these taxes involve, among other things, an additional ad
                            valorem tax of 5½ per cent and customs <pb n="308" xml:id="pg_308"
                                facs="0316"/>surcharges, totaling 7 per cent. As you say, Mr.
                            Illingworth estimates that the new taxes represent an increase in the
                            amount of duty to be paid of about 20 per cent.</p>
                        <p>The law was passed specifically for the purpose of providing funds for
                            waterworks projects throughout the country. Furthermore, the taxes
                            established in the law were allocated for specific individual projects.
                            For instance, the law provided that the revenues of the 5½ per cent ad
                            valorem tax were to be divided as follows: <list>
                                <item>¾ per cent for the water supply for Quito;</item>
                                <item>¾ per cent for the water supply for Guayaquil;</item>
                                <item>4 per cent to be divided equally among the 15 Provinces, not

                        <p>The 7 per cent customs surcharge was to be divided as follows: <list>

                        <p>Various additional provisions are made in the law regarding the
                            application of taxes collected.</p>
                        <p>In view of the fact that the law is not directly connected with disturbed
                            world conditions, it appears doubtful if the proposal, as outlined in
                            your letter could be used. Since the taxes were imposed for the purpose
                            of obtaining badly needed water supply systems throughout the country,
                            it is very doubtful if there was any intention of making these taxes
                            temporary. To carry out the waterworks projects which are needed will
                            require many years of application of the taxes provided in the
                            measure.</p>
                        <p>In order to follow some procedure such as you outline, it would
                            apparently be necessary for the President to abrogate the legislative
                            decree, which would unquestionably cause very strenuous opposition. The
                            water situation in both Quito and Guayaquil is very serious and early
                            action is essential. Since July, there have been but few days when water
                            has been available throughout the day in Quito. As illustrative of the
                            seriousness of the situation, the entire city of Quito has been without
                            water, except for a few hours in the middle of the night, for two days
                            and nights during the present week. Such water as was obtainable was the
                            color of strong coffee. If the President, under his emergency powers,
                            should abrogate the waterworks law, even in an effort to save the Trade
                            Agreement, the reaction would doubtless be far more violent than the
                            outcry which arose during this last complete failure.</p>
                        <p>If you can think of any method by which Ecuador could be authorized to
                            collect the taxes provided in the waterworks law on products <pb n="309"
                                xml:id="pg_309" facs="0317"/>listed in Schedule I and still retain
                            both Schedules I and II in force, I am sure that the Minister of
                            Finance, as well as the Foreign Office, would be only too glad to
                            cooperate. The Minister of Finance feels that the inability to collect
                            the waterworks tax on Schedule I products is definitely against the
                            interests of Ecuador, and there is probably no question but that he
                            would ultimately prefer to abrogate the entire Agreement rather than
                            lose these essential added revenues.</p>

                            $1,640,000 in the total. I discussed this at some length with Mr.
                            Bustamante and others and have reached the conclusion that it would be
                            very desirable for us to request the War Department to agree to these
                            small increases. We have some funds available; the Government of El
                            Salvador has obviously made a very careful analysis of its needs and is
                            proceeding on a very business-like basis, and in a number of other
                            requests we are having favorable business arrangements with Mr.
                            Bustamante. I believe from every point of view it would be helpful if we
                            could accede to this small request. I hope consequently that you will
                            feel it possible to take the matter up at once with the War Department
                            and attempt to get their approval within a few days since Mr. Bustamante
                            must and is anxious to get the approval of his Government before signing
                            the basic agreement.</p>

                        <p>This subject was fully discussed with the Foreign Minister on the
                            forenoon of December 15, at which time I was informed that he would get
                            in touch with the President and call me by telephone. At that time I
                            prepared a memorandum to be given to the President himself by the
                            liaison officer designated by the President to provide immediate
                            informal communication between the President and the Legation. In this

                            prepared telegram No. 247, triple priority, of December 15, 8 p.m.,<note

                            left with the Foreign Minister and the official answer, both of which
                            would constitute the exchange of written communications contemplated in
                            the Department’s telegram, would be forwarded.</p>

                            addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and a copy of his reply
                            (Note No. 17579), together with a translation thereof, which has just
                            been placed in my hands, wherein the Government expresses its full

                                which you are good enough to state that there have come to pass the
                                events envisaged in Resolution XV which was adopted at the Havana
                                Consultative Meeting, which stipulates that should there be an
                                aggression “all the signatory nations or two or more of them
                                according to circumstances shall proceed to negotiate the necessary

                                and the assistance that they shall lend each other.”</p>
                            <p>Guatemala and the United States of America are already working
                                together with the common objective of defeating the aggressor

                                informs me, your worthy Government desires to begin immediately an
                                unconditioned military cooperation, for which purpose you have
                                received instructions to enter into an agreement by which the
                                Government of Guatemala might grant the following privileges:</p>
                            <p>[Here follows descriptive list of privileges given in note No. 222,
                                    <hi rend="italic">supra.</hi>]</p>
                            <p>Your Honor states, finally, that your Government feels confident that
                                the continued and full cooperation between the armed forces of the
                                two countries will be forthcoming for the achievement of the aims
                                which animate both nations.</p>
                            <p>In due reply, it is for me a great pleasure to reiterate to Your
                                Honor, and through you, to the friendly Government of the United
                                States of America, that the Government of the Republic of Guatemala
                                is animated by the same objectives and, through its desire to lend
                                the most effective cooperation for continental defense, in
                                accordance with Resolution XV adopted at the Meeting of Havana, is
                                pleased to grant the privileges which are detailed in your kind
                                note, for the duration of the present emergency.</p>
                            <p>Therefore, in conformity with the statements which Your Honor was
                                good enough to make in your communication now being answered, the
                                present approval of the Government of Guatemala constitutes a formal
                                agreement to that end.</p>

                        <p>Colonel Bessette, of our Military Mission to Haiti, called this
                            afternoon. I discussed with him the various aspects of the plan to
                            provide Haiti with military equipment according to the recommendations
                            of the Joint Military-Naval Advisory Board. He told me that he had
                            already visited the War and Navy Departments and had told Major Johnston
                            and Captain Spears that there had been prepared, under his advice, a
                            list of military and naval matériel to be furnished Haiti during the
                            fiscal year ending June 30, 1942. He has also familiarized himself with
                            the system of requisitions in order to be of assistance to the Haitian
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>During the conversation, I referred to the basic agreement and to the
                            position which I assumed Colonel Bessette would take with respect to the
                            Haitian authorities. I informed him that while it appeared quite proper
                            for him to advise the Haitian officials with respect to the procurement
                            of armament, it was necessary for the latter to conduct formal
                            negotiations with the United States Government and sign all necessary
                            documents. Colonel Bessette replied that he was fully aware of this.</p>
                        <p>He showed me lists of war and naval matériel which he had already
                            compiled. The former consisted principally of small arms, with the
                            requisite ammunition, motor trucks, military clothing, and
                            accouterments. The naval matériel did not include any vessels but
                            instead such articles as buoys, lighthouses, a marine railway, etc. I
                            pointed out to Colonel Bessette that it had been my understanding that
                            the amount allotted Haiti for naval expenditures provided for the
                            acquisition of one or two patrol vessels. He replied that the articles
                            he had listed would be of much more value to hemisphere defense. He
                            intimated that Captain Spears had concurred.</p>
                        <pb n="318" xml:id="pg_318" facs="0326"/>
                        <p>I gathered that both of these lists would soon be put in final shape at
                            Port-au-Prince and then forwarded to the Haitian Legation for delivery
                            to the Department. After they have been transmitted to the War and Navy
                            Departments, they can be handled expeditiously, as no negotiations or
                            discussions will be necessary.</p>
                        <p>I took advantage of Colonel Bessette’s visit to ask his views on the
                            advisability of sending a Haitian Military Attaché to Washington. He
                            replied that the racial problem would not afford occasion for
                            embarrassment as the Haitians understood the situation sufficiently
                            well. A short time ago, two young Haitain officers had taken extensive
                            military courses at Fort Benning, where Colonel Bessette was stationed.
                            No disagreeable incidents occurred, although Colonel Bessette
                            acknowledged that he had kept a very close watch over these young men.
                            Pie added that Colonel Levelt of the Haitian Guard would not come to the
                            United States in connection with the procurement of military matériel,
                            as had been intimated by the Haitian Minister.</p>

                            prior to February 1 would appear to be urgent so that the fiscal
                            representative may legally withhold further remittances to the fiscal

                        <p>24. Your 10, January 27, 11 a.m. and your letter to Finley, January
                                24.<note n="8" xml:id="d262fn8">Latter not printed.</note> The
                            Department has not been kept informed in detail by your Legation, the
                            Fiscal Representative, or the Haitian Government, regarding the
                            negotiations which have been proceeding with the Foreign Bondholders
                            Council for the desired reduction in interest rate on Haitian bonds. In
                            particular it has not been informed what further steps may have been
                            taken by the Haitian Government, by the Fiscal Representative, or both,
                            since the Council suggested that it was willing to agree to a reduction
                            from 6 percent to 4½ percent.</p>
                        <p>The Fiscal Representative is aware that the Department has indicated that
                            it believes a reduction from 6 percent to 4 percent reasonable and that
                            he or the Haitian Government, or both, should carry on the necessary
                            negotiations with the Council. If these have not been pursued, the
                            Department is unable to understand the reason for the delay and suggests
                            that negotiations be continued. Until it is informed that a stalemate
                            has been reached, the Department believes <pb n="323" xml:id="pg_323"
                                facs="0331"/>that this is a matter for the Haitian Government and

                        <p>14. Department’s telegram No. 24, January 28, 7 p.m. In a conference this
                            morning with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Finance,<note n="11"
                                xml:id="d263fn11">Fernand Dennis.</note> the Fiscal Representative
                            and myself, President Vincent declared that while Lescot had reported
                            that an understanding had been reached between him and Francis
                                White<note n="12" xml:id="d263fn12">President of the Foreign
                                Bondholders Protective Council.</note> the Council has not replied
                            to the request of the Haitian Government for a reduction of 2 percent in
                            the interest rate on the 1922 bonds.</p>
                        <p>Upon questioning as to the nature of the understanding President Vincent
                            believed that it was for a postponement and not a definitive reduction.
                            President Vincent declared that while he considered a definitive
                            reduction essential he would agree to the postponement affecting the
                            April and October coupons but that he hoped that a committee could be
                            formed immediately for the purpose of considering a definitive
                            reduction. Since he is unable to foresee at this time when the postponed
                            interest might be paid he suggested the immediate conclusion of an
                            accord covering interest payments from October 1, 1940 to December 31,
                            1941 at the rate of 4 percent—the remaining 2 percent to be made the
                            subject of negotiations with the bondholders.</p>
                        <p>President Vincent expressed the hope that the Department would be willing
                            to use its good offices with the Council.</p>

                        <p>It did not appear quite clear from telegram no. 14 from Port-au-Prince
                            that the Haitian Government was aware of the Department’s <pb n="324"
                                xml:id="pg_324" facs="0332"/>point of view respecting the reduction
                            of the interest rate on Haitian bonds as expressed in the Department’s
                            telegram no. 24. I telephoned Mr. Sparks at Port-au-Prince who assured
                            me that he had made known the Department’s viewpoint to President
                            Vincent, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and the Fiscal Representative
                            yesterday.</p>
                        <p>I said that that being the case we could not understand why Mr. de la Rue
                            was not forging ahead with the negotiations with the Bondholders
                            Council. We were still in the dark as to what was going on although we
                            continued to receive requests for the use of our good offices vis-à-vis
                            the Council and in behalf of Haiti. Mr. Sparks agreed that the
                            Department had instructed Mr. de la Rue last August to broach the
                            question of the interest rate on Haitian bonds to Mr. White. He said Mr.
                            de la Rue had done this and had then returned to Haiti. Later, when Mr.
                            de la Rue proposed to come to the United States to discuss this question
                            further with the Bondholders Council, he was informed that the
                            Department desired him to remain in Haiti and that it felt M. Lescot
                            could carry on the negotiations. I judge that thereafter, Mr. de la Rue
                            has washed his hands of the whole question, although he has from time to
                            time invited the attention of the Legation at Port-au-Prince to interest
                            payment due on February 1. It was only yesterday, January 29, that Mr.
                            de la Rue had again been requested by the Haitian Government to resume
                            negotiations with the Council. Mr. Sparks did not know what Mr. de la
                            Rue had done since yesterday, nor whether he had telephoned to Mr.
                            White, or written, or anything. He said he would get in touch with Mr.
                            de la Rue and find out.</p>
                        <p>I told Mr. Sparks that some of us here felt that it would be better from
                            every point of view if the Haitian Government or Mr. de la Rue could
                            persuade the Bondholders Council not to oppose a reduction in the
                            interest rate rather than have the Department intervene at this time.
                            Mr. Sparks said however that, as always, the Haitian Government depended
                            on us to pull their chestnuts out of the fire, to which I replied that,
                            in my opinion, there is far too much call on the Department for services
                            which could be as well performed by the Haitian Government itself or by
                            Mr. de la Rue.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Sparks then inquired whether we could not merely instruct Mr. de la
                            Rue not to make the interest payment due February 1. I said that it
                            seemed to me that Mr. de la Rue’s duty of making the payment arose from
                            the Accord of 1933<note n="13" xml:id="d264fn13">Signed August 7, 1933,

                                    755</ref>.</note> which accord could not be unilaterally altered
                            by us. Mr. Sparks then added that he hoped we might authorize Mr. de la
                            Rue to defer making the interest payment due February 1 until February
                            15 since he understood that the Fiscal Agents would not consider that a
                            default had occurred until that date. <pb n="325" xml:id="pg_325"
                                facs="0333"/>I replied that Mr. de la Rue was well aware of his
                            responsibility vis-à-vis the Fiscal Agents and I felt sure that nobody
                            in the Department would feel at this time that they could relieve him of
                            these responsibilities, and that Mr. de la Rue would therefore have to
                            use his own judgment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Sparks went on to add that M. Lescot has been ill for the last two
                            days and that he had not therefore been able to get in touch with him to
                            understand more clearly how far Lescot’s negotiations with the
                            Bondholders Council had gone. He said, however, that M. Lescot was going
                            to the Senate this morning and that he would try to get in touch with
                            him this afternoon.</p>
                        <p>He said he would also appeal to Mr. de la Rue to hasten his negotiations
                            with the Council.</p>

                        <p>17. Referring to my telephone conversation with Mr. Finley, Minister
                            Lescot has been ill and I was unable to talk with him before this
                            afternoon.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the negotiations with the Foreign Bondholders Protective
                            Council he apparently reached no understanding and was awaiting its
                            reply. In fact he did not communicate to the Council the rejection by
                            the Haitian Government of its offer of postponement of 1½ per cent of
                            the interest limiting his action to informing the Department of
                            State.</p>
                        <p>While I made clear yesterday to President Vincent and the Foreign

                            telegram 24, January 28, I reiterated it this afternoon to the Minister
                            for Foreign Affairs. He understands it clearly, he is impressed with the
                            urgency and in my presence he authorized the Fiscal Representative to
                            take over the negotiations. The latter was unable to telephone Mr. White
                            this evening but he has arranged to do so tomorrow morning.</p>

                        <p>28. In your discussions with the Haitian Government concerning the
                            proposed reduction in the interest rate on Haitian bonds, the Department
                                <pb n="326" xml:id="pg_326" facs="0334"/>assumes that you have
                            already made it clear that this course is not being urged upon the
                            Haitian Government. It is felt that in particular the Haitian Government
                            in making its decision should not entirely overlook the possibility that
                            a partial default in the interest payments, even if it were satisfactory
                            to the Foreign Bondholders Protective Council, might prejudice the
                            practical possibility of opening the discussions, in which it is
                            understood the Haitian Government is interested for the revision of the
                            Accord of 1933.</p>
                        <p>In bringing these considerations to the attention of President Vincent
                            you may say that it is not the intention of the Department to discourage
                            the Haitian Government from proceeding with its negotiations for such a
                            reduction as it deems necessary in the interest rate, but on the other
                            hand, it feels that the Haitian Government should not overlook the
                            consideration above set forth.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Francis White, President of the Foreign Bondholders Protective
                            Council, telephoned me at 4:45 today to say that at the meeting of the
                            Executive Committee of the Council, it had been decided to approve the
                            proposal of Mr. de la Rue that the interest on Haitian bonds during the
                            present calendar year be paid at the rate of 4 percent rather than at 6
                            percent. Mr. White said that the Council’s action was based on Mr. de la
                            Rue’s statement that the Haitian situation had become worse since he had
                            last communicated with the Council, in the sense that the British
                            Government had declined to purchase Haitian cotton and sugar. He
                            inquired whether this was correct and I assured him that it was.</p>
                        <p>Mr. White said that he was telegraphing Mr. de la Rue of the Council’s
                            action today and that he supposed it would be necessary for some sort of
                            an agreement modifying the Accord of 1933 to be concluded between the
                            United States and the Haitian Government. I said that I was not certain
                            of this and that we were looking up the point.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Welles</hi>: You may recall that at a meeting
                            held in your office last autumn when the Haitian situation was generally
                            discussed, Mr. <pb n="327" xml:id="pg_327" facs="0335"/>de la Rue was
                            authorized, after some opposition had been expressed, to explore with
                            the Foreign Bondholders Protective Council, Incorporated, the question
                            of the reduction in interest rate on Haitian bonds from 6 percent to 4
                            percent. Mr. de la Rue broached this matter to the Council and upon his
                            return to Haiti, the further discussions were confided to M. Lescot. M.
                            Lescot did not press the matter with the Council, presumably because he
                            foresaw that a partial default in the interest payments by Haiti would
                            prejudice the possibility of a liberalization of our financial control
                            in Haiti which he hopes to bring about if he becomes president.</p>
                        <p>There the matter stood until two weeks ago when Mr. de la Rue, basing his
                            predictions on Haitian, re venues and expenditures during the first
                            three months of the present fiscal year (October 1–September 30),
                            forecast a prospective deficit at the end of the fiscal year of
                            $135,000. Basing their action on this small estimated deficit, the
                            Legation at Port-au-Prince and Mr. de la Rue have been pressing hard to
                            bring about the reduction in interest rate on Haitian bonds which, if it
                            becomes effective, will approximately take care of the estimated
                            deficit. We are now informed that the Bondholders Council has approved
                            the proposed reduction. Meanwhile, in our telegram no. 28 of February 1
                                (annexed<note n="14" xml:id="d268fn14"><hi rend="italic">Ante</hi>,
                                    <ref target="#pg_325">p. 325</ref>.</note>), we have put it
                            squarely up to the Haitian Government to decide whether it wishes to
                            proceed with the reduction even if it should prejudice the possibility
                            of a modification of our financial control in that country. President
                            Vincent has as yet come to no decision although we have no doubt that
                            Mr. de la Rue will urge the reduction.</p>
                        <p>It is possible that the approval of the Foreign Bondholders Protective
                            Council was obtained because they preferred this reduction plus
                            maintenance of our present fiscal control to maintenance of the interest
                            rate plus the possibility that the Department would proceed in due
                            course to liberalize our control in Haiti as it has done in the
                            Dominican Republic.</p>
                        <p>In case the Haitian Government should choose to proceed with the
                            reduction, the operation will, in all probability, have to be
                            consummated by an accord between the United States and the Haitian
                            Governments modifying the Accord of 1933. This accord would be an
                            executive agreement and would not have to be submitted to the Senate for
                            its consideration. It would, however, be published at once in Haiti and
                            doubtless the fact that this Government assented to the reduction would
                            become public knowledge in this country.</p>

                            this reduction in the interest rate. As the situation stands at present,

                            the Foreign Bondholders’ Protective Council. Therefore the Haitian
                            Government desires to conclude a supplementary executive agreement to
                            that effect. Subsequent to the conclusion of this agreement it plans to
                            carry on negotiations with the Council for a definitive reduction in the
                            interest rate.</p>

                        <p>35. Legation’s 31 [<hi rend="italic">20</hi>] of February 6 and your
                            telephone conversation with Finley, February 6, regarding postponement
                            of the payment of one-third the interest on Haitian bonds.</p>
                        <p>The Department believes that it would be desirable for the Haitian
                            Government to formalize its desire for a postponement in a note
                            addressed to you which would set forth the circumstances, enclose copies
                            of correspondence which has passed between the Haitian Government and
                            the Foreign Bondholders Protective Council, and suggest that the two
                            Governments reach an accord modifying the Accord of 1933 so far as to
                            permit the Fiscal Representative to postpone the remittance to the
                            Fiscal Agents of one-third the interest due on the April 1 and October
                            1, 1941 coupons.</p>
                        <p>The Department will telegraph you the text of the proposed accord at an
                            early date.</p>
                        <p>Since the Department, in the interest of the credit of the Haitian
                            Government, attaches considerable importance to the terms by which the
                            conclusion of this accord is announced to the public, it will also
                            forward you the text of a proposed press release which could be given
                            out simultaneously in Haiti and in this country after the signing of the
                            accord.</p>
                        <p>Please inform the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Finance to this effect
                            and say that the Department confidently trusts that the Haitian
                            Government will be willing to withhold publicity concerning this
                            postponement until the text and the time of the press release has been
                            mutually agreed upon between the two Governments.</p>

                        <p>67. In case of his election as President “which now seems a certainty”
                            Lescot would like to go to Washington as soon after April 15 as
                            practicable to return May 15. He would like to discuss with Department
                            further economic aid to Haiti and Inter-American defense problems. He
                            indicated that he would like a suggestion to this effect to come from
                            Washington giving as a pretext consideration to President Vincent.</p>

                        <p>M. Lescot stated that in the first place, he wished to assure the
                            Department of his Government’s desire to give the United States
                            unlimited cooperation. He intimated that all of Haiti’s forces and
                            facilities were at the disposal of this Government; that any plans which
                            this Government may have in mind in connection with defense would be
                            most carefully considered by his Government and with the greatest
                            sympathy.</p>

                                Setup.</hi></p>
                        <p>M. Lescot said that his Government was most anxious to have the present
                            fiscal setup in Haiti modified while at the same time giving full
                            guarantees to the bondholders. He said that the National Bank of the
                            Republic of Haiti had been purchased from the National City Bank for the
                            express purpose of having transferred to the bank the functions of the
                            Office of the Fiscal Representative. He hoped that this could now be
                            carried out, adding that he was not very familiar with the technical
                            aspects of the matter. He hoped, however, that it could be accomplished
                            in a way which would not “mortify” his country, and that he hoped we
                            would make some effort to “sugarcoat the pill”.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Duggan said it would be satisfactory to this Government to proceed at
                            once to study this matter and that he hoped the Department could present
                            M. Lescot with an outline of a plan for such a reorganization on
                            Saturday morning, April 26. If such an outline proved acceptable in
                            principle, we could then proceed as soon as possible to the conclusion
                            of a formal agreement. In the meanwhile, M. Lescot would be in a
                            position to announce upon his return to Haiti that the two Governments

                        <p>The discussion was opened by some observations by Messieurs Lescot and
                            Dennis regarding the ten-point memorandum for discussion which was
                            handed them.<note n="26" xml:id="d281fn26">Annex printed
                                herewith.</note> The first point to be questioned was the treatment
                            which would be accorded communal revenues by the National Bank of the
                            Republic of Haiti. It was suggested that the Bank might exercise a
                            certain measure of control over the communal revenues and would also
                            make or supervise the ordinary expenditures of the communes, retaining
                            in the National Treasury, through the Bank, any residue.</p>
                        <p>M. Lescot in commenting on point 6) stated that it was his belief that
                            any funds that were left over after the interest and amortization were
                            paid on the 1922 loan should be placed at the disposal of the Government
                            (there is no provision in point 6) which would forbid <pb n="335"
                                xml:id="pg_335" facs="0343"/>such a practice). Mr. Duggan suggested
                            that after there had been some time to look over the ten points, a
                            further discussion should be helpful and might be held on Monday, April
                            28. President-elect Lescot said that at first view the plan looked quite
                            attractive.</p>
                        <p>In answer to a question by Mr. Finley, M. Dennis said that he thought the
                            plan outlined in point 5) to centralize in the Bank the various fiscal
                            and budgetary functions was a good one. It was agreed that there would
                            be further discussion on Monday regarding the make-up of the official
                            personnel of the Bank.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Bressman then outlined the results of the study of the rubber mission
                            which had recently returned from Haiti. He said that Haiti was one of
                            two places in the Western Hemisphere in which the Department of
                            Agriculture wished to go forward with its experiments and development of
                            rubber production. This would be a long-term program and Dr. Bressman
                            added that it would be six or seven years before returns would come in;
                            he hoped that 90% of the rubber lands would be developed by the peasants
                            and that other products, such as bananas, cacao and subsistence crops
                            should be developed along with the rubber project.</p>
                        <p>M. Lescot added that plants capable of producing essential oils or
                            perfumes might be developed. Dr. Bressman replied that these
                            possibilities were being explored. M. Lescot repeated his plans for the
                            National Bank to finance a movement of unemployed from the city to the
                            country and to establish them on self-sufficient small farms. Dr.
                            Bressman replied that while he felt that it was perhaps asking too much
                            of the new agricultural development to be handicapped by attempting to
                            work out its plan with non-agriculturists, he did hope that the rubber
                            development would help both the rural people and the town dwellers. Dr.
                            Bressman added that the return per acre in a good rubber project should
                            range betwen $60 to $100 per year. President-elect Lescot asked Dr.
                            Bressman for a memorandum describing the program that he had in mind and
                            the methods of putting it into effect.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed to meet again on Monday.</p>

                            the bases for discussion it might be possible to work out a detailed
                            system of accounts in the National Bank of the Republic of Haiti for the
                            communes. Each commune would have a special account and its budget and
                            expenditures would thus be subject to a certain amount of supervision by
                            the Bank and by the national government.</p>
                        <p>President Lescot then went on to the question of payment on the bonds and
                            the expenses of the bank. He suggested that if there were a surplus in
                            any one month over the budget expenditures and one-twelfth of the annual
                            payment for the bonds, the directors of the Bank would decide what
                            portion of the surplus to set aside in order to establish reserves for
                            lean months and what portion to set aside <pb n="337" xml:id="pg_337"
                                facs="0345"/>for additional amortization payments. M. Lescot also
                            suggested that the directors of the Bank might fix the global budget and
                            that subsequently transfers could be made by the different departments
                            of the government according to exigencies that might come up. He added
                            that he felt that certain items which had previously been annually
                            budgeted, such as traveling expenses for the president, allowances for
                            the celebration of national holidays, et cetera, might well be omitted
                            from the regular budget and when such expenditures would be needed they
                            could be made from the reserved funds mentioned above.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> Although M. Lescot made a very attractive
                            presentation of this idea, it might be considered as the opening wedge
                            in the breakdown of the regular budget system.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Collado commented that the question of transfer of accounts within
                            the global budget was a matter of bookkeeping details and appeared to
                            allow for a certain amount of flexibility. He saw no objection to it in
                            principle, nor to the setting up of reserves in good months which should
                            ease the situation when seasonal fluctuations in government revenues
                            appeared.</p>
                        <p>President Lescot then mentioned the additional $500,000 which the Haitian
                            government expected would be made available for a continuation of the J.
                            G. White projects. Messrs. Bonsal and Collado pointed out that the
                            directors of the Export-Import Bank had not yet passed on the $500,000
                            and while it was hoped that favorable action could be obtained there was
                            nothing definitive to be said on that point today.</p>
                        <p>M. Lescot then reviewed the question of the construction of tourist
                            hotels and the advantages that would accrue to Haiti in the event of an
                            increased tourist trade. At this juncture he repeated his suggestion
                            that a highway be constructed from Môle St. Nicolas to Cap-Haïtien and
                            that this route, continued to Port-au-Prince and connected with a
                            highway to the Dominican frontier, would permit tourists to make a tour
                            of the island. Mr. Fennell stated that as he understood it, the J. G.
                            White program already had plans for an expenditure of an additional
                            $250,000 for road building if the additional $500,000 were made
                            available. Mr. Fennell stated that if the proposed agricultural
                            corporation should develop rubber some additional feeder roads would be
                            needed in the rubber producing areas.</p>
                        <p>M. Lescot said that he had been reading in the press about defense
                            activities of the United States in other islands of the Caribbean and to
                            him it was “shocking” that apparently the United States was taking no
                            defense measures in the Republic of Haiti. He would like to find out
                            what the defense program of the United States would have in store for
                            his country. Mr. Bonsal replied that this matter was being <pb n="338"
                                xml:id="pg_338" facs="0346"/>studied but that there was nothing to
                            be said about it at the present time beyond the fact that approximately
                            $200,000 was going to be expended in the improvement of Bowen Field.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Bonsal suggested that the Department might issue a statement which
                            would cover in principle the following points: <list>

                            </list></p>
                        <p>After MM. Lescot and Dennis left a further brief consultation was held in
                            which it was agreed that Dr. Bressman and Mr. Fennell would prepare the
                            section of the statement which would deal with agricultural plans, and
                            would prepare a more detailed memorandum which could be handed to M.
                            Lescot before he left the country.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Collado felt that it would be necessary to get Mr. Jesse Jones’<note
                                n="28" xml:id="d282fn28">Federal Loan Administrator and Secretary of
                                Commerce.</note> approval of the statements regarding the
                            agricultural plan as well as the Export-Import Bank credit. Mr. Finley
                            expressed as his opinion, which was concurred in by Mr. Collado, that
                            the matter of the hotel construction and management should be developed
                            further, although they did not see the necessity for some of the road
                            building plans that M. Lescot had proposed. Mr. Barber suggested the
                            possibility that the statement might take the form of a White House
                            press release, or a joint statement issued by Presidents Roosevelt and
                            Lescot.</p>

                        <p>M. Lescot opened the meeting by discussing briefly some of the points in
                            a memorandum, copy of which is attached.<note n="29" xml:id="d283fn29"
                                >Not printed.</note> Mr. Finley <pb n="339" xml:id="pg_339"
                                facs="0347"/>observed that there appeared to be a difference between
                            M. Lescot’s memorandum and the earlier “Bases of Discussion” regarding
                            the preparation and control of the budget. A general conversation ensued
                            during which President Lescot stated that the Haitian government could
                            not be placed in the position of losing its sovereignty by subjecting
                            itself to a veto over budget matters by the Directors of the National
                            Bank. Mr. Barber pointed out that there did not appear to be any loss of
                            sovereignty, as the Bank was a part of the government of Haiti and the
                            question of arranging the budget would be a matter of cooperation and
                            coordination of efforts of one branch of the government, that is, the
                            Ministry of Finance, and another branch, namely, the National Bank.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Collado thought that it might be possible to establish an arrangement
                            whereby the chief responsibility for the revenue side of the budget
                            would be placed upon the Bank and the chief responsibility for the
                            expenditure side of the budget would be placed upon the Finance
                            Minister. Of course it would be necessary for the two to agree upon a
                            final project of a law which would go through the usual procedure and
                            would be submitted to the legislature. Mr. Finley referred to the
                            language appearing in Article 13 of the Accord of 1933 as describing the
                            function of the Bank in preparing the estimates for the budget. M.
                            Lescot felt that the language of that article approximated his idea of
                            the new setup closer than the outlined point five of the bases of
                            discussion.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Bonsal suggested that a substitute for point five (<hi rend="italic"
                                >a</hi>) be found. Mr. Collado left the room to dictate the new
                            formula, copy of which is attached,<note n="30" xml:id="d283fn30">Not
                                printed.</note> which was then the subject of further discussions.
                            It was suggested that throughout the new formula the phrase “the
                            Minister of Finance” might be substituted for the phrase “Government of
                            Haiti” in order to bear out the thought that an agreement regarding
                            budget matters was being reached within the Haitian government. After a
                            further exchange of views, Mr. Bonsal intimated that details could be
                            arranged later after an agreement had been reached in principle
                            regarding the main point at issue.</p>
                        <p>M. Dennis thought that it would be preferable to have the Minister of
                            Finance named as the official responsible for the transmission of the
                            funds for the service of the bonds rather than the Board of Directors of
                            the National Bank. This change would be made, for example, in point six
                            of the “Bases for Discussion”.</p>
                        <p>After considerable further discussion it was agreed that: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>

                                    be fixed by the Haitian government and the salaries of the
                                    American members would be arranged by an accord between the two
                                    governments.</item>

                        <p>M. Lescot had no further objection to any of the other points of “Bases
                            of Discussion”.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Collado pointed out that it was expected that the American members of
                            the board of directors of the Bank would also perform other functions,
                            such as manager of the commercial division, and that each American
                            director would be a full time official of the Bank.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Finley passed around copies of the draft of a press release which
                            would summarize the agreement in principle which had been reached
                            regarding the National Bank, the abolition of the Office of the Fiscal
                            Representative, et cetera. A few minor changes in phraseology were
                            suggested, but no final decision was taken as to when the press
                            statement would be issued.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Collado then explained that the officials of the Export-Import Bank,
                            and specifically Secretary of Commerce Jones, were currently studying
                            the proposed Export-Import Bank credit and that he hoped a decision
                            would be reached in order to inform President-elect Lescot when he
                            returned to the Department tomorrow morning. Another press release would
                            be prepared on this subject giving in general outline (if the Bank
                            approves) the agricultural development plan prepared by Messrs. Bressman
                            and Fennell and additional extension of credits for the J. G. White
                            program. It was agreed to meet again on Wednesday morning.</p>

                        <p>At Mr. Duggan’s request Mr. Finley outlined the points which had been
                            discussed in the Department with President-elect Lescot and Foreign
                            Minister Dennis during their recent conversations in Washington. During
                            and following this explanation Mr. White asked the following questions: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>Would the Board of Directors of the Bank have control over
                                    customs?</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>Would all decisions of the Board of Directors be by vote of
                                    five members?</item>
                                <pb n="344" xml:id="pg_344" facs="0352"/>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>Would the Accord of 1933 be changed by an executive agreement
                                    or by a treaty?</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>Would the appointment of the Board of Directors be by joint
                                    accord of the two Governments?</item>
                                <label>5.</label>
                                <item>Who would be the personnel of the Board of Directors and who
                                    would be the Co-Presidents of the Bank?</item>
                                <label>6.</label>
                                <item>Would the new accord lapse with the retirement of the
                                    bonds?</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>Mr. White was informed that the Board of Directors would exercise
                            supervision over customs matters and that decisions of the Board would
                            be taken with the approval of five members. He was also told that it was
                            not yet known whether the new agreement would have to take the form of a
                            treaty. It was also stated that the appointment of the American members
                            of the Board of Directors was to be by the joint accord of the two
                            Governments. Mr. Duggan was certain that there would be no difficulty in
                            reaching agreement on the designation of the American members. Regarding
                            the personnel of the Directorate, several names were mentioned but it
                            was stated that no definite arrangements had yet been made. It was also
                            expected that the new agreement would terminate upon the retirement of
                            the bonds.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Finley also pointed out that under the new plan, it was felt that
                            there would be a more efficient handling of communal budgets which would
                            be under the supervision of the Bank, and that in this way as well as in
                            the expected impetus to Haiti’s economy arising out of the new
                            agricultural plan, it was felt that the bondholders’ prospects were
                            favorable. Mr. White said that his chief request, which if accepted
                            would bring about the approval of the Bondholders’ Council, would be a
                            provision to the effect that if the new system broke down and interest
                            payments to the bondholders were not made, that there should be a
                            reversion to the <hi rend="italic">status quo ante</hi>. Mr. Barber
                            inquired if Mr. White meant by this a reestablishment of the Office of
                            the Fiscal Representative. Mr. White replied in the affirmative. Mr.
                            Collado inquired if Mr. White had in mind a reversion to the previous
                            system in case (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) the administration of the new
                            plan were ineffective, or if (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) the general
                            economic situation or the Haitian fiscal situation did not permit bond
                            payments to be met. Mr. White intimated that he was really aiming at
                            point (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>).</p>
                        <p>Mr. White also raised the question, although he apparently considered it
                            as of secondary importance, as to whether or not bonds now held by the
                            Haitian Government could be disposed of in order to make up for the
                            amortization payments which had not been made in the last two or three
                            years. He also expressed the hope that means would soon be found to
                            restore the amortization payments.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion Mr. Duggan and Mr. Collado said that careful consideration
                            would be given to Mr. White’s suggestion. It was <pb n="345"
                                xml:id="pg_345" facs="0353"/>thought that with President Lescot just
                            being inaugurated and as the new Haitian Minister had not yet arrived in
                            Washington a month’s time might elapse before serious conversations
                            would again be held.</p>

                            Department will wish to prepare a draft agreement based on the
                            memorandum agreed to at the time of Lescot’s visit to Washington, which
                            would be submitted to the Haitians only after your observations, and
                            those of other interested parties, have been received and considered.
                            Accordingly, the precise date on which discussions are to begin cannot
                            be fixed with certainty at the present time although the Department is
                            giving the matter current attention with a view to proceeding
                            promptly.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Reference is made to the Department’s
                            telegram no. 127 of June 10, 1941, and previous correspondence regarding
                            the agreement which was reached in principle on April 30, 1941 for a
                            revision of the Accord of August 7, 1933. Subject to the preliminary
                            steps hereinafter mentioned, the Department stands ready to conclude an
                            executive agreement with the Government of Haiti along the lines of that
                            agreement in principle.</p>
                        <p>There are enclosed for your information and consideration three copies of
                            a draft of a new executive agreement styled “Draft D, July 7,
                                1941”.<note n="33" xml:id="d289fn33">Not printed.</note> You are
                            requested to transmit to the Department by air mail as soon as
                            practicable your views on the provisions of this draft agreement
                            together with those of Mr. Williams of the National Bank of the Republic
                            of Haiti. As the enclosed draft does not have the approval of this
                            Department for submission to the Haitian Government for negotiation, you
                            will please make it clear to Mr. Williams that the document is shown to
                            him in strict confidence and its contents should not be divulged to
                            anyone.</p>
                        <p>You will note that in Articles II and III it is provided that the Haitian
                            Government will enact and maintain legislation and executive and
                            administrative regulations necessary to put the provisions of the new
                            agreement into force. You are requested to submit a statement regarding
                            such legislation and regulations as may, in your opinion and that of Mr.
                            Williams, be appropriate for this purpose. In this connection will you
                            please recommend those measures which you believe to be necessary to be
                            enacted before the signing of the executive agreement, and those which
                            should be enacted simultaneously with or subsequent to the signing of
                            the agreement. However at the present time it is not desired to bring
                            this, or any other aspect of the proposed agreement to the attention of
                            the Haitian Government.</p>
                        <p>In the enclosed draft additions have been introduced into the “Bases of
                            Discussion” of April 30 in order to clarify certain points, notably the
                            statement in Article VII that the bonds of the 1922 loan constitute an
                            irrevocable first lien upon all Haitian Government revenues, and that
                            until the amortization of the bonds has been completed the public debt
                            of the Republic of Haiti shall not be increased except by previous
                            agreement between the Governments of the United States and Haiti. It is
                            felt that this article should be satisfactory to the Haitian Government
                            in lieu of the several provisions of the accord of August <pb n="347"
                                xml:id="pg_347" facs="0355"/>7, 1933 which tend to limit the freedom
                            of action of the Haitian Government in this regard.</p>
                        <p>The stipulation in Article VIII to the effect that there shall be applied
                            to the sinking fund for the redemption of bonds for the 1922 loan, 10%
                            of Haitian Government revenues in excess of $7,000,000 is for the
                            purpose of increasing the benefits to the bond holders in the event of
                            improved revenues by the Haitian Government. The benefits which would
                            obviously accrue to the Haitian Government as the amortization payments
                            are increased and the life of the loan is reduced, do not require
                            comment.</p>
                        <p>The Department is of the opinion that it will not be necessary or
                            desirable to mention in the proposed executive agreement the notes held
                            by the Export-Import Bank of Washington. The guarantee made by the
                            Haitian Government in connection with the notes issued for the J. G.
                            White Engineering Company’s credit, as well as the guarantee by the
                            Haitian Government of the notes which are expected to be issued by the
                            proposed Haitian-American Agricultural Development Corporation
                            constitute a positive pledge of the Haitian Government in respect to
                            such credits.</p>
                        <p>It is felt that such questions as the amount of Directors’ fees, the
                            names of the members of the Board of Directors and other details of the
                            organization and administration of the National Bank of the Republic of
                            Haiti may appropriately be agreed upon by separate exchanges of notes.
                            Any further observations which you may care to make on these questions
                            in addition to those made in your despatches 115 and 132 of May 20 and
                            29, 1941,<note n="34" xml:id="d289fn34">Neither printed.</note>
                            respectively, will be given full consideration by the Department.</p>
                        <p>As the Haitian fiscal year closes on September 30 it is hoped that the
                            preparation of the proposed agreement will be expedited in order that it
                            may be presented to the Haitian Government and be put into effect, and
                            that the Office of the Fiscal Representative be terminated by that
                            date.</p>
                        <p>Very truly yours,</p>

                        <p>The terms of the Agreement and of the notes have received the concurrence
                            of the Haitian Minister of Finance, M. Abel Lacroix, and the Haitian
                            Minister to the United States, M. Fernand Dennis. The discussions
                            conducted by the Department with these officials have been most amicable
                            and satisfactory.</p>

                            after you have compared the French text, prepared by the Haitian
                            Government, with the English, and are satisfied with the accuracy of the
                            translation, you are authorized, in behalf of this Government, to sign
                            the Agreement, drawn up in both languages, and to exchange the notes in
                            question.</p>
                        <p>This instruction may be exhibited to the Haitian Foreign Minister as your

                            despatches nos. 340, 347, 349 and 373 of August 25, 27 and 28, and

                            September 10,<note n="40" xml:id="d296fn40">None printed.</note> with
                            regard to a proposed commercial convention between Haiti and the
                            Dominican Republic.</p>
                        <p>After reviewing the unofficial text of the proposed convention as
                            reported by the Legation, it is the opinion of the Department that it
                            contains no provisions which would specifically prevent the Government
                            of Haiti from fulfilling its obligations to the United States under the
                            most-favored-nation clause of the trade agreement with this country.</p>
                        <pb n="351" xml:id="pg_351" facs="0359"/>
                        <p>However, it is noted from the despatches under reference that certain
                            statements were made to you by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Haiti,
                            and by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Dominican Republic,
                            implying that the proposed convention was being negotiated in accordance
                            with a contractual formula for preferential customs treatment to
                            contiguous countries recommended by the Inter-American Financial and
                            Economic Advisory Committee. This formula, which was recommended by the
                            Advisory Committee on September 18, 1941, provides in substance that any
                            tariff preferences between contiguous countries must be made effective
                            through trade agreements embodying tariff reductions or exemptions; that
                            the parties to such agreements must reserve the right to reduce or
                            eliminate the customs duties on like imports from other countries; and
                            that any such regional tariff preferences should not be allowed to stand
                            in the way of any broad program of economic reconstruction involving the
                            reduction of tariffs and the scaling down or elimination of tariff and
                            other trade preferences, with a view to the fullest possible development
                            of international trade on a multilateral unconditional
                            most-favored-nation basis.</p>
                        <p>The statements made to you by the two Foreign Ministers lead the
                            Department to believe that the Haitian Government has misunderstood the
                            nature and significance of the formula outlined above and may therefore
                            intend to withhold from imports of similar products originating in the
                            United States the tariff reductions to be accorded by Haiti under the
                            proposed convention to certain imports from the Dominican Republic.</p>
                        <p>If you learn upon inquiry that such is the intention of the Haitian
                            Government, you are requested to bring to the attention of the Haitian
                            Foreign Minister the following points: <list>
                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>In the opinion of the Government of the United States, the
                                    contractual formula for tariff preferences between contiguous
                                    countries recommended by the Inter-American Financial and
                                    Economic Advisory Committee does not automatically qualify the
                                    most-favored-nation provisions of existing treaties or
                                    agreements between the United States and any of the other

                            intention to negotiate a trade agreement with Argentina of May 13, 1941,
                            the Argentine Government requested that preferential tariff treatment
                            accorded by it to contiguous countries be exempted from the scope of the
                            most-favored-nation clause, and in support of its request called to the

                            International Conference of American States at Montevideo, approved

                        <p>Although extremely reluctant to agree to relax in any way the application
                            of the unconditional most-favored-nation principle, this Government
                            indicated that, in the light of its approval of Resolution LXXX, it
                            would accede, under certain conditions, to the Argentine request.
                            Agreement was finally reached to effect an exchange of notes
                            simultaneously with the conclusion of the trade agreement, providing
                            that if, pursuant to Resolution LXXX, the Inter-American Financial and
                            Economic Advisory Committee should recommend a contractual formula for
                            preferences to contiguous countries identical with the one submitted to
                            that Committee on July 31, 1941 jointly by the Governments of Argentina
                            and Brazil, the Government of the United States would not invoke the
                            provisions of Article I (unconditional most-favored-nation treatment) of
                            the proposed trade agreement between the United States and Argentina for
                            the purpose of obtaining the benefit of tariff preferences conforming to
                            the contractual formula which Argentina might accord to a contiguous
                            country. <pb n="353" xml:id="pg_353" facs="0361"/>However, this
                            agreement on the part of the United States was conditional upon the
                            inclusion in a Final Minute of the negotiations assurances by the
                            Argentine Government that, prior to according any such preference with
                            respect to any product of interest to the United States, it would in
                            practice afford the Government of the United States adequate opportunity
                            for consultation. Furthermore, in the draft exchange of notes the
                            understanding was recorded “that if any such preference should be
                            extended by Argentina to any noncontiguous country it would be extended
                            immediately and unconditionally to the United States.”</p>

                            report that an opportunity was afforded me yesterday afternoon in a
                            conversation with President Lescot to inquire as to the present status
                            of the convention. The President replied that nothing further had
                            developed but that he intended to send officially to the Legation a copy
                            of the Convention for the comment of the American Government. He
                            explained that he had no direct interest in the consummation of the
                            agreement but that the Dominicans desired it and were pressing him for
                            action. I inquired if it had been his thought that the advantages
                            granted to the Dominican Republic as a contiguous country would be
                            withheld from like products originating in the United States. President
                            Lescot replied that it had been his understanding that this was the
                            purpose of the Resolution at the Montevideo Conference, as amplified at
                            later meetings, particularly those of the Inter-American Financial and
                            Economic Advisory Committee. I informed President Lescot that I would
                            furnish the Minister for Foreign Affairs with information on this aspect
                            of the question. However, it occurred to me that the <pb n="354"
                                xml:id="pg_354" facs="0362"/>more serious aspect, as concerned
                            Haiti, was whether or not it was in a position to relinquish
                            approximately 1,000,000 gourdes per annum of its customs receipts.</p>
                        <p>In a conversation this morning with the Minister for Foreign Affairs
                            relative to the reported closing of the Honorary Danish Consulate at
                            Gonaives, I took the opportunity to refer to the Commercial Convention
                            between the Republic of Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Minister
                            Fombrun stated categorically that when the Convention had been signed he
                            had made it clear to the Dominican negotiators that it was an <hi
                                rend="italic">ad referendum</hi> agreement—namely that before it
                            could be ratified by Haiti it would be necessary to obtain the approval
                            of the Haitian Congress and to consult with the Government of the United
                            States with regard to its effects upon Haitian finances. He showed to me
                            a note which he addressed on this subject to the Haitian Minister in
                            Port-au-Prince in the first days of September confirming this
                            understanding. He added that in these circumstances the Haitian
                            Government has treated the Convention as a secret agreement and has
                            given it no publicity, and that the consultations to date have been
                            purely informal (<hi rend="italic">officieux</hi>) and not official. He
                            will, however, submit the Convention officially to the National Bank for
                            approval. It will be of interest to the Department that Minister Fombrun
                            recognized the necessity of obtaining the approval of the National Bank
                            before ratification could be made.</p>
                        <p>I also inquired of Minister Fombrun whether it was his intention to
                            withhold from imports of similar products originating in the United
                            States the tariff reductions to be accorded by Haiti under the
                            Convention to certain imports from the Dominican Republic. Minister
                            Fombrun also referred to the Resolution at the Montevideo Conference and
                            to subsequent resolutions and actions the intention of which appeared to
                            him to warrant some relaxation in the application of the unconditional
                            most-favored-nation clause as concerns the interchange of products
                            between contiguous countries. I pointed out to him that it was the
                            opinion of my Government that the contractual formula for tariff
                            preferences between contiguous countries recommended by the
                            Inter-American Financial and Economic Advisory Committee does not
                            automatically qualify the most-favored-nation provision in the Trade
                            Agreement between the United States and Haiti and, therefore, my
                            Government would expect compliance with the existing trade arrangements
                            between our two countries. I added that it was my understanding,
                            however, that there had been a departure in the recent agreement
                            concluded between the United States and Argentina with respect to the
                            strict application of the unconditional most-favored-nation clause in
                            the trade arrangements <pb n="355" xml:id="pg_355" facs="0363"/>between
                            Argentina and contiguous countries. In these circumstances, my
                            Government would expect that Haiti would consult with it before
                            undertaking to extend preferential tariff treatment to any articles
                            imported from the Dominican Republic, and it would be prepared to give
                            earnest consideration to such proposals as the Haitian Government might
                            wish to make. I agreed to furnish the Foreign Minister with a memorandum
                            on this subject which I will do tomorrow, a copy of which is enclosed
                                herewith.<note n="45" xml:id="d297fn45">Not printed.</note></p>
                        <p>I then informed Minister Fombrun that while my Government would be
                            prepared to give earnest consideration to such proposals as the Haitian
                            Government might wish to make with reference to the unconditional
                            most-favored-nation obligations in the Haitian-American Trade Agreement,
                            it seemed to me that the possible effects upon Haitian revenues of the
                            Commercial Convention between Haiti and the Dominican Republic merited a
                            serious and detailed study. I recalled that the preliminary study made
                            by Mr. Pixley<note n="46" xml:id="d297fn46">Rex A. Pixley, Deputy Fiscal
                                Representative of Haiti. The preliminary study referred to, dated

                                despatch No. 373, September 5, not printed.</note> had revealed that
                            the operation of the Commercial Convention would involve a diminution in
                            Haitian customs revenues of slightly more than 1,000,000 gourdes. I
                            added that if the American Government consented to the modification of
                            the rights granted by the unconditional most-favored-nation clause in
                            the Haitian-American Trade Agreement, it was conceivable that the
                            preferential tariff treatment accorded like articles from the Dominican
                            Republic would, to a great extent at least, shift the source of supply
                            of those articles from the United States to the Dominican Republic. Thus
                            there would be entailed the same loss of slightly more than 1,000,000
                            gourdes of Haitian customs duties as would be the case if the United
                            States insisted upon compliance with its present trade agreement
                            arrangements. I further pointed out that in these circumstances it would
                            be necessary to reduce by a corresponding amount the estimate of
                            revenues for the current fiscal year. I added in this connection that my
                            conversations with the Co-President of the National Bank seemed to
                            indicate that this would not be possible if the Haitian Government
                            proceeded with the restoration of the salary discounts in effect during
                            the past fiscal year. Moreover, it did not appear that there were any
                            other immediately available sources of revenue which might replace the
                            reduction in import duties which must be expected. Minister Fombrun had
                            no suggestions to offer.</p>
                        <p>During the course of the conversation, the Foreign Minister mentioned
                            that the Minister for Finance, Abel Lacroix, was very opposed <pb
                                n="356" xml:id="pg_356" facs="0364"/>to the Commercial Convention on
                            the grounds that Haiti could little afford to relinquish approximately
                            1,000,000 gourdes of its revenues from customs duties. He also stated
                            that the Dominican reductions on empty sisal bags was simply in
                            anticipation of the establishment in Haiti at some future date of a
                            factory for the manufacture of sisal bags for coffee and possibly sugar.
                            As concerns the concession on Haitian rum, he admitted that this would
                            affect only the superior grades of Haitian rum the production of which
                            is very small. In this connection also, he was not certain as to whether
                            the “15 centimes”, or in Spanish “15 centavos”, meant three cents
                            American or fifteen cents American. The other articles upon which Haiti
                            would receive preferential treatment do not appear to be of any
                            considerable importance.</p>
                        <p>I later discussed the matter with Mr. Williams of the National Bank who
                            confirmed that the Minister for Finance opposed the Commercial
                            Convention on the grounds that Haiti could not afford to relinquish such
                            a considerable amount of its customs revenues. Mr. Williams was not
                            familiar with the terms of the agreement, but he stated categorically
                            that he was unable to see how the National Bank could give its agreement
                            to the ratification of the Convention.</p>
                        <p>The difficulty of the situation is that the Dominican authorities are
                            pressing for ratification—so much so that, according to the Foreign
                            Minister, the convention has already been approved by the Dominican
                            Congress, and the Dominican Government is now prepared to exchange
                            ratifications. Apparently, the Dominican Minister in Portau-Prince has
                            made frequent inquiries as to the status of the Convention and has urged
                            prompt action by Haiti. On the other hand, the Haitian Government
                            realizes how strongly the Dominicans desire the ratification of the
                            Convention and it is desirous of making some contribution to an
                            improvement in the commercial relations between the two countries. I
                            feel convinced that if the estimated contribution, in the sum of
                            1,000,000 gourdes, is to be made by reducing in this amount Government
                            salaries and operating expenses, the present attitude of reluctance upon
                            the part of the Haitian Government will become one of unwillingness.
                            However, as the situation now stands the responsibility for the failure
                            of Haiti to ratify the Convention is unfortunately and unfairly placed
                            squarely upon the United States.</p>
                        <p>I shall continue to report any conversations that I may have on this
                            subject.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With reference to my despatch no. 479 of
                            October 21, 1941, reporting my conversations with President Lescot and
                            Foreign Minister Fombrun relative to the Commercial Convention signed by
                            Haiti and the Dominican Republic, I have the honor to report that the
                            Foreign Minister showed to me this morning unofficially a draft of a
                            note that he wished to send me as soon as it had been approved by
                            President Lescot.</p>
                        <p>The note, as drafted, would submit officially to the American Legation a
                            copy of the Commercial Convention between Haiti and the Dominican
                            Republic for comment by the American Government with respect to the
                            unconditional most-favored-nation clause in the Haitian-American Trade
                            Agreement of March 28, 1935, in the light of the contractual formula
                            recommended by the Inter-American Financial and Economic Advisory
                            Committee on September 18, 1941. The note then refers to the fact that
                            Article XX of the Accord of August 7, 1933,<note n="47"
                                xml:id="d298fn47"><ref target="frus1933v05#pg_755"><hi rend="italic"

                            incorporated in the Executive Agreement signed on September 13,

                            Haitian Government does not consider that the preferential treatment

                            Republic is contrary to the Haitian-American Trade Agreement of March
                            28, 1935, nor that it is contrary to the provisions of the Executive
                            Agreement to Replace the Accord of August 7, 1933, signed on September
                            13, 1941.</p>
                        <p>I told the Foreign Minister that two problems would be presented, namely
                            (1) the attitude that the American Government might assume with respect
                            to the preferential treatment that Haiti proposed to grant the products
                            originating in the Dominican Republic vis-à-vis the unconditional
                            most-favored-nation treatment provided for in Article VII of the Trade
                            Agreement of March 28, 1935; and (2) the effects that the operation of
                            the Commercial Convention might have on Haitian fiscal revenues.</p>
                        <pb n="358" xml:id="pg_358" facs="0366"/>
                        <p>With regard to point one, I explained to the Foreign Minister that in my
                            memorandum of October 21, 1941,<note n="49" xml:id="d298fn49">Not
                                printed; the memorandum was based on Department’s instruction No.
                                224, October 7, <ref target="#pg_350">p. 350</ref>.</note>
                            (enclosure no. 1, despatch no. 479 of October 21, 1941) I had set forth
                            that my Government was prepared to give earnest consideration to such
                            proposals as the Haitian Government might wish to make, with reference
                            to the most-favored-nation obligations in the Trade Agreement with the
                            United States, in regard to the tariff preference it may desire to grant
                            on certain articles imported from the Dominican Republic. Therefore, if
                            the Foreign Minister addressed me on this point I would be pleased to
                            transmit his proposal to my Government for consideration. At this point
                            the Foreign Minister referred to the provision in paragraph 6 of Article
                            VII of the existing Trade Agreement relative to advantages accorded “to
                            adjacent countries in order to facilitate frontier traffic” and
                            expressed the view that this provision would seem to cover the point. I
                            reminded the Foreign Minister that in the Commercial Convention signed
                            between Haiti and the Dominican Republic there was a separate protocol
                            which referred exclusively to frontier traffic and that it was my
                            understanding that the paragraph in our Trade Agreement, quoted above,
                            covered only border exchanges of products. Also, in view of the
                            confusion under which the Foreign Minister seemed to labor with respect
                            to the recent exceptions made by the American Government in the Trade
                            Agreement concluded with Argentina with regard to preferential treatment
                            granted by the latter to contiguous countries, I pointed out that the
                            exception made in the exchange of notes between the two Governments,
                            which was pursuant to the contractual formula for tariff preference to
                            contiguous countries recommended on September 18, 1941, by the
                            Inter-American Financial and Economic Advisory Committee, was the result
                            of negotiations between the United States and Argentina. In the
                            contractual arrangements between the United States and Haiti provision
                            had not been made for such an exception and therefore it was necessary
                            that the Haitian Government should submit to the American Government for
                            its consideration such proposals as it might wish to make for tariff
                            preferences to the Dominican Republic.</p>
                        <p>With regard to point two, I expressed the personal view—since I had not
                            yet consulted my Government and had not yet been informed of its
                            views—that my Government would probably not wish to express an opinion
                            as to what effects the operation of the Commercial Convention between
                            Haiti and the Dominican Republic would have upon Haitian fiscal
                            revenues. I suggested that my Government would not necessarily have
                            sufficient information available to reach a conclusion as to the
                            economic effects nor might it be sufficiently informed as to <pb n="359"
                                xml:id="pg_359" facs="0367"/>the political advantages which the
                            Haitian Government might hope to derive from the operation of this
                            Commercial Convention. In these circumstances, again expressing my
                            purely personal views, I ventured to say that my Government would
                            suggest that this is a matter which might more properly be submitted to
                            the Board of Directors of the National Bank of the Republic of Haiti for
                            study and opinion.</p>
                        <p>At this point the Foreign Minister recalled that Article XX of the Accord
                            of August 7, 1933, relative to the powers exercised by the Fiscal
                            Representative, had been canceled and that a like provision had not been
                            included in the Executive Agreement of September 13, 1941. I agreed with
                            the Foreign Minister that “the language employed in Article XX of the
                            Accord of August 7, 1933, did not seem to be incorporated in the
                            Executive Agreement of September 13, 1941, for the reason that the two
                            Governments had decided to confer this duty of the Fiscal Representative
                            upon the Board of Directors of the National Bank consisting of three
                            American and three Haitian members,” In this connection I referred to
                            Article V of the Executive Agreement of September 13, 1941, which
                            required that the “budget shall be prepared cooperatively by the
                            Government of the Republic and by the National Bank of the Republic of
                            Haiti” in the manner described therein. Since the Board of Directors
                            must estimate the expected revenues and the global expenditures and
                            since the Government of the Republic must estimate the expenditures
                            “within the limits suggested by the Board of Directors of the National
                            Bank”, and since both estimates for the current fiscal year had been
                            made and agreed upon by the Government and the National Bank, it would
                            seem that the latter should be consulted before the consummation of the
                            Commercial Convention which, from preliminary investigations, would
                            entail a sizeable loss of Government revenues. I pointed out further
                            that if the Commercial Convention were consummated and it were
                            established that Haitian custom revenues were substantially reduced as a
                            result thereof, it would then be incumbent upon the National Bank to
                            take the steps necessary to reduce the expenditures of the Government so
                            as to bring them within the revenues that might be available. The
                            Foreign Minister argued that the operation of the Commercial Convention
                            would not impair the validity or the compliance of the Haitian
                            Government with its obligations to the bondholders since if it proved
                            that the loss of revenues were too great reductions could be made in
                            other expenditures of the Government and the Commercial Convention
                            itself could be denounced within a period of five or six months.</p>
                        <p>The difficulty in this whole problem is the fact that the Foreign
                            Minister is convinced that if the Commercial Convention were submitted
                            to the Board of Directors of the National Bank the latter <pb n="360"
                                xml:id="pg_360" facs="0368"/>would advise against ratification of
                            the Convention. I have been informed that Finance Minister Lacroix is
                            opposed to ratification of the Commercial Convention because of the
                            adverse effect which it would have on Haitian custom revenues. I am also
                            informed that Mr. Williams is opposed for the same reason and the fact
                            that he is unable to see how this loss of revenues might be replaced by
                            other sources. In these circumstances, I believe, Foreign Minister
                            Fombrun desires to obtain directly the consent and approval of the
                            American Government, then proceed with the ratification, and finally
                            present the measure to the National Bank as a <hi rend="italic">fait
                                accompli.</hi></p>
                        <p>I recognize fully the desirability and necessity of improving the
                            economic and political relations between the Republic of Haiti and the
                            Dominican Republic. I believe that the conclusion of a sound commercial
                            arrangement between the two countries might well contribute to an
                            improvement in those relations. However, I do believe that both the
                            spirit and the terms of the Executive Agreement of September 13, 1941,
                            might very well be vitiated if the American Government undertook,
                            without consultation with the Board of Directors of the National Bank of
                            the Republic of Haiti, to pass upon independently the possible effects
                            of the operation of the Commercial Convention on Haitian fiscal
                            revenues. Moreover, it would seem unfortunate if at the very inception
                            of the Executive Agreement of September 13, 1941, the Haitian Government
                            were unwilling to consult and work out with the National Bank a
                            commercial arrangement with the Dominican Republic which would reflect
                            not only the economic but the political aspirations of Haiti.</p>
                        <p>As I have indicated above, I confined myself to an expression of purely
                            personal views in the premises, for the reason, <hi rend="italic">inter
                                alia</hi>, that the Foreign Minister had consulted me purely
                            informally prior to obtaining the approval of President Lescot to submit
                            the Commercial Convention formally to the Legation for the opinion and
                            comment of the American Government. Two courses are now open. If the
                            Department agrees with the personal views expressed by me, I could
                            confirm them officially to the Foreign Minister and President Lescot and
                            thus possibly avoid the presentation of the contemplated note. This
                            would seem to be the best course so as to avoid the necessity at this
                            time formally to interpret the provisions of the Executive Agreement of
                            September 13, 1941. Certainly it seems to me that the question of the
                            economic and political advantages in the Commercial Convention between
                            Haiti and the Dominican Republic is a matter which should be thrashed
                            out by the Haitian Government with the Board of Directors of the
                            National Bank so that it may be fully informed of the possible
                            consequences that the Convention might cause.</p>

                            hand, the recommendation of the Inter-American Financial and Economic
                            Advisory Committee on the date of September 18, 1941, relative to tariff
                            preference between contiguous countries and, on the other hand, the
                            bilateral agreements existing between the United States of America and
                            Haiti, specificially the Trade Agreement of March 28, 1935, and the
                            Executive Agreement to Replace the Accord of August 7, 1933, and signed
                            on September 13, 1941, I have the honor to forward to your Legation a
                            copy of the Treaty of Commerce signed August 26, 1941, between the
                            Dominican Republic and the Republic of Haiti, requesting you to inform
                            me whether your Government is in accord with the Haitian Government with
                            regard to the terms (<hi rend="italic">conformité</hi>) of this
                            Treaty.</p>
                        <p>In this connection, it is pertinent to set forth that reservations had
                            been made verbally in the name of the Haitian Government upon the
                            signing of the Treaty in question and confirmed in writing September 8,
                            1941, to the Minister of the Dominican Republic in Port-au-Prince,
                            because of the financial agreements existing between the United States
                            and Haiti, rather than in consideration of the effects of the
                            most-favored-nation clause with respect to the tariff preference which
                            the two contracting countries reciprocally granted each other.</p>
                        <p>In effect, according to the terms of the Haitian-American Trade Agreement
                            of March 18 [<hi rend="italic">28</hi>], 1935, Article VII, paragraphs 6
                            and 7, the tariff preferences between contiguous countries do not fall
                            within the scope of the said agreement insofar as concerns the
                            application of the most-favored-nation clause, in accordance with the
                            spirit of the recommendation of the Inter-American Committee relative
                            thereto, provided that the granting of these preferences do not
                            eventually stand in the way of the execution of a general program of
                            economic reconstruction.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, you will wish to consider well that the reservations were made
                            and confirmed on the part of Haiti when Haitian-American financial
                            relations were still practically governed by the Accord of August 7,
                            1933, which required the agreement of the American Government for
                            modification of Haitian customs tariffs which might affect the guarantee
                            of the foreign debt contracted <pb n="362" xml:id="pg_362" facs="0370"
                            />in the United States. But the new system instituted by the Agreement
                            of September 13, 1941, substituting the National Bank of the Republic of
                            Haiti for the Fiscal Representative, has otherwise provided the
                            guarantee of the interest of the holders of the Haitian foreign debt and
                            does not contain a clause of this nature.</p>
                        <p>In these circumstances, it appears to the Haitian Government that the
                            provision of tariff preference to the Dominican Government is not
                            contrary to the recommendation of the Inter-American Advisory Committee,
                            at least for the time being, nor the Haitian-American Agreements of
                            March 28, 1935, and September 13, 1941, already mentioned.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, desiring to act with the American Government always in
                            perfect agreement as to views, the Haitian Government would like to know
                            the opinion or the observations of your Legation in this connection in
                            order to be able to comply with the formalities with a view to the
                            ratification of the diplomatic instrument under consideration.</p>

                        <p>It is the understanding of the Government of the United States that by

                            examination of the provisions of paragraphs six and seven of Article VII
                            of the trade agreement of March 28, 1935, between Haiti and the United

                            tariff preferences between contiguous countries, has led the Government
                            of Haiti to believe that the tariff reductions in accordance with the
                            treaty would not be subject to the most-favored-nation provisions of the
                            first paragraph of Article VII of the trade agreement, which require
                            that such tariff reductions be extended to like articles imported into
                            Haiti from the United States.</p>
                        <pb n="363" xml:id="pg_363" facs="0371"/>
                        <p>The Government of the United States is unable to find in the provisions
                            of the trade agreement cited by the Government of Haiti language which
                            would exempt from the scope of the most-favored-nation clause tariff
                            reductions granted by Haiti to the Dominican Republic.</p>
                        <p>Paragraph six of Article VII of the trade agreement provides as follows:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The advantages accorded or which may hereafter be accorded by

                        <p>The term “frontier traffic” in the paragraph quoted above is interpreted
                            by the Government of the United States, and by governments generally, to
                            mean local trade within a zone extending for a limited distance on each
                            side of the frontier for the benefit of the inhabitants of that zone.
                            Ordinarily the latter may not extend beyond 15 kilometers (10 miles) on
                            either side of the frontier, while the trade must be purely local trade
                            between the inhabitants of the zone in question for their own needs;
                            that is, the movement of goods must begin and end within the zone. Trade
                            with inhabitants of other portions of either country transacted within
                            the frontier zone or transacted by persons living in the zone, would not
                            be considered frontier traffic entitled to exemption from the
                            most-favored-nation clause.</p>
                        <p>This interpretation is in accord with the meaning given frontier traffic
                            in recommendations of the League of Nations approving the exemption of
                            such traffic from the most-favored-nation clause. In justifying such
                            exemption, the League’s recommendations state that “the strict
                            maintenance of a customs barrier between two adjacent countries is …
                            clearly hampering to the inhabitants of the frontier districts …<note
                                n="52" xml:id="d300fn52">Omissions indicated in the original
                                memorandum.</note> and an agreement allowing freedom of trade within
                            a restricted zone on each side of the frontier is justifiable.” With
                            reference to the extent of the zone, the League’s recommendations remark
                            that “some recent treaties allow a contiguous state certain favours with
                            a view to facilitating trade in particular frontier districts, not
                            extending as a rule beyond 15 kilometers on either side of the frontier,
                            besides granting privileges for the inhabitants of these districts”.</p>
                        <p>It is clear that the tariff reductions embodied in the Treaty of Commerce
                            between Haiti and the Dominican Republic are not advantages <pb n="364"
                                xml:id="pg_364" facs="0372"/>accorded to facilitate frontier traffic
                            as defined above, but relate to the trade between the entire territories
                            of each of the two countries, including sea-borne trade. This view is
                            confirmed by Article seven of the treaty making frontier traffic the
                            subject of an additional protocol, which protocol was signed on the same
                            day as the treaty.</p>
                        <p>Paragraph seven of Article VII of the trade agreement, also cited by the
                            Government of Haiti, likewise fails to exempt tariff reductions granted
                            by Haiti to products of the Dominican Republic from the
                            most-favored-nation clause of the trade agreement. This paragraph reads
                            as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The advantages now accorded or which may hereafter be accorded
                                    by the United States of America, its territories and possessions
                                    and the Panama Canal Zone to one another or to the Republic of
                                    Cuba shall be excepted from the operation of this Agreement. The
                                    provisions of this paragraph shall continue to apply in respect
                                    of any advantages now or hereafter accorded by the United States
                                    of America, its territories or possessions or the Panama Canal
                                    Zone to the Philippine Islands irrespective of any change that
                                    may take place in the political status of the Philippine
                                    Islands.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>This paragraph furnishes additional evidence that it was the intention of
                            the negotiators of the trade agreement to make certain that all
                            exceptions to the operation of the trade agreement would be expressly
                            stated therein. The failure to specify as an exception trade between
                            contiguous countries, other than frontier traffic, therefore, is further
                            evidence that there was no intention on the part of either Government to
                            except such trade.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the recommendation of the Inter-American Financial and
                            Economic Advisory Committee of September 18, 1941, relating to tariff
                            preferences between contiguous countries, it will be recalled that
                            recommendations of the Advisory Committee are not instruments having
                            legal force and effect, and consequently do not automatically qualify
                            the provisions of existing treaties or agreements between the
                            Governments of the American republics. Each Government must decide to
                            what extent and in what manner it wishes to adopt the recommendation in
                            practice. The Governments of Haiti and the United States are not,
                            therefore, released from their reciprocal obligations under the
                            most-favored-nation provisions of the trade agreement in respect of
                            trade between contiguous countries solely by virtue of the Advisory
                            Committee’s recommendation.</p>
                        <p>To summarize, it is the view of the Government of the United States that
                            trade between Haiti and the Dominican Republic is not excepted from the
                            operation of the trade agreement between the United States and Haiti,
                            either by provisions of the trade agreement <pb n="365" xml:id="pg_365"
                                facs="0373"/>itself or by virtue of the Advisory Committee’s
                            recommendation, but on the contrary, that under the most-favored-nation
                            provisions of the trade agreement, the United States is entitled to the
                            benefit of such tariff reductions as may be granted by Haiti to products
                            imported from the Dominican Republic or any other country.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, the Government of the United States recognizes the special
                            situation of trade between Haiti and the Dominican Republic, and is now
                            giving further study to the treaty under reference with a view to
                            determining to what extent it would be warranted in waiving its rights
                            under the most-favored-nation provisions of the trade agreement in the
                            light of the recommendation of the Advisory Committee.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States will communicate further in this
                            regard with the Government of Haiti as soon as possible.</p>

                        <p>In reply to the request of the Haitian Government, reported in despatch

                            December 5. Two copies of the Memorandum are enclosed<note n="54"

                            information and the files of the Legation, and for transmission to the
                            Haitian Foreign Office.</p>
                        <p>Your attention is directed to the arguments adduced in the attached
                            Memorandum, which sets forth this Department’s interpretations of the
                            American-Haitian Trade Agreement of 1935 and of the September 18, 1941
                            recommendations of the Inter-American Financial and Economic Advisory
                            Committee.</p>
                        <p>The Department’s attitude on this question, it may be pointed out, is not
                            based upon the interpretation of the Executive Agreement of September
                            13, 1941, to which you referred at page five of despatch no. 535 of
                            November 5. (The Department has observed that your <pb n="366"
                                xml:id="pg_366" facs="0374"/>conversation with the Foreign Minister,
                            reported in that despatch, was confined to an expression of purely
                            personal views.) Specifically, the Department prefers not to advance the
                            theory that “the language employed in Article XX of the Accord of August
                            7, 1933, did not seem to be incorporated in the Executive Agreement of
                            September 13, 1941, for the reason that the two Governments had decided
                            to confer this duty of the Fiscal Representative upon the Board of
                            Directors of the National Bank consisting of three American and three
                            Haitian members”.</p>
                        <p>However, as the Department continues to make further studies of the trade
                            between Haiti and the Dominican Republic, mentioned in the penultimate
                            paragraph of the December 5 Memorandum, it wishes to have the benefit of
                            the views of the National Bank of the Republic of Haiti, particularly
                            regarding the effects which the Convention might be anticipated to have
                            upon Haitian revenues. The Legation’s despatch no. 553, of November 11,
                            stated that the Bank had undertaken, on its own initiative, a study of
                            this aspect of the Commercial Convention.</p>

                        <p>The Governments of the United States of America and the Republic of Haiti
                            announce that agreement has been reached in principle regarding a
                            long-term program of cooperation in the development of Haitian
                            agriculture and economy. The central feature of this program will be a
                            broad plan of rubber developments; an increase in banana plantings; the
                            planting of oil crops, spices, drug plants, food plants, and fiber
                            plants, cacao improvement; the development of Haitian forestry
                            resources; and the stimulation of small handicraft industries. Although
                            details for the carrying out of the project are yet to be worked out, it
                            is contemplated that the development will begin at carefully selected
                            central plantations from which a small grower industry may be stimulated
                            and directed, and technical information and assistance provided. The
                            program is based on numerous surveys and long experience of the United
                            States Department of Agriculture, which has already established in Haiti
                            breeding gardens for rubber plants and an experiment station.</p>

                        <p>This cooperative program will also involve an extension in the amount of
                            up to $500,000 in the existing contract entered into in 1938 by the
                            Export-Import Bank and the J. G. White Engineering Corporation, to
                            permit the completion of certain highway and irrigation projects now in
                            process and to provide adequate transportation facilities to the areas
                            suitable for the rubber and general agricultural development.</p>
                        <p>Discussions which have led to the agreements in principle in the above
                            sense have been conducted between the appropriate agencies of the
                            Government of the United States and His Excellency Elie Lescot, Haitian

                            <p>On October 7, 1940 the Honorable the Under Secretary of State of the
                                United States of America was good enough to deliver to the Mexican

                                1940—in his turn delivered to him, pursuant to instructions from his
                                Government, a memorandum<note n="3" xml:id="d307fn3"><ref

                            <p>The exchange of the said documents gave rise to a series of

                                the United States and the Mexican Ambassador at Washington. At one
                                of them, held on January 4 [<hi rend="italic">24</hi>], 1941, Mr.
                                Sumner Welles was good enough to suggest the desirability of the

                                same conversation, Under Secretary Welles expressed the opinion that
                                the settlement of the petroleum question would be a most important
                                factor—from the viewpoint of American opinion—in assuring the
                                success of the negotiations which are being carried out.</p>
                            <p>The Mexican Government, animated by the best will to reach an
                                understanding which would be just, honorable and definitive
                                regarding the points under controversy, believes that the moment is
                                particularly propitious for presenting to the American Government a
                                general project for the solution of the said problems. The project
                                in question includes not only the bases for settling the petroleum
                                question, the payment of the general and agrarian claims and the use
                                of the international waters, but also the principles of a
                                commercial, banking and financial cooperation capable of favoring
                                the development of Mexican economy in the manner which the evolution
                                of the country renders desirable, and in the proportion required,
                                also, not only by the necessity of carrying out the undertakings
                                implied in the agreements to which the two Republics may arrive, but
                                the intention of responding to the obligations deriving, in the
                                field of continental defense, from the declarations signed at the

                            <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Memorandum</hi></p>
                            <p>I. The expropriation of the petroleum companies affected by the
                                decree of March 18, 1938 was carried out in accordance with the
                                principles of our constitution, in the exercise of our national
                                sovereignty, and in virtue of the fact that the respective
                                enterprises had been defying in a constant and deliberate manner the
                                application of the laws in force in the country and opposing the
                                social progress and the just revindications of the laboring classes
                                and endeavoring to foment every kind of international difficulties;
                                this latter to the <pb n="373" xml:id="pg_373" facs="0381"/>special
                                detriment of the cordiality of relations maintained by Mexico with
                                the nations said by the stockholders of the said companies to be
                                their countries of origin.</p>
                            <p>Absolutely legal from the national viewpoint, the measure adopted by
                                the Mexican Government is in harmony with the principles maintained
                                on the subject by various foreign states and particularly by the
                                American Supreme Court of Justice both as regards the expropriation
                                of the petroleum wealth of the subsoil, as to the instalments for
                                the indemnification, and to the manner of payment therefor.</p>
                            <p>As the intention of the Mexican Government, in accordance with the
                                principles of our country, is to grant an adequate indemnification
                                in the cases of expropriation, there are not mentioned here the
                                writs of execution which might be invoked on the plane of a
                                juridical discussion of the subject; nor do we insist on the points
                                of view which very distinguished writers on law (such as Barthelemy,
                                Deguit, Rolin, Alvarez and Strupp) have maintained in studying—for
                                example—the agrarian reform of Rumania, in the sense that there is
                                no international rule establishing for a given state the obligation
                                of paying a compensation to the nationals of other states when it is
                                a matter of expropriations similar to that which was carried out on
                                the basis of the Decree of March 18, 1938.</p>
                            <p>Mexico repeats on this occasion that it does not cherish the
                                slightest desire of failing to pay the expropriated petroleum
                                companies an acceptable and just compensation; but it does have an
                                interest in emphasizing that in taking such decision it does so with
                                absolute liberty and with full knowledge of the manner in which
                                other states have resolved analogous problems; whereby it sets on
                                record once and for all that it is animated by the purpose of
                                adjusting its conduct to the broadest interpretations of the canons
                                of International Law in harmony with a proven manifestation of
                                international good will.</p>
                            <p>II. Once the expropriation was made, the process of the diplomatic
                                claims could not be adjusted on bases of rapid solution.
                                Nevertheless such bases are evident—Mexico has the necessary means
                                to meet any undertaking of indemnization derived from reasonable and
                                equitable settlements. There is in the first place the petroleum
                                wealth itself; not only that of the expropriated companies but that
                                of the zones exploited originally by the nation. The present yield
                                of petroleum is rising considerably. If the subject should be
                                settled therefore by strictly commercial criteria, it would be
                                practicable to arrive at a conclusion on payment with solid
                                guarantees, since the production of Mexican petroleum would offer
                                such guarantees of undeniable amplitude.</p>
                            <p>The foregoing appears to have been properly judged by the American
                                Department of State for on January 4 [<hi rend="italic">24?</hi>],
                                1941, during a <pb n="374" xml:id="pg_374" facs="0382"/>conversation
                                maintained on the subject by Mr. Sumner Welles with the Mexican
                                Ambassador at Washington, the former of the officials mentioned
                                indicated, as a new course to be followed by the negotiations, the
                                direct and confidential settlement between the Chancelleries of the
                                two countries; a settlement which would have as its basis the
                                possibility of compensating in petroleum for the loss suffered by
                                the American companies on March 18, 1938.</p>
                            <p>With reference to this matter, it is necessary to point out that in
                                the conversation referred to Mr. Welles limited himself to
                                contemplating the possibility of payment in petroleum, without
                                defining what basis would have to be taken for the purpose of fixing
                                the amount of the compensations, so that it must be understood that
                                although the valuation by our courts has not been objected to in
                                principle by the Department of State, it is desired to avoid a
                                process which has been and can be the cause of slow and vexatious
                                controversies respecting the amount owed, with designation of
                                experts and lamentable loss of time for both parties. Precisely in
                                order to avoid such difficulties, the Mexican Government has studied
                                a formula of compensation which in the course of the present
                                document will be set forth with the necessary details and which
                                eliminates any contention respecting the amount of the
                                appraisements.</p>
                            <p>Mexico will have no objection to accepting the course proposed by Mr.
                                Welles—that is to say: the previous conversations between our
                                Embassy at Washington and the Department of State—provided that in
                                case a solution is reached, the latter be published after the
                                settlement, as a result of a direct understanding between the
                                Mexican Government and the petroleum companies. If, because of
                                refusal on the part of the latter, the arrangement concerted between
                                the Mexican Embassy at Washington and the American Department of
                                State should not be capable of crystallization into a practical and
                                immediate formula, it will be understood that the Department of
                                State will desist from any future diplomatic action regarding the
                                said subject, and that the American Government will declare publicly
                                that it withdraws its interest from the question, leaving the
                                companies to face the consequences of their attitude.</p>
                            <p>As regards the manner of compensation in petroleum, the system is
                                deemed in every way acceptable. At the present time our country has
                                a very important petroleum production. Those stocks will be assigned
                                in part to the meeting of the necessities of domestic consumption;
                                but the excess, which is considerable, cannot and should not be
                                lost, for it would mean an appreciable prejudice to the national
                                economy.</p>
                            <p>With reference to this matter—and pending the reaching of an integral
                                solution of the petroleum problem—it is opportune to recall that the
                                Mexican Government has refused to sell the excess referred <pb
                                    n="375" xml:id="pg_375" facs="0383"/>to to those countries which
                                eventually might be enemies of the American continent; but this
                                attitude, founded on the basis of our international doctrine, the
                                practice of which the United States of America will not hesitate to
                                appreciate and acknowledge, implies serious sacrifices which merit
                                the special attention of the American Department of State. The
                                latter point should lead to the consideration of the fact that the
                                United States market is at present unilaterally protected by a duty
                                on the importation of oil, which makes the sending of our products
                                prohibitive in practice. The reduction of fifty percent from the
                                duty referred to on the amounts imported under the quota system
                                diminishes only slightly the prejudice indicated, since the quota
                                fixed for Mexico is very low and the increase granted for 1941
                                (1,000,000 barrels) is not in proportion to what Mexico might have
                                expected from the American authorities, as a demonstration of their
                                desire to treat the general problem of the pending negotiations
                                within the framework of a wide and equitable economic
                                understanding.</p>
                            <p>III. The present moment in international affairs appears to be
                                propitious for the United States of America to examine the
                                importance of aiding Mexico, now that certain reserves have
                                disappeared, in settling a problem which, for many reasons, is
                                disturbing—to the detriment of good inter-American collaboration—to
                                our full economic development. The desire for cooperation which
                                inspires Mexico and the abundance of elements at her disposal for
                                reaching a just agreement, enhance the necessity for both parties to
                                approach the question in a spirit of goodwill that can be translated
                                at once into actual and constructive efforts.</p>
                            <p>The slowness in the proceedings for reaching an acceptable solution
                                harms not only the conflicting interests—Mexico and the oil
                                companies—but raises a material obstacle for the complete
                                understanding of two friendly countries, and deplorably weakens the
                                strength of any future Pan American action.</p>
                            <p>In fact, there are to be taken into account not only friction arising
                                out of the very fact that the conflict goes on without settlement,
                                but also the circumstance that Mexico is consequently rendered
                                incapable of assuming with all the power of her economy the
                                obligations which her continental position marks out for her.</p>
                            <p>The campaign which the affected companies have carried on and are
                                continuing to carry on in the United States, the distrust inspired
                                by the notes and the pending claims, and the lack of full financial
                                collaboration between the two nations mean a sluggishness in the
                                economic evolution of Mexico and an impoverishment which deprive our
                                country of resources essential to meeting certain obligations, among
                                which figure the possible construction of naval and air bases in its
                                territory, and the necessity for providing its armed forces with
                                modern and expensive armament.</p>
                            <pb n="376" xml:id="pg_376" facs="0384"/>
                            <p>The present moment is, from all standpoints, the most favorable for
                                the initiation of a new era in the history of the international
                                relations of Mexico and the United States.</p>
                            <p>In view of the European tragedy and the abuse of power by the
                                totalitarian countries, the Mexican people—faithful to the
                                international policy of equality, fraternity and good neighborhood—,
                                not only perceives with genuine sympathy the continental objectives
                                which will be imposed upon its efforts in the future, but it also
                                feels, in an extraordinarily positive way, the advisability of a
                                joint action in defense of Democracy with the other American
                                republics and in particular with the United States of America.</p>
                            <p>An effective, rapid and just settlement of the matters pending
                                between the two nations would consolidate very happily the power of
                                the Pan American doctrine and would give a character of lasting
                                cordiality to the relations between the two governments. For this,
                                the Government of Mexico is disposed to employ all its modest
                                resources and all its full desire to eliminate occasions for
                                controversy, adjusting itself to a broad spirit of collaboration and
                                concord. In expressing this to the Department of State, it ventures
                                to believe that, on its part, the Government of the United States of
                                America will likewise be inspired by the same sentiments of good
                                neighborhood and just cooperation.</p>
                            <p>IV. On the basis of all the foregoing, the Department of Foreign
                                Relations, being desirous of obtaining within the shortest possible
                                period a practical result from the negotiations which have been
                                pending for years between Mexico and the United States of America,
                                has the honor to submit to the consideration of the Department of
                                State the following bases for an understanding:</p>
                            <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Claims</hi>. The Mexican Government accepts the
                                first point of the plan submitted on October 7, 1940 to Ambassador
                                Castillo Nájera by Mr. Sumner Welles, that is: It accepts as the
                                total amount for the agrarian claims and those arising out of the
                                General Claims Convention the sum of $40,000,000 (Forty Million
                                Dollars), which will be paid in the following way: <list>

                            <p>The Mexican Government authorizes that of the United States to
                                announce—when the agreement referred to has once been concluded—that
                                the total sum mentioned above will be divided into various parts
                                corresponding to the different types of claims (agrarian
                                claims—presented in accordance with the Convention of November
                                1938;—agrarian claims arising between July 31, 1939 and October 7,

                            <p>For accounting purposes, Mexico is in agreement that the United
                                States hold in separate accounts the funds received and those
                                delivered to it subsequently.</p>

                                Mexican-American Defense Commission. The Mexican Commissioners would
                                be the Military, Naval and Air Attachés assigned to the Embassy at

                                question, the Government of Mexico believes that an understanding
                                may be reached with the expropriated American companies, by means of
                                a payment of the compensation requested through the

                                easily understood from what is stated in Note 4983 presented to the

                                of the very nature of the difficulties that have arisen, cannot and

                                obtain such an objective, without reaching which Mexico would feel
                                that her vital interests had been injured,—both those of the present

                                rise to the present memorandum, the Department of Foreign Relations
                                has the honor to communicate to the Department of State
                                that,—reserving the right to examine with due care the clauses of
                                the Treaty which it proposes,—it would be satisfied for the present
                                to be informed that the American Government accepts, in principle,
                                the initiative referred to and is disposed to consider it without
                                limitation to the course of merely one of the rivers or a part of

                            <p>In proposing a general Treaty, Mexico takes technical and legal
                                reasons into account. From the latter point of view, the partial
                                solutions—proposed <pb n="380" xml:id="pg_380" facs="0388"/>on
                                former occasions—do not satisfy the principle of International Law

                                must not cause harm to its neighbor, a thing which has occurred, in
                                the case of Mexico, as a result of the use which the United States
                                of America has been making, thanks to the utilizations made.</p>
                            <p>Furthermore, from the technical point of view, an equitable
                                distribution of the waters may be effected only by means of studies
                                and projects carried out jointly by the two countries.</p>

                                of the general claims and those of agrarian origin, would
                                unilaterally affect the economic conditions of its development if
                                the United States did not contribute on its side all the necessary

                                improving commercial intercourse between the two republics and of
                                giving to Mexico the opportunity to increase its exports to the
                                extent made necessary, not only by the fact of contracting the
                                obligations of which it is a question, but also by the desire to
                                assume very energetically the responsibilities accruing from the
                                agreements in matters of continental defense.</p>

                                exportation of oil to the United States of America, since the limit
                                set for 1941 is excessively reduced, and places our country in a
                                situation which does not correspond with the proposal—loyally
                                respected by our Government—not to deal in the said product, nor in
                                others such as scrap iron, etc., by taking advantage of the
                                opportunities offered it by certain countries, which,—in view of the
                                present international situation—might in the future be prejudicial
                                to the interests of the American continent.</p>

                                takes the liberty of insisting upon the necessity of obtaining from

                                importation of oil.</p>
                            <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Sale of Silver</hi>. In view of the financial
                                obligations of a permanent character which, as has been said in
                                other paragraphs of this memorandum, the Mexican Government is about
                                to contract, the country will have to guarantee the continuity of
                                its mineral production, which is so important to its general
                                economy. For such purpose, <pb n="381" xml:id="pg_381" facs="0389"
                                />Mexico will need to have the assurance, at least for a period of
                                four years, of the purchase of silver by the American Treasury at a
                                reasonable price. To this end, the Department of Foreign Relations
                                expresses the sincere hope that the American Government, by virtue
                                of the authorization which present laws of the United States give to
                                the Treasury Department, will be disposed to contract for the
                                purchase of a quantity of Mexican silver equivalent to the total
                                amount which our country could deliver within a period of four
                                years, through monthly shipments of six and one-half million ounces,
                                of recent production, with the understanding that the delivery of
                                the silver would be made by our Government in equal monthly
                                quantities during the next four years, at a price analogous to that
                                which is now being paid to American producers. The sales contract
                                should be signed for the abovementioned total and payments would be
                                made monthly in conformity with the proposed periodical
                                shipments.</p>
                            <p>The suggested equalization is based upon the fact that, as a
                                consequence of the European War, Mexico has lost her markets for
                                some of her industrial metals, which at present are being sold in
                                the United States after payment of heavy import duties. The
                                cancellation or reduction of these would be difficult to arrange
                                because it would doubtless give rise to many protests, but there
                                might be found a just compensation—which would not raise the same
                                obstacles—by increasing the purchase value of the silver, which
                                would equalize the position of Mexican producers of this metal, who
                                are likewise producers of the industrial metals referred to.</p>
                            <p>It may be added that, in the event of the arrival at the agreement
                                relative to the sale of Mexican silver on the conditions indicated
                                in the preceding paragraphs, Mexico would be willing that the
                                difference between the value of forty-five cents per ounce and the
                                price fixed for the product should be applied to the construction
                                and conditioning of naval bases, air-fields and, in general, to
                                material works intended to perfect the defensive system of the
                                territory.</p>
                            <p>9. <hi rend="italic">Stabilization Credit</hi>. The collaboration of
                                the United States could manifest itself, likewise, through an
                                agreement signed by the American institution which may be considered
                                best suited and the Bank of Mexico, whereby a credit would be opened
                                in favor of the latter up to an amount of $30,000,000.00 (thirty
                                million dollars) in a current account, with the right, on the part
                                of the said Bank of Mexico, to make dollar deposits in that account,
                                a reciprocal interest of 1½ percent on the balances being
                                established.</p>
                            <p>The availability of the fund thus constituted would serve for
                                monetary and exchange regularization, with the understanding that it
                                would in no way mean a declaration, on the part of Mexico, that it
                                would maintain a fixed rate of exchange, since a relative stability
                                    <pb n="382" xml:id="pg_382" facs="0390"/>would be sought, our
                                country being authorized to modify the rate of exchange in the
                                manner it might consider to be most advantageous, when the economic
                                conditions of its balance of payments may so require.</p>
                            <p>In the event that the proposed agreement is arrived at, it would be
                                completed by means of a stipulation to the effect that if—after
                                being in force for five years—the agreement is not extended, by
                                mutual agreement, the liquidation of the balances would be proceeded
                                to and it would be agreed that the balances against Mexico would be
                                paid in twenty-year 3 percent bonds, with yearly amortizations, our
                                country reserving to itself the option of paying in silver.</p>
                            <p>This agreement would contain, in addition, a clause whereby the
                                dollars—in any balance—shall be computed at the rate of $35.00
                                (thirty-five dollars) per ounce of gold.</p>
                            <p>10. <hi rend="italic">Construction of Highways</hi>. It is the
                                intention of the Mexican Government, among its other aims, to give
                                special attention to the construction of new highways and to the
                                improvement of those which already exist. For the purpose indicated,
                                it is proposed to effect an issue of road bonds which it hopes to
                                place entirely within the country. However, if the latter should not
                                be possible, it would wish to count on the prospect of a credit up
                                to $60,000,000.00 (sixty million dollars), opened in some American
                                institution—whichever one may be chosen by the Government of the
                                United States;—it being understood that such amount would be
                                equivalent to 60 percent of the total issue and that the bonds
                                intended to cover the credit referred to would have the benefit of
                                interest at 3 percent and would be liquidated within a period of
                                from ten to fifteen years, by means of semiannual amortizations with
                                payment of principal and interest, in such manner that the value of
                                the bond would decrease as the date of its maturity approached.</p>
                            <p>11. <hi rend="italic">Treaty of Commerce</hi>. In his memorandum of
                                October 7, 1940, the Under Secretary of State of the United States
                                was good enough to state (Paragraph 11, Section <hi rend="italic"
                                    >c</hi>) that, at the time of announcing agreement on the
                                settlements relative to the oil question “the Governments of Mexico
                                and of the United States would begin conversations looking toward
                                the increase of trade exchanges, by means of a Treaty”. The
                                Department of Foreign Relations is giving to the suggestion of the
                                Department of State all the attention that it merits and takes
                                pleasure in communicating to it that it agrees to initiate, as soon
                                as possible, the preparatory work for the conclusion of a Treaty of
                                Commerce, which, on equitable bases, would make it possible to give
                                the greatest possible increment to the interchange between the two
                                countries.</p>
                            <pb n="383" xml:id="pg_383" facs="0391"/>
                            <p>V. Taking into account the circumstance that the plan for a general
                                settlement, defined in the foregoing pages, presupposes the adoption
                                of various resolutive measures concerning technical problems of the
                                greatest importance, the Government of Mexico states that, in case
                                its proposals are accepted, in principle, it is most willing to
                                assign to its Embassy in Washington, in the character of Minister
                                Counselors or of Technical Advisers, those legal, financial or other
                                experts which it may be necessary to commission for the rapid
                                progress of the negotiation, in the understanding that it is its
                                desire that the latter be effected through the customary diplomatic
                                channels and not within the framework of a special conference.</p>
                            <p>Finally,—the several points which are examined in this memorandum
                                being closely related to each other,—the Government of Mexico states
                                that the solution to which it aspires ought, in so far as possible,
                                to be a general one.</p>

                            say that the Department feels that satisfactory and rapid progress is
                            being made in the preparations for the early successful termination of
                            the general negotiations. As to the specific problems, you may make the
                            following observations:</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Claims</hi>. Since the two Governments appear to be
                            substantially in agreement, the differences between our original
                            proposals and the Mexican counterproposals of February 17 should be
                            readily adjusted.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Defense</hi>. This Government has been favorably
                            impressed by the progress made in joint discussions and by the adoption
                            of the Convention relating to military aircraft.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Oil</hi>. Very confidentially and informally this
                            Department has been exploring through oil experts of the Interior
                            Department who are in touch with a representative of Petróleos Mexicanos
                            the possibilities of arriving at a formula for the solution of the oil
                            controversy. Progress in the studies is being made about as rapidly as
                            could be expected and it is hoped they may lead to a satisfactory
                            formula. The oil question appears to be the most difficult of those
                            under consideration.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Foreign Debt</hi>. While this Government has not been a
                            party to negotiations involving past agreements, the Department has been
                            interested to learn of resumption of discussions between Señor Suárez
                            and Mr. Lamont, and it is hoped that they will work out a mutually <pb
                                n="384" xml:id="pg_384" facs="0392"/>satisfactory solution of this
                            problem. If the Department can assist in this matter it will be glad to
                            exercise its unofficial good offices.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">International Waters</hi>. This difficult question has
                            been given much careful thought. The following statement is strictly
                            confidential but you may convey it to President of Mexico for his own
                            information: We have been endeavoring in confidential conversations with
                            certain United States interests to find a solution and expect to have a
                            response from these interests soon.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Economic Cooperation</hi>. Arrangements have already
                            been made for Treasury Department experts to begin discussions possibly
                            in the near future with Mexican representatives concerning mutual
                            monetary problems with specific reference to stabilization and
                            silver.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Quota for Importation of Mexican Oil</hi>. It will be
                            difficult to approach this problem before the two countries enter upon
                            negotiations for a reciprocal trade agreement.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Highway Construction</hi>. We expect to be prepared
                            soon to discuss the matter of cooperating in financing of Mexican
                            highway construction.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Trade Agreement</hi>. Our present feeling is that
                            public notification of intention to negotiate should be deferred until a
                            formal solution of the oil expropriations matter has been found. Our
                            preliminary studies have virtually been completed. It is suggested
                            Mexico likewise prepare for later discussions on this subject.</p>

                        <p>With reference to the conversation which the Mexican Ambassador had with
                            Messrs. Duggan and Bursley of the Department of State on July 14,
                                1941,<note n="13" xml:id="d309fn13">Memorandum of conversation not

                            solution of the problem which calls for the payment of compensation to
                            the American petroleum companies expropriated (<hi rend="italic"
                                >sic</hi>) in conformity with the Decree of March 18, 1938, there is
                            furnished below, following careful study by the Mexican Government of
                            the plan proposed by the representatives of the Department of State,
                            explanation of the point of view of the Government of Mexico.</p>
                        <p>I. The setting up of a Mexican-American commission is not considered
                            opportune and the Mexican Government states immediately <pb n="385"
                                xml:id="pg_385" facs="0393"/>that it cannot accept the designation
                            of a third person who would serve as umpire of the expert officials
                            since the American experts, who have been studying the matter, know it
                            perfectly and their report should represent for the Government of the
                            United States the expression of an impartial opinion which would be just
                            and technically satisfactory.</p>
                        <p>In this regard it may be recalled that the designation of an arbiter was
                            not included in the initial proposal formulated by Under Secretary
                            Welles in his memorandum of October 7, 1940 (Vl-<hi rend="italic"
                                >a</hi>.)<note n="14" xml:id="d309fn14"><ref

                                    1048</ref>.</note> The proposals contained in the said
                            memorandum of the Government of the United States by implication
                            discarded the arbitral system, a circumstance which precisely made
                            possible the initiation (of discussions) for the direct settlement
                            between the Government of Mexico and the United States.</p>
                        <p>II. It is not possible to accept the idea of constituting a commission
                            such as that which Mr. Duggan suggested in the conversation held with
                            the Ambassador of Mexico on July 5, 1941,<note n="15" xml:id="d309fn15"
                                >Memorandum of conversation not printed.</note> because the
                            proceedings would involve great slowness in the transaction of this
                            matter and a purely unfortunate situation in Mexican public opinion
                            which, for months, has been awaiting an equitable solution which the
                            Mexican Government is desirable to agree to and to facilitate.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States may rest assured that the Government
                            of Mexico understands its desire to be absolutely guaranteed, not only
                            with regard to the expropriated companies but before the public opinion
                            of its country, but it is of the opinion that the authority of the
                            official experts who participated in the conversations with Engineer
                                Zevada<note n="16" xml:id="d309fn16">Manuel J. Zevada had held
                                conversations with officials of the Department of the
                                Interior.</note> is incontestable and that, on the other hand, the
                            proposed trip of the said experts to Mexico in the near future with the
                            object of verifying the data upon which their report is based, will be
                            sufficient to give to American public opinion the assurances that their
                            report is based strictly upon the facts (<hi rend="italic"
                            >realidad</hi>). In this regard, the Government of Mexico proposes to
                            that of the United States that it will authorize for the American
                            technicians all the facilities in the Republic of Mexico in order that
                            they may check the books and examine the expropriated properties.</p>
                        <p>The Government of Mexico considers it indispensable that the experts of
                            the two Governments terminate their work, already begun in Washington,
                            within the briefest period and suggests that they be given a period of
                            two months.</p>
                        <pb n="386" xml:id="pg_386" facs="0394"/>
                        <p>The experts will submit a joint report in which they will set forth their
                            points of difference in case there are any.</p>
                        <p>III. In this event, the Governments of Mexico and the United States,
                            within the month following the receipt of the report of the experts,
                            will discuss the points of difference and will agree upon the final
                            figure of indemnity through diplomatic negotiations.</p>
                        <p>IV. The Government of Mexico agrees to make a deposit of $9,000,000 on
                            account of the total of the indemnity with the understanding,
                            nevertheless, that the making of this deposit will take place only when
                            the Government of Mexico knows exactly the economic and financial
                            advantages upon which it may count in order to face not only this new
                            commitment (<hi rend="italic">compromiso</hi>) but also those which will
                            arise from the arrangement regarding claims. These advantages can be
                            understood upon the conclusion of the negotiations now in progress with
                            the Department of State, that of Treasury and the Export-Import Bank of
                            the United States.</p>
                        <p>V. For the period in which this deposit is not applied to the
                            compensation agreed upon, the sum of $9,000,000 will draw interest at
                            the rate of . . percent annually. In case the diplomatic negotiations
                            referred to in point III above do not succeed in determining the
                            definitive indemnity, the deposit of $9,000,000 will be returned to the
                            Government of Mexico.</p>
                        <p>VI. The exchange of notes by which this arrangement is made and the
                            treaties regarding the payment of claims, the money stabilization and
                            other arrangements, shall be signed simultaneously.</p>
                        <p>VII. If any balance remains for the total payment of the indemnity which
                            is definitively determined in accordance with the foregoing points, it
                            will be paid by the Government of Mexico by means of percentages of
                            petroleum production which shall be delivered during a period to be
                            determined by the experts referred to in point II above, the Government
                            of Mexico reserving the right to increase the annual deliveries in such
                            form that the liquidation of the debt will be made in a briefer period
                            if, in its opinion, circumstances so permit.</p>
                        <p>VIII. The Government of the United States agrees to increase the quota
                            actually permitted by the importation of Mexican petroleum and its
                            derivatives into the United States enjoying the exemption of 50% of
                            import tax to a minimum of 25,000,000 barrels annually beginning with
                            December 1, 1941.</p>

                                the indemnity that the Mexican Government shall pay to the American
                                oil companies which have not yet made separate settlements with the
                                Government of Mexico. The experts may employ such assistants as they

                            <p>The Government of Mexico will establish in the Treasury of the United

                                partial payment of the indemnity according to the total which shall
                                be definitively fixed for this purpose as a result of the work of
                                the experts and the agreement of the Governments of Mexico and the
                                United States.</p>

                                find differences in their estimates, the Governments of Mexico and
                                the United States agree to resolve these differences by diplomatic
                                negotiations.</p>

                            Secretary had informed Mr. Bursley that the Department was not in a

                            purchased farm lands in Mexico.</p>
                        <p>It was explained to Dr. Córdova that the Department had gone to great
                            lengths in recent days to meet the Mexican Embassy with regard to five
                            or more points it had raised but that it was not practicable to give the

                            to comply with a somewhat similar request of this Government that there

                            conversations in which they had participated (and these included those
                            conducted by Mr. Duggan) the position taken by the Department’s
                            representatives had been that the Department could certainly not agree
                            to include such assurances in the Convention, that the Department would
                            give consideration to the possibility of an exchange of notes but could
                            not promise that even this would be feasible, but that in any event,
                            even were there to be an exchange of notes, there would have to be
                            provision for bona fide cases of inheritance, court judgments, et
                            cetera.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Córdova went through all the motions of being greatly upset over this
                            situation although neither Mr. English nor Mr. Bursley had the slightest
                            thought that this development was at all surprising to Dr. Córdova. Dr.
                            Córdova said that it was his understanding that agreement upon our part
                            to this Mexican desire was a <hi rend="italic">sine qua non</hi> and
                            said that he would have to consult with the Ambassador. He left the
                            meeting for this purpose and said that he would consult with us
                            further.</p>
                        <p>It is only within the past few days that the Mexican negotiators have
                            laid this much stress upon the question of the desired assurances. While
                            they are undoubtedly desired for reasons of Mexican domestic politics,
                            including the question of the relationship between the present President
                            of Mexico and his predecessor, there is reason to question that the
                            Mexicans will insist upon this to the last. There is every indication
                            that the Mexican Government badly needs the signing of the contemplated
                            agreements with the United States. Moreover, the financial arrangements
                            contemplated must appear very attractive to the Mexican Government. It
                            might risk a collapse of the negotiations but this is to be doubted.</p>
                        <p>Possibly, as a compromise measure, it might be worthwhile considering
                            whether the Department would accept the filing by the Mexican Ambassador
                            of a confidential memorandum stating that it understood that the
                            Secretary or the Under Secretary would not regard it as an unfriendly
                            act for Mexico to prohibit the acquisition of agricultural lands in
                            Mexico by foreigners. (Without commitment, a suggestion along these
                            lines was made to Dr. Córdova, every effort being made to bring out that
                            this was primarily a Mexican domestic matter and was one which could be
                            handled by Mexico without intervention by this Government.)</p>

                            chapter relative to the negotiations proposed on the claims question, it
                            was said: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) The arrangement shall contain a clause
                                    in which the United States Government will agree to refrain from
                                    resorting to diplomatic action in those cases in which the
                                    agrarian legislation is applied, in the future, to lands
                                    belonging to Americans who have acquired said lands subsequent
                                    to the date of the agreement in negotiation.</p>
                                <p>“With respect to this last paragraph the explanation should be
                                    made that the Government of Mexico has serious reasons to fear
                                    that, in a more or less near future, lands which now belong to
                                    Mexican owners or to foreigners of nationality other than
                                    American, may pass, by real or fictitious sales, into the
                                    possession of United States nationals, in an attempt thus to
                                    seek the protection of the Washington Government and bring up a
                                    problem similar to the one which we are now trying to settle. In
                                    order to avoid the difficulty pointed out, which would involve
                                    further friction between the two Governments, the Government of
                                    Mexico considers it desirable that, after this arrangement has
                                    been concluded, the lands which at the present time do not
                                    belong to American nationals, if they are subsequently the
                                    object of expropriations, shall be subject to the general law
                                    and, therefore, that diplomatic action shall not be proper in
                                    those cases in which, through real or fictitious transfer, such
                                    lands appear as owned by Americans.”</p>

                            Political Adviser of the Department, and Mr. Bursley, Chief of the
                            Mexican section. At this meeting, according to the notes which are
                            retained by the Ambassador and Legal Counselor Córdova, Mr. Bursley
                            expressed his belief, which he qualified as being personal and entirely
                            unofficial, that the points raised in the Embassy’s observations would
                            not involve difficulties of a serious character as, of course, he
                            thought that some of them would win complete approval. It was agreed at
                            this meeting that the above-mentioned Mr. Bursley would confer with Lic.
                            Córdova in the first part of the following week. The Department of State
                            made the translation into English of the observation which has just been

                            that Memorandum it was said textually: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                    based on the application of Mexico’s agrarian laws which might

                            possibility of an exchange of notes simultaneous with the signing of the
                            Claims Convention; they expressed the necessity that, in any case, those
                            notes should not be made public, and they also expressed their desire
                            that the Mexican Government should agree to exceptions to such waiver,
                            for the cases of Americans acquiring real property subsequent to the
                            signature of the Convention through a title other than that of purchase,
                            as, for example, by inheritance, judicial adjudication, etc. Counselor
                            Córdova at once stated that he considered it possible to make the
                            above-mentioned exceptions, whenever it was a question of acquisitions
                            more or less involuntary on the part of Americans, and in good faith.
                            Messrs. English and Bursley told Counselor Córdova that the question of
                            the waiver of diplomatic protection, requested by Mexico, was
                            undoubtedly one of the difficulties which the Department had under
                            study, but that the Government of Mexico could depend upon the complete
                            good will of the officials of the State Department to accede to its
                            desires.</p>
                        <p>5. On September 15th a conference took place attended by the Ambassador
                            of Mexico, the Legal Counselor of the Embassy, Mr. Duggan, Political
                            Adviser, Mr. Bursley, Assistant Chief of the Division of American
                            Republics, and Mr. English, the three last mentioned being from the
                            Department of State.<note n="23" xml:id="d311fn1">Memorandum of
                                conversation not printed.</note> The Ambassador advised the American
                            officials that on Saturday, the 13th, in the afternoon, the Embassy had
                            received new instructions from the Department of Foreign Relations of
                            Mexico with reference to the Draft Claims Convention, and that the
                            purpose of the interview was to propose some amendments <pb n="392"
                                xml:id="pg_392" facs="0400"/>to the said Draft. Counselor Córdova
                            read the proposed modifications and additions and then each one of them
                            was considered separately. On the question of the waiver of diplomatic
                            protection, it was made known to the representatives of the Department
                            of State that the Government of Mexico appreciates the reasons of the
                            American Government for not including in the Convention the seventh
                            article of the Mexican Counter-Draft and is therefore in accord with
                            making it the subject of an undertaking by means of an exchange of notes
                            simultaneous with the signature of the Convention. The draft notes were
                            then read which the Government of Mexico proposed on this subject, and
                            copies of the said drafts were left in the hands of the Department of
                            State representatives. Mr. Bursley pointed out that, in the last part of
                            the draft note from the Department of State to the Embassy, as proposed
                            by the Government of Mexico, it only spoke of “inheritance based on
                            blood relationship”, without taking into account conjugal inheritance.
                            The Ambassador of Mexico agreed to the addition of this case, and it was
                            understood that, after the texts had been approved by Mr. Hull, the
                            final decision on the proposed texts would be made known to the
                            representatives of the Embassy.</p>
                        <p>6. On September 16, 1941 Mr. Bursley requested an interview with Legal
                            Counselor Córdova<note n="24" xml:id="d311fn24">Memorandum of
                                conversation not printed.</note> at which the representative of the
                            State Department set forth, with complete exactitude, the respective
                            positions of his Department and of the Embassy on the negotiation of the
                            Claims Treaty, which explanation limited to four the questions then
                            pending for satisfactory solution:-(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) the amount
                            of the annual instalments; (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) the payment of the
                            interest on unpaid instalments; (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) the survival
                            of five patrimonial claims originating prior to October 5, 1940 and
                            officially presented to the two Governments after that date; and
                            finally, (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) (the extinction of the personal
                            claims arising after March 1, 1924, and prior to January 1, 1927).</p>
                        <p>Since September 15, 1941 the Department of State had not again made any
                            reference to the question of the exchange of notes in which the waiver
                            of diplomatic protection was to be made, and on the contrary, the entire
                            negotiation was confined to the possibility of Mexico’s waiving its
                            pretension to exclude the Banco San Lorenzo claim from the extinctive
                            effects of the proposed Convention. Only after a satisfactory solution
                            had been found, in principle, for the San Lorenzo question has the
                            problem of the exchange of notes, which since September 15 seemed to
                            have been settled, likewise in principle, again arisen in an unexpected
                            form. This reopening of the question is all the more unexpected because
                            now the Embassy is advised of the inability of the Department of State
                            to agree to waive diplomatic protection for the cases of Americans
                            acquiring real property in Mexico <pb n="393" xml:id="pg_393"
                                facs="0401"/>subsequent to the signature of the Convention, which
                            inability had never even been mentioned by the representatives of the
                            Department of State.</p>

                        <p rend="center">I</p>
                        <p>An informal study made recently by United States Treasury and Mexican
                            officials showed how very unfavorable is Mexico’s balance of payments.
                            The heavy loss of gold and dollars by the Bank of Mexico in recent
                            months proves that conclusion. The underlying causes of this situation
                            are, of course, a decrease in Mexican exports because of the war, and an
                            increase in the value of Mexico’s imports from the United States.</p>
                        <p rend="center">II</p>
                        <p>As Mexico has undertaken to pay to the United States certain obligations,
                            and as additional foreign obligations will have to be met sooner or
                            later, it is reasonable to expect that Mexico’s balance of payments will
                            tend to become more and more unfavorable as time goes on, unless
                            something is done quickly to strengthen the Mexican economy.</p>
                        <p rend="center">III</p>
                        <p>In order to meet this very serious menace, without disrupting
                            Mexican-American trade through monetary devaluation, tariff walls or
                            other arbitrary methods, there can be but one logical policy for Mexico:
                            to increase production of goods, both for the domestic and the United
                            States markets. Aware of this fact, the Mexican Government has approved
                            and is now carrying out an economic plan. This plan includes, among
                            other things: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>To increase the production of tropical and sub-tropical
                                    products, such as oil seeds and bananas, both for the local and
                                    the United States markets;</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>To stimulate the production of manufactured goods, such as
                                    cellulose and rayon, which were previously imported into Mexico
                                    from countries outside the Hemisphere, and which cannot be
                                    supplied by the United States;</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>To stimulate the production of semi-manufactured goods such as
                                    steel sheets and plates, of which there is a scarcity even in
                                    the United States and which are vital to Mexican
                                    industry;</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>To develop one or several bodies of high-grade iron ores in
                                    order to ship such ores to the United States where they are
                                    sorely needed;</item>
                                <label>5.</label>
                                <item>To establish plants for the production of heavy chemicals and
                                    fertilizers;</item>
                                <pb n="394" xml:id="pg_394" facs="0402"/>

                                <item>To increase the capacity of electrical power plants. There is
                                    a chronic deficiency of power which has held back Mexico’s
                                    economic development during the last ten years;</item>
                                <label>7.</label>
                                <item>To build one or more dry-docks to repair and build Mexican
                                    shipping. At present Mexico does not have such facilities nor
                                    can she avail herself of American dry-docks, because of the
                                    present emergency;</item>
                                <label>8.</label>
                                <item>To increase the efficiency of the Mexican railroad system,
                                    through the acquisition of new material and equipment, so that
                                    said system can take care of the increased volume of freight
                                    resulting from new trade with the United States and within
                                    Mexico;</item>

                                <item>To finish, in the shortest possible time, the dams and
                                    irrigation projects which were started by previous

                                <label>10.</label>
                                <item>To complete Mexico’s road system with a view both to finish
                                    the Mexican section of the Pan American highway and to open up
                                    the West Coast to automobile traffic.</item>

                        <p rend="center">IV</p>
                        <p>The advantages of this plan, both to Mexico and the United States cannot
                            be over-estimated. Through its realization, not only would Mexico’s
                            foreign-trade balance become favorable, but also the standard of living
                            of the Mexican people would be raised considerably. For the United
                            States this program would mean, in the short run, an increasing volume
                            of the so-called critical materials from Mexico, and, in the long run,
                            the greater capacity of Mexicans to consume American manufactures.</p>
                        <p rend="center">V</p>
                        <p>However, Mexico cannot even hope to accomplish the realization of this
                            program without the full cooperation of the United States. Much of the
                            machinery and equipment that Mexico will buy need not be entirely new,
                            for even during the present emergency usable second-hand plants are
                            still available. But Mexico will also need the cooperation of the
                            American Government in order to be able to purchase some new equipment.
                            On the other hand, a fair portion of the capital necessary to carry out
                            this economic program can and will be readily furnished by Mexicans and
                            the Mexican Government, but still another portion has to be borrowed by
                            Mexico from the United States.</p>
                        <p rend="center">VI</p>
                        <p>Should the U. S. Government find it possible to cooperate with the

                            in Washington. President Avila Camacho stated “this is a great event in
                            the friendship between Mexico and the United States of America and not
                            only for them but also for all the countries of the Americas. It
                            confirms the Good Neighbor policy”. Padilla in a longer statement said
                            in effect that the conclusion of the agreements marks a new milestone in
                            the history of Mexican-American relations; that it shows that Mexico

                        <p>On the occasion of the conclusion between Mexico and the United States of
                            America of the various agreements signed in the city of Washington on
                            the 19th instant, I wish to state to Your Excellency my sincere
                            appreciation of the spirit of loyal cooperation which constantly
                            directed the diplomatic negotiations which were indispensable to
                            achieve, by common agreement, a settlement of problems which, although
                            they never endangered the bonds of firm friendship which unite our
                            nations, did nevertheless long occupy the attention of our
                            chancelleries. I have an intimate conviction that the agreements signed
                            will be of real benefit to the two countries and I am sure that they
                            will mark a point of departure, within the work of continental
                            solidarity which our Governments are pursuing, for a fuller
                            understanding between Mexico and the United States. I am also convinced
                            that the conclusions which we have reached will necessarily give a new
                            opportunity to the American countries accurately to estimate the
                            advantages of friendly action, of mutual understanding and respect, as
                            established by the good neighbor doctrine which Your Excellency has
                            defined in terms which are an exhortation to the world for nations to
                            live together in peace and are a solid guarantee for the future of
                            democracy in America.</p>

                        <p>Reference is made to the memorandum of the Ambassador of Mexico of
                            October 7, 1941 regarding a cooperative program embracing the immediate
                            expansion of production in Mexico of certain strategic and critical
                            materials and products needed in the defense program of the United
                            States and a longer run development of the natural resources and
                            industry of Mexico. The memorandum suggests that such cooperation could
                            be furthered by the appointment by the Government of the United States
                            of a liaison officer to work closely with the Mexican authorities in
                            planning and carrying out the program.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States has given careful consideration to
                            this matter and believes that the cooperation suggested offers a most
                            promising opportunity for important and constructive action of benefit
                            to both the United States and Mexico. It is prepared, accordingly, to
                            make available every facility at its disposal for the careful
                            examination of the various individual projects which would be included
                            in a broad program of the sort described in the Ambassador’s memorandum.
                            It proposes, therefore, to appoint a well-qualified and experienced
                            representative, to be assisted where necessary <pb n="400"
                                xml:id="pg_400" facs="0408"/>and desirable by appropriate technical
                            experts, to proceed to Mexico to carry out this work in cooperation with
                            the Mexican authorities.</p>
                        <p>It is suggested that the most efficient results might be obtained by the
                            appointment by the Government of Mexico of a representative to work
                            directly with the representative of the Government of the United States
                            and to furnish direct liaison with the appropriate Mexican agencies.</p>

                            with the Mexican Ambassador adopting a plan substantially identical with
                            that in question. There are enclosed for convenient reference copies of

                        <p>It was a source of very deep regret to the Department that your company

                            agreement just signed. For the reasons with which you are familiar, the
                            Department believes that the agreement is a constructive step forward
                            toward the final solution of the petroleum dispute.</p>

                        <p>As you have been informed, the Department will have a very definite
                            interest in the evaluation proceedings as provided in the agreement and
                            it is desirous that the American expert have at his command all
                            pertinent data. The agreement contains provision for the submission by
                            the various American interests to the experts to be appointed of all
                            data deemed by them to be proper for those experts to take into
                            consideration in determining the value of the respective claims. The
                            Department hopes that your company will take full advantage of this
                            opportunity to file with the American expert the necessary information
                            and such arguments as it may think proper in order that he may
                            intelligently perform his functions in support of your interests in
                            evaluation proceedings.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, I assure you of the Department’s desire to be of whatever
                            assistance it properly can in obtaining adequate compensation for the
                            affected American interests.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: I have for acknowledgment
                            your letter of December 6 and the enclosures therewith relating to the
                            Department’s plan for the appraisal and payment of compensation for the
                            properties, rights and interests of American nationals in the Mexican
                            petroleum industry affected by the Mexican decree of expropriation dated
                            March 18, 1938, and by other acts of the Mexican Government. We have
                            learned more recently through press reports of your further action in
                            this matter, namely, the appointment of Mr. Morris Llewellyn Cooke as
                            the United States expert designated in accordance with the agreement
                            signed by you and the Mexican Ambassador on November 19.</p>
                        <p>In compliance with your request, this company will cooperate with the
                            Department of State and with the American expert in the submission of
                            data and appropriate arguments to assist Mr. Cooke in the performance of
                            his duties.</p>
                        <p>Since the principles involved in the Mexican problem vitally affect the
                            security of all investments abroad, we are hopeful that you will
                            instruct the American expert to adhere to the established principles of
                            international law so clearly set forth by your Department as applicable
                            to this controversy.</p>

                            between the Governments of the United States and Mexico whereby each of
                            those Governments has appointed an expert whose duty it shall be to
                            determine the just compensation to be paid the nationals of the United

                            industry in the United Mexican States were affected to their detriment
                            by acts of the Government of Mexico subsequent to March 17, 1938.</p>
                        <p>I am sincerely appreciative of the cooperative position taken by the

                            President of the United States, has been fully informed by the

                            from the Mexican Government to the affected nationals of the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Cooke is leaving tonight for Mexico City for exploratory
                            conversations with the Mexican expert. He has informed the Department
                            that he does not contemplate holding any formal hearings while in Mexico
                            but that upon his return to the United States towards the end of January
                            he would welcome full conversations with you and the presentation by you
                            of any data or representations you may care to submit. If, under these
                            circumstances, however, you desire to have any of your representatives
                            call upon Mr. Cooke for informal discussions, he will be glad to receive
                            them, in Mexico.</p>

                            Ambassador of Mexico, dated October 7, 1941, regarding a cooperative
                            program embracing the expansion of the natural resources and industry of
                            Mexico, and to the Memorandum of this Government, dated November 26,
                            1941, which stated the opinion that such <pb n="403" xml:id="pg_403"
                                facs="0411"/>collaboration would be of essential and strategic
                            benefit to both the United States and Mexico. It was also stated that
                            this Government was accordingly prepared to make available every
                            facility for the examination of the individual projects composing the
                            broad program outlined in the Ambassador’s Memorandum, and to this end
                            would designate a well qualified and experienced representative, to be
                            assisted, where necessary and desirable, by appropriate technical
                            experts, who would proceed to Mexico to carry out this work in
                            cooperation with the Mexican authorities.</p>
                        <p>Careful consideration is being given to the selection of the
                            representative referred to, and it is expected that the designation will
                            be made in the near future. Meanwhile, Dr. Alan M. Bateman has been
                            designated by this Government as the technical expert to assist in
                            matters pertaining to the production of minerals. The brief biography
                                attached<note n="35" xml:id="d324fn35">Not attached to file
                                copy.</note> clearly indicates, it is believed, Dr. Bateman’s high
                            qualifications for this important work.</p>
                        <p>It is expected that Dr. Bateman will proceed to Mexico within the next
                            two or three weeks, and it is hoped that by the time he reaches Mexico
                            the Mexican Government will have designated the minerals expert with
                            whom he will cooperate.</p>

                            missions in the American republics regarding the establishment by the
                            American republics of a system of export control over materials imported
                            from the United States by the other American republics and subject to
                            export control by the United States, and strategic materials and
                            materials important in our national defense program and for the general
                            defense of all the American republics which are produced in the other
                            American republics. In this connection an especially difficult situation
                            has arisen with regard to the supply of zinc. There is a shortage of
                            zinc in connection with our national defense program, <pb n="404"
                                xml:id="pg_404" facs="0412"/>and commercial contractors as well as
                            the Government of the United States are anxious that all possible
                            supplies of zinc be made available to the United States.</p>
                        <p>The American Smelting and Refining Company has informed us that it has
                            contracts entered into last July for the delivery of some 3,000 tons of
                            zinc to Japan. With production in progress at the Rosita plant it
                            proposes to furnish this metal to Japan during the next 3 months,
                            shipping to the United States the rest of its production over and above
                            Mexican requirements.</p>
                        <p>It would be extremely helpful to the United States if the Mexican
                            Government felt it possible to take some action in these circumstances,
                            prior to the full consideration and working out of the system of export
                            control proposed in the Department’s circular instruction.</p>
                        <p>Please discuss this situation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and
                            report to the Department.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the
                            Department’s confidential telegram No. 101 of March 13, 7 p.m., 1941,
                            requesting that I discuss with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the
                            United Mexican States the question of an export control by the Mexican
                            Government. I also have the honor to refer to my despatch No. 12398 of
                            March 17, 1941,<note n="37" xml:id="d326fn37">Not printed.</note> in
                            answer to the Department’s forementioned Telegraphic Instruction No.
                            101. At the request of the Under-Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Lic.
                            Jaime Torres Bodet, I, accompanied by the Commercial Attaché,<note

                            Under-Secretary on the morning of March 26th, and received from him an
                            informal memorandum regarding the question of establishing an export
                            control. As enclosures hereto, you will find the Spanish text and
                            translation of the informal memorandum in question.<note n="37"
                                xml:id="d326fn1">Not printed.</note> I would like to point out to
                            the Department the very friendly tone of the memorandum as well as the
                            wholesome desire expressed therein to cooperate with us.</p>
                        <p>In a nutshell, the essence of the informal note in question is as
                            follows: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>—The Mexican Government is willing and has the legal means to
                                    exercise an export control, but, prior to doing so, it feels
                                    that it is <pb n="405" xml:id="pg_405" facs="0413"
                                    />indispensable to receive from the United States the assurance
                                    that it could sell the products under control in the American
                                    market under conditions favorable to its economy and that the
                                    prices of such products would not be inferior to those
                                    prevailing in North American markets.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>—If the above assurance can be given, then, the Mexican
                                    Government will enact the laws necessary for the export control
                                    of some articles.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>—The Mexican Government feels that the above agreement could
                                    be made by a simple exchange of notes and that discussions
                                    between the Mexican Department of Foreign Relations and the
                                    Embassy could determine the characteristics of the agreement and
                                    the products to be included.</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>—The Mexican Government will not find it inconvenient to
                                    prohibit the re-exportation from Mexico of articles imported
                                    from the United States and which are subject to United States
                                    export control.</item>
                                <label>5.</label>
                                <item>—However, the Mexican Government points out its need for
                                    continuing to receive with regularity and promptness many
                                    articles which are on the United States Export Control List with
                                    particular reference to iron (ingots and scrap) and machinery
                                    and would welcome the assurances of the American Government in
                                    this respect.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>Apart from the contents of the informal memorandum from the Foreign
                            Office, the Sub-secretary brought up the question of petroleum. He said
                            that shipments to Japan had been completely discontinued since last
                            December and that the only existing outlet for Mexican petroleum of any
                            consequence is now in the United States. Mr. Bodet said that the Mexican
                            quota under the Venezuelan Treaty was increased only 1,000,000 barrels
                            for this year over last year. He said that his Government felt that in
                            view of the very close cooperation between our Governments, it was hoped
                            the United States would reconsider the oil quota to Mexico and enlarge
                            it materially. The Under-Secretary emphasized quite strongly the
                            necessity for Mexico to find a larger petroleum market in the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>The Under-Secretary also said that any suggestions from the American
                            Government in reference to the characteristics of an export control
                            would be welcome.</p>
                        <p>In summary, the informal memorandum from the Under-Secretary means that
                            Mexico is ready to exercise an export control after the products are
                            agreed upon and assurances have been given to the effect that the United
                            States will absorb the controlled products under favorable conditions
                            and at prices prevailing in the North American markets. I await your
                            further advice in this matter.</p>
                        <p>Respectfully yours,</p>

                        <p>218. Reference is made to the Embassy’s despatch no. 12463 of March 26,
                            1941. The Federal Loan Agency has now indicated its willingness to enter
                            into an agreement with the Mexican Government on the following terms: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>The Mexican Government would agree to establish a system of
                                    export control. Such export control would prohibit the
                                    exportation to countries other than the United States and the
                                    other American republics, which have established parallel
                                    systems of export control, of the following materials: antimony,
                                    arsenic, bismuth, cadmium, cobalt, copper, fluorspar, graphite,
                                    henequen, lead, manganese, mercury, mica, molybdenum, tin,

                                <item>The Federal Loan Agency, through its subsidiaries, will agree
                                    to purchase all the Mexican supplies of these materials
                                    available for export which may not be absorbed by the American
                                    market through ordinary commercial channels. The amounts of the
                                    exportable surplus will be specified in the agreement at a
                                    figure slightly higher than the present exportable
                                    surplus.</item>

                                <item>It is contemplated that the contract would be for a term of 2
                                    years. In addition, it is suggested that provision be made for
                                    the extension of the period at the option of the Federal Loan
                                    Agency.</item>

                            City with full power to negotiate an agreement covering the above points
                            with the Mexican Government.</p>

                            military aircraft. Copies of the agreement have already been informally
                            furnished the War and Navy Departments for their strictly confidential
                            information. It will be recalled that as a result of conversations
                            between officers of the War and Navy Departments and Mexican Army and
                            Navy officers, decision was reached in principle for the agreement in
                            question. Thereafter, the Mexican Embassy presented to this Department a
                            draft of agreement which, with modifications, became the agreement just
                            signed. Officers of the War Department and the Navy Department were
                            consulted by this Department in connection with the draft and changes
                            made therein.</p>
                        <p>The Department of State views the agreement as an important step in the
                            development of friendship, cooperation and defense collaboration between
                            the two countries, and it is further believed that the reaching of the
                            agreement reflects most favorably upon the good neighbor policy, as well
                            as upon the tact and skill of the Army and Navy officials of the two
                            countries who made this agreement possible.</p>
                        <p>In view of the fact that an agreement of this character presents a number
                            of difficult and delicate Mexican domestic political problems and also
                            in the interest of the harmonious working and continuance of the
                            agreement, I venture to recommend most strongly that your Department
                            omit no step to prevent any untoward incidents arising from the use of
                            the facilities referred to in the agreement. For instance, it is felt
                            that at least in the first few weeks of operations under the convention,
                            every effort should be made to hold to a minimum the number of flights
                            over and landings in Mexico. It is particularly important that the
                            officers and men participating in the flights be very tactful in their
                            dealings with Mexican officials and civilians with whom they may come in
                            contact. Likewise, I am confident that any Mexican flights entering the
                            United States under the agreement will receive the most courteous
                            treatment and the benefit of all facilities which this country may
                            properly extend.</p>
                        <p>It might be desirable to have the first flight under the agreement, after
                            its ratification, made into the United States by Mexican aircraft in
                            order that it may be demonstrated to the Mexican public that the
                            agreement works both ways. At the time of such a flight, if arranged,
                            the War or Navy Department may see fit to arrange appropriate ceremonies
                            of a modest character symbolical of the friendship, and brotherhood in
                            defense, of the military forces of the two countries.</p>

                                166.</note> regarding the leases. It is a lengthy statement of the
                            Panamanian position largely along the lines already known to the
                            Department. I shall transmit the text and a translation by direct air
                            mail due in Washington Friday morning. The essential points are as
                            follows: The Panamanian Government hopes that the Department will
                            reconsider its offer and grant Panama a reasonable price for the leases
                            more in consonance with the burdens, dangers, and moral sacrifices which
                            they entail for Panama. It insists that the United States shall have
                            jurisdiction only over military personnel. It states that if the grant
                            of new lands is made in the spirit of articles II and X of the 1936
                                treaty<note n="6" xml:id="d333fn6">General treaty of friendship and
                                cooperation between the United States and Panama, signed at

                                    889</ref> ff.</note> it follows that once the unforeseen
                            contingency or threat of aggression disappears the lands are no longer
                            required and revert to Panama; that it is inconceivable that the
                            unforeseen contingency or threat of aggression last more than 6 years
                            and that consequently leases for a longer period would not be justified;
                            but that if they did still exist the leases could <pb n="415"
                                xml:id="pg_415" facs="0423"/>surely be extended and that in such an
                            event no Panamanian Government would object to their extension.</p>
                        <p>Immediately after receiving the <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> I had
                            a long personal interview alone with President Arias. I referred to the
                            seriousness of the world situation as set forth in President Roosevelt’s
                            recent speeches, to the great urgency of providing for the defense of
                            the Canal, and to recent unfavorable comments concerning Panama in the
                            American press. I urged upon him the extreme desirability of early
                            action not only because of the existing emergency but also in order to
                            place Panama in a better light. I told the President that the <hi
                                rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> which I had just received would
                            prove very disappointing to the Department and that I had hoped to be
                            able to advise it that the Panamanian Government was prepared to include
                                [<hi rend="italic">conclude?</hi>] the leases on terms satisfactory
                            to the United States. He said that as respects the <hi rend="italic"
                                >aide-mémoire</hi> it was a [statement of?] Panama’s position which
                            the Government must place on record for its own and the country’s
                            protection. Speaking unofficially, he said that it was fully agreed in
                            principle that Panama would make the tracts available, that we would of
                            course obtain them, that he realized fully that if necessary we would
                            proceed to occupy them, and that I could telegraph the Department that
                            the Panamanian Government was prepared to negotiate leases on mutually
                            satisfactory terms.</p>
                        <p>He said that he would like to have the new Panamanian Ambassador in
                                Washington<note n="7" xml:id="d333fn7">Carlos N. Brin.</note> have
                            an opportunity to discuss the whole matter with the Department and if
                            possible with President Roosevelt. He said that he had never thought for
                            a minute of holding us up in connection with the leases but that as a
                            patriotic Panamanian he considered it his duty to defend to the utmost
                            the interests of his little country. Speaking with great frankness he
                            stated that he did not see how he could go before the National Assembly
                            and propose leases based on the Department’s recent terms, but that on
                            the other hand if he were in a position to tell the Assembly that Panama
                            is to receive some further advantage, not necessarily in the form of
                            direct compensation for the leases, he was confident that matters could
                            be arranged rapidly and that with the Assembly’s approval authorization
                            could be granted the Army to undertake preliminary work on the
                            preparation of defense positions without awaiting formal conclusion of
                            the leases. As possible concession for the Department’s consideration
                            the President mentioned the improvement of that portion of the national
                            highway lying between Sona and David.</p>

                            balboas does not appear to represent only the fair value of the
                            privately-owned land within the leased areas. Other considerations of a
                            wider scope are those which have weighed in the minds of both
                            Governments and explain and justify the agreements signed. These
                            considerations are very similar to those which at present motivate the
                            request made by the Government of Washington of the Government of Panamá
                            for the establishment of air bases and electric detectors and
                            searchlights at different points in the Republic; and for that reason it
                            appears logical to hope that, in fixing the rental price for the areas
                            required for such purposes, the same criterion will be applied which
                            inspired the arrangements recently effected between the United States
                            and Great Britain.</p>
                        <p>Panamá is ready to cooperate in the general defense of the Hemisphere;
                            but it must necessarily abide by the interpretation which all the
                            American nations have given to this commitment, according to which such
                            cooperation cannot involve any obligation affecting the sovereignty or
                            the political independence of an American State.</p>
                        <p>It cannot be denied that in the defense of the Western Hemisphere in
                            which the United States is so nobly engaged, the Isthmus is a
                            beneficiary; but so is the United States, in the first instance, and the
                            remaining countries of the Continent. And there is no just reason why
                            Panamá, one of the smallest and poorest of the American Republics,
                            should bear all the burdens without any appreciable benefit.</p>
                        <p>The Canal defense plan, prepared by the United States War and Navy
                            Departments, represents practically the military occupation of the
                            Isthmus by North American armed forces, and this circumstance cannot be
                            considered and accepted by the Republic of Panamá as a result of the
                            obligation incumbent upon it in the defense of the Hemisphere. No
                            Panamanian citizen would have signed a commitment having such a scope
                            and no Latin American nation would ask of Panamá such a sacrifice, if
                            they were consulted.</p>
                        <p>2. Although it is true that in the last paragraph of Article 2 of the
                            General Treaty between Panamá and the United States signed in <pb
                                n="417" xml:id="pg_417" facs="0425"/>1936 both countries “recognize
                            their joint obligation to insure the effective and continuous operation
                            of the Canal and the preservation of its neutrality”, it is also true
                            that this obligation, as respects “the utilization of lands or waters
                            additional to those already employed” only binds the Government of the

                            be otherwise, since in the first paragraph of the same article “the

                        <p>With regard to the application of Article 10 of the General Treaty the
                            point of view of the Department of State merits the most careful
                            attention and respect. Nevertheless, the present situation, however
                            difficult it may be, does not seem yet to present an imminent threat of
                            aggression “which would endanger the security of the Republic of Panamá
                            or the neutrality or security of the Canal” justifying measures
                            affecting the territory under the jurisdiction of the Panamanian
                            Government without adequate compensation for the consequent burdens and
                            sacrifices.</p>
                        <p>The cooperation which Panamá offers the North American people “nobly and
                            sincerely”, as His Excellency the President of the Republic, Dr. Arnulfo
                            Arias, expressed it in beautiful words in his recent address, is
                            inspired by the very deep desire of giving particular effect to the
                            “good neighbor” policy, which honors so signally His Excellency
                            President Franklin D. Roosevelt, rather than by the contractual
                            obligations to which the Isthmus and the great Nation of the North are
                            parties.</p>
                        <p>3. The Government of Panamá has learned with real pain of the slight
                            importance which the Government of the United States seems to attach to
                            the sacrifice which the concession of further lands means for the
                            Isthmus. Their intrinsic value cannot serve as a basis for lease
                            negotiations between two sovereign countries, because their value is not
                            the same in the international sphere. Panamá would never grant to any
                            country at any price the use of any part of its territory; and it is
                            only by virtue of the special relations which bind it to the United
                            States that it agrees to consider with sympathy the request made by the
                            Government of Washington.</p>
                        <pb n="418" xml:id="pg_418" facs="0426"/>
                        <p>It is hoped that the Department of State, in a broadly comprehensive
                            spirit, will reconsider its offer and grant to Panamá a reasonable price
                            for the projected leases more in consonance with the burdens, dangers
                            and moral sacrifices which such concessions impose upon the country.</p>
                        <p>4. The jurisdiction which the United States shall exercise over the
                            leased areas must be defined precisely before the drafting of the
                            contracts. The Government of Panamá insists that the Government of the
                            United States shall have jurisdiction only over military personnel on
                            duty in the leased areas and that all other persons residing therein,
                            whatever their nationality may be, shall be under Panamanian
                            jurisdiction.</p>
                        <p>5. If the grant of new lands is made in the spirit of Articles 2 and 10
                            of the Treaty of 1936, cited by the Department of State, we must agree
                            that once there has disappeared the “unforeseen contingency” or the
                            “threat of aggression which would endanger the neutrality or security of
                            the Canal”, “the sites required for the purpose of defending the
                            neutrality or security of the Canal” are no longer necessary and their
                            utilization must revert to the Republic of Panamá. It is not conceivable
                            that the “unforeseen contingency” or “threat of aggression” last more
                            than six years and consequently contracts for a longer period would not
                            be justified under these clauses. However, if the “unforeseen
                            contingency” or the “threat of aggression” should still be imminent, the
                            contracts could most surely be extended. It is not possible that in
                            cases such as these any Panamanian Government would object to the
                            extension of the contracts in question.</p>

                        <p>4. Your 6, January 7, 3 p.m. Since it cannot now be foreseen how long the
                            United States will desire to use the lands now desired for defense, the
                            Department tentatively believes that an annual rental rather than a lump
                            sum payment would form a better basis for negotiation. If you concur,
                            please discuss this with the Commanding General<note n="12"

                        <p>The Ambassador of Panama called to see me today to make his first visit
                            upon me since his arrival in Washington. I greeted the Ambassador very
                            cordially and told him that I knew well of his brilliant professional
                            career and of the magnificent surgical work which he had undertaken at
                            the hospital in Panama.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador commenced the interview by requesting the services of
                            certain technicians, which question is dealt with in a separate
                                memorandum.<note n="13" xml:id="d336fn13">Not printed.</note></p>
                        <p>I inquired of the Ambassador whether he had any recent information as to
                            the status of the negotiations between the representatives of this
                            Government and the Panamanian Government for the acquisition of sites
                            outside of the Canal Zone to be utilized for defense purposes by the
                            Canal authorities. The Ambassador said that he understood that progress
                            had been made but that certain basic questions still remained to be
                            settled and he thereupon requested that I arrange for the President to
                            receive him in order that he might take up some of these problems with
                            the President<note n="14" xml:id="d336fn14">See memorandum of February
                                18, <ref target="#pg_430">p. 430</ref>.</note> by instruction of
                            President Arias.</p>
                        <p>I replied to the Ambassador that I would be very glad to communicate his
                            request to the White House and that I would let him know when a reply
                            was received. I then asked the Ambassador what these basic difficulties
                            might be. The Ambassador replied that the Government of Panama desired
                            to obtain more tangible and greater benefits for the people of Panama in
                            return for the additional defense sites which would be granted in
                            Panamanian territory than the mere compensation for the lands taken
                            over. The Ambassador said that public opinion in Panama did not favor
                            the granting of these additional sites if Panama did not really benefit
                            therefrom. He said that the Government of Panama fully recognized its
                            obligation under the treaty of 1936 to agree with the Government of the
                            United States upon the granting in Panamanian territory of any
                            additional sites required for the defense of the Canal, but that it
                            could not agree to <pb n="420" xml:id="pg_420" facs="0428"/>grant these
                            additional sites, which he claimed were seventy-seven in number, for a
                            period of ninety-nine years. He said that the Republic of Panama was
                            small in extent but the location of these sites comprised the entire
                            territory of the Republic and would result in making Panama an armed
                            camp for a century unless the term for which these sites were granted
                            were to last solely for the period of the emergency. I replied to this
                            that the Ambassador stated precisely my own belief, namely, that the two
                            countries were bound as partners to take all measures which might be
                            necessary for the proper defense of the Canal and that these additional
                            defense sites now under contemplation were, of course, only to be
                            requested so long as the defense of the Canal made their taking over
                            necessary. I said that it would seem to me that the Government of Panama
                            must recognize, as did this Government, that inventions in modern
                            warfare made necessary types of defense which had not previously been
                            contemplated and that, consequently, it was impossible to predict
                            whether some of these desired sites would have to be retained for an
                            indeterminate period or whether all could be turned back to Panamanian
                            occupation immediately after the present international conflagration had
                            been extinguished.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador seemed to agree with this statement of principle and
                            reiterated the desire of Panama to cooperate in every possible way for
                            the defense of the Canal.</p>
                        <p>I then inquired of the Ambassador what the tangible and material
                            advantages, which the Ambassador had stated should accrue to Panama,
                            might be. The Ambassador then mentioned the construction of a tunnel
                            under the Canal to relieve the congestion of traffic between one side of
                            the Republic and the other; the donation of the Panama Railway lots to
                            the Panamanian Government; the removal of the railroad station in Panama
                            City to a site which would not impede the improvement of the capital;
                            and the immediate relinquishment of the aqueduct and waterworks to the
                            Government of Panama.</p>
                        <p>Certain of these desiderata were discussed in some slight detail and I
                            then said to the Ambassador that in order to save time in the
                            consideration of these proposals, it would be well for the Ambassador to
                            send me in memorandum form the list of these requests of his Government.
                            The Ambassador said that he would send me such a memorandum at the
                            earliest possible moment.</p>
                        <p>Before he left the Ambassador again stated that President Arias was
                            sincerely desirous of working in the closest harmony and cooperation
                            with the United States and that if such were not the case, the
                            Ambassador would not have relinquished his flourishing practice in
                            Panama in order to accept the mission as Ambassador in Washington. Dr.

                        <p>The Ambassador of Panama called to see me this afternoon at my
                            request.</p>
                        <p>I told the Ambassador that I had submitted to the President the
                            Ambassador’s request for an audience in order to submit to the President
                            in the name of the President of Panama a series of very far-reaching
                            suggestions which, if carried out, would imply the turning over by the
                            Government of the United States of a great many millions of dollars. I
                            said to the Ambassador that the President had requested me to inform him
                            that due to the heavy pressure of official business at this time, the
                            President was unable to receive him for the moment, but that the
                            President, of course, would be glad to see him later on. I said that the
                            President had also requested me to say that he believed that in view of
                            the explicit treaty obligations of Panama contracted in the Treaty of
                            1936 with the United States, the Government of Panama should immediately
                            proceed to make available to the Canal authorities the sites outside of
                            the Zone required for the defense of the Canal and agree upon equitable
                            and full compensation therefor. I said that in the judgment of the
                            President the world situation was grave and speed in turning over to the
                            Canal authorities the defense sites necessary was of the utmost
                            importance. Finally, the President requested me to say that when Panama
                            had in this manner complied with the treaty obligations, this Government
                            would be very glad to consider any suggestions for further cooperation
                            between Panama and the United States which Panama desired to
                            present.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador argued at very great length. He brought up the same
                            questions which had arisen during past years alleging that the
                            commissariats were depriving the people of Panama of their just
                            commercial advantages, that the roads of Panama were being destroyed by
                            the military forces of the Canal Zone which were using them, et cetera,
                            et cetera.</p>
                        <p>I went into a long exposition of this Government’s policy which had been
                            manifested by its willingness to negotiate the Treaty of <pb n="422"
                                xml:id="pg_422" facs="0430"/>1936. I said to the Ambassador that I
                            did not believe there was another government in the world that would
                            have been willing voluntarily, through a treaty negotiation, to
                            relinquish some of the rights accruing to it under the Treaty of 1903. I
                            said that this Government had done that because of its desire to show
                            the Panamanian people its true friendship through willingness to
                            relinquish to the Panamanian people all commercial and material
                            advantages possible in connection with the operation of the Canal, and
                            at the same time, what was perhaps even more important, to remove from
                            the Treaty of 1903 all of the provisions which had in any way appeared
                            to be derogatory to the Republic of Panama as an independent and
                            sovereign nation. I said the one advantage, in my opinion, that had been
                            obtained from the Treaty of 1936 was that both Governments recognized
                            their joint obligations as partners to defend and operate the Canal. I
                            said that as a partner in this enterprise, Panama was now obligated to
                            make possible the efficient defense of the Canal, particularly in this
                            grave world emergency. I said I could not for a moment concede that
                            Panama required any further compensation in order to carry out these
                            obligations.</p>
                        <p>I stated that when the Treaty of 1936 had been ratified, the then
                            Government of Panama, through its official representatives, had informed
                            me that Panama believed that all of its just aspirations had been fully
                            met. I said it would be an intolerable situation if, with every new
                            administration that came into power in Panama, this Government found
                            itself required to pay vast sums to Panama in the nature of new
                            concessions as a means of persuading Panama to carry out her treaty
                            obligations.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then blandly made the suggestion by instruction of his
                            Government, that the United States advance to Panama all of the Canal
                            annuities for the next fifty years. The Ambassador said that in this way
                            the American bondholders could all be paid off and Panama would be able
                            to relieve her economic situation. I said that this situation to my mind
                            was inconceivable and that I could not comprehend the reference to the
                            economic situation of Panama since, to my knowledge, Panama was the only
                            one of the twenty-one American Republics which today was in a highly
                            prosperous situation and that this was due entirely to the work on the
                            Canal which had been undertaken at the expense of the Government of the
                            United States, the money being spent on this work accruing, of course,
                            to the benefit of Panama and likewise making possible the employment of
                            practically every employable Panamanian citizen.</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of our conversation, I summarized by saying that I
                            desired to impress upon the Ambassador, by instruction of the President,
                            the belief of this Government that the Government of <pb n="423"
                                xml:id="pg_423" facs="0431"/>Panama should immediately reach an
                            agreement in Panama with the Canal authorities so that the defense sites
                            necessary might be turned over to the Canal authorities. I said that if
                            this were agreed to, I would be very glad to initiate discussions with
                            the Ambassador covering the points raised in his memorandum but with the
                            definite statement on my part that this willingness to discuss these
                            points in no sense implied any responsibility on the part of this
                            Government to accede to any one of them. I said that this Government
                            during the past eight years had time and again, in a material way and in
                            a very practical way, shown its desire to cooperate to the advantage of
                            Panama and that this policy would continue. I said that this policy was
                            inherently reciprocal and required reciprocal consideration on the part
                            of the Government of Panama for the legitimate requirements of the Canal
                            and for the legitimate interests of the United States.</p>
                        <p>I took occasion to say to the Ambassador that Secretary Hull had told me
                            that he would like to have a talk with him on this same matter and that
                            I had no doubt that an appointment would be arranged for the Ambassador
                            by the Secretary’s office.</p>

                                Ambassador as follows: “You may inform General Van Voorhis of the
                                above; and inquire of President Arias what steps the Panamanian
                                Government may have in mind to expedite the availability of the
                                lands in question.” (711 F.1914/178a)</note> As General Van Voorhis
                            leaves Saturday for about a week he and I sought an immediate interview
                            with the President which was granted this morning. It appeared that
                            little or no information had been received from Ambassador Brin
                            concerning his conversation with the Under-Secretary. I communicated
                            verbally to the President the substance of the Department’s telegram
                            omitting point 4<note n="16" xml:id="d338fn16">See fifth paragraph of
                                memorandum of January 31, <hi rend="italic">supra</hi>.</note> and
                            inquired what steps the Panamanian Government might have in mind to
                            expedite the availability of the lands. The President said that the
                            matter would have to be taken up with the Cabinet and National Assembly
                            and that it would be greatly facilitated if only he could point to
                            something that Panama was receiving in return.</p>
                        <p>The General and I reminded him of what Panama was already receiving and
                            made it very clear that Panama’s further [aspirations?] <pb n="424"
                                xml:id="pg_424" facs="0432"/>would be considered only after
                            compliance with its obligations and that the best means of expediting
                            their consideration by our Government would be to expedite the
                            availability of the lands. In conclusion the President said that he
                            would proceed to take the matter up with the Cabinet and the National
                            Assembly and in this connection he requested that I give him something
                            in writing preferably before the next Cabinet meeting on Tuesday. He
                            requested specifically that it contain a reference to the highway known
                            as access road P–8 for which General Van Voorhis already has funds
                            available.</p>
                        <p>I respectfully request that the Department inform me whether it would
                            approve a communication along the following lines: <quote

                        <p>21. Your 22, February 6, 4 p.m. The Under Secretary has had a further
                            conversation with the Panamanian Ambassador regarding the leases of
                            defense sites. Dr. Brin stated that his Government was prepared to
                            proceed at once with the leases. He took occasion, however, to raise the
                            question of the impairment to the sovereignty of Panama which his
                            Government thought might occur if jurisdiction were accorded the United
                            States over the desired lands. The Under Secretary stated that this
                            point of view was entirely theoretical; that the United States does not
                            feel that its jurisdiction over the Canal Zone will be impaired by
                            granting Panama jurisdiction over the <pb n="425" xml:id="pg_425"
                                facs="0433"/>precincts of the proposed Panama customhouses in the
                            Canal Zone. The Ambassador finally appeared to agree.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the term of the leases, the Ambassador stated that
                            President Arias did not wish to grant the leases for a term longer than
                            that of his administration or, in any event, that term plus one
                            additional year.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary stated that this Government could not consent to that
                            thesis; that the obligation to cooperate in this manner for the defense
                            of the Canal was undertaken not by any particular administrations in
                            Panama, but by the Republic of Panama; that the lands should be leased
                            for so long a period as the two Governments consider their use necessary
                            to the defense of the Canal.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the communication to be delivered to President Arias,
                            the Department considers the following text to be preferable: <quote

                                        >aide-mémoire</hi> of December 30 last, the Ambassador of
                                    the United States of America has the honor to state that the
                                    Government of the United States considers that, with the coming
                                    into effect of the general treaty, it has generously met the
                                    aspirations of Panama to take full advantage of its geographical
                                    position in relation to the Canal, while at the same time the
                                    Republic of Panama has undertaken to cooperate in the defense of
                                    the Canal. The Government of the United States therefore
                                    considers that with regard to the leasing of lands required for
                                    that defense, Panama should make these sites available
                                    immediately and that the Panamanian and Canal Zone authorities
                                    should agree upon an equitable annual rental therefor, based on
                                    the fair value of the desired lands.</p>
                                <p>“Upon the compliance by the Government of Panama with its treaty
                                    obligations in this respect, the Government of the United States
                                    will be glad to give friendly and careful consideration to the
                                    suggestions for assistance advanced by the Government of

                        <p>For your confidential information, the Department will consider carefully
                            which of the various “compensations” which have been proposed by Panama
                            it might be willing to grant as “friendly gestures”. It might, for
                            example, favor the removal of the railway station and the construction
                            of certain highway projects, including the P–8 road, as well, possibly,
                            as maintenance of roads used during the period of the emergency to an
                            unusual degree by our armed forces. It is not desired to offer the
                            construction of the P–8 road in any way as an inducement to Panama to
                            make the defense sites available and reference to this road should

                        <p>25. Department’s telegram No. 21 of February 8, [5 p.m.]. On Monday I
                            delivered to the Secretary General of the Presidency a communication
                            following precisely the text set forth in the Department’s telegram
                            under reference. The matter was considered by the President and Cabinet
                            on Tuesday and in a long conference commenced yesterday and continued
                            today the Minister of Foreign Relations gave me the Government’s reply
                            which at my request he set forth today in writing in a communication of
                            which the following is a close translation:</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>In our conference which lasted in all over 3 hours the Minister reviewed
                            at great length the Panamanian position and arguments, principally as
                            set forth in his <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> of January 7, and
                            in turn I expressed in the strongest terms our own position and our
                            views regarding Panama’s clear obligations under the treaty. I made
                            every effort to dispel the Minister’s apprehension touching present and
                            future effects on Panama’s sovereignty and to convince him that prompt
                            compliance with our request was not only Panama’s duty but also in its
                            own best interest. The new points developed in our conversation may be
                            summarized as follows.</p>
                        <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>The Minister complained that instead of furnishing a reasoned
                                reply to his <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> of January 7 we had
                                responded with what was almost an ultimatum.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>He said that Ambassador Brin had been unable to discuss Panama’s
                                aspirations with President Roosevelt whereas President Arias had
                                received me repeatedly as well as General Van Voorhis. I reminded
                                him that the Under Secretary had told the Panamanian Ambassador that
                                the President would receive him later.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>The Minister suggested the desirability of a personal conference
                                between the two Presidents as the best means of settling promptly
                                all pending problems. Speaking personally although undoubtedly with
                                the knowledge of the President and Cabinet he said that he was
                                confident that an invitation from President Roosevelt to visit
                                Washington would be accepted by President Arias. To this I made no
                                reply other than that in my opinion Panama must first settle
                                satisfactorily the question of making available the lands required
                                for defense purposes.</item>

                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>I told the Minister that I regretted deeply having to send my
                                Government such a reply as he had given me and that this reply and
                                his statement regarding Panama’s interpretation of its treaty
                                obligations seemed to be in contradiction with the Panamanian
                                position thus far and the Government’s many protestations of its
                                desire to cooperate.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>He replied that Panama’s interpretation of the treaty had been set forth
                            in his <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> of January 7 and that its
                            position from the outset had been dictated by its friendly desire to
                            cooperate rather than by any obligation under the treaty. He asserted
                            that both articles II and X contemplate contingencies or emergencies of
                            a temporary nature which could not justify a demand for 99-year leases
                            and that if Panama acceded to our request as at present formulated there
                            would be created a precedent authorizing the permanent military
                            occupation of the tracts under discussion and of further lands as
                            requested from time to time by our military authorities. In spite of my
                            arguments and assurances to the contrary he maintained that this would
                            place the country in virtually the same situation as obtained prior to
                            1936. The Minister said that if the Government of the United States were
                            to inform the Government of Panama that there exists a threat of
                            aggression in the sense of article X and if it based thereon a request
                            for lands for defensive purposes to be made available for the duration
                            of such a threat or emergency, then quite a different situation would
                            exist.</p>

                        <p>27. My telegram No. 25 of February 13. In a conversation which I have
                            just had with President Arias he assured me and authorized me to assure
                            the Department that if the Government of the United States informs the
                            Government of Panama that there exists a threat of aggression

                            treaty and bases thereon its request for the lands needed for the
                            defense of the Canal, the Government of Panama in compliance with
                            article X will make the tracts available immediately for the duration of
                            the emergency. The President said that such a statement on the part of
                            our Government would enable him to place the matter before the Assembly
                            in a manner assuring its approval and that of public opinion.</p>

                                <p>The Government of the United States has likewise reached the
                                    conclusion that, in accordance with the terms of Article X of
                                    the Treaty of 1936 above quoted, an international conflagration
                                    has broken out bringing with it the existence of a threat to the
                                    security of the Panama Canal which requires the taking of
                                    measures for the defense of the Canal on the part of the
                                    Government of the United States.</p>
                                <p>These measures of defense require the utilization of certain
                                    tracts of land within the territory of the Republic of Panama
                                    and outside of the Canal Zone, which tracts have been indicated
                                    to the Government of Panama by the appropriate authorities of
                                    the United States.</p>
                                <p>The Government of the United States therefore requests of the
                                    Government of Panama that, for the reasons above cited and in
                                    accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of 1936 above
                                    quoted, the Government of Panama transfer to the authorities of
                                    the United States the said tracts of land at the earliest
                                    opportunity. The Government of the United States stands ready,
                                    in accordance with the spirit of cooperation which animates both
                                    Governments, to consult immediately with the Government of

                                    for the lands whose utilization is now required.</p>
                                <p>The Government of the United States takes pleasure in stating
                                    that when and if the conditions which have now arisen and which
                                    require the utilization of the said tracts of land for the
                                    defense of the Panama Canal or for its effective protection

                                    to the jurisdiction of the Republic of Panama the tracts of land

                            cannot be regarded as forming any part of the discussions relating to
                            the carrying out by the Republic of Panama of the treaty obligations

                                    Treaty of 1936 have not produced the hoped-for result, more than
                                    anything else because of the changed situation brought about by
                                    the influx of immigrants for the construction of the third set

                        <p>32. Department’s telegram No. 27 of February 17. The Minister of Foreign
                            Relations handed me an <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> today and
                            stated that President Arias desired that it be communicated to President

                            I handed him on February 18. I shall forward the Spanish text of the

                                    according to which the Government of the United States affirms

                                    conflagration has broken out bringing with it the existence of a

                                    that in question would be incumbent upon Panama, is willing to
                                    grant to the Government of the United States the utilization of

                                    the United States.</p>
                                <p>In accordance with the spirit which inspires article II of the
                                    General Treaty, by which the United States renounced the
                                    acquisition of new lands and waters in the Isthmus, and the
                                    spirit of article X of the same treaty which contemplates the
                                    use of new lands in exceptional cases and in a temporary manner,
                                    it is hoped that the Government of the United States will be
                                    willing to agree that once the present international
                                    conflagration has terminated the lands in question will revert
                                    to the Republic.</p>
                                <p>Likewise, it is hoped that the Government of the United States
                                    will consider the reasons set forth by the Government of Panama
                                    in the course of the conversations which have been held
                                    regarding the jurisdiction which the American authorities would
                                    exercise over the leased lands, and that it will agree that the
                                    said jurisdiction will be exercised only over its military
                                    personnel on duty.</p>
                                <p>The Government of the Republic of Panama has received with
                                    particular pleasure the assurance which the Government of the
                                    United States has given it of its readiness to establish by
                                    common accord the proposed compensation which may be
                                    appropriate.</p>
                                <p>If the Government of the United States accepts the general bases
                                    which this <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> contains, the
                                    Government of Panama will proceed without loss of time to
                                    authorize the preliminary preparation of the lands, and in
                                    accordance with the spirit of cooperation which animates the two
                                    Governments, will then begin to study and determine the terms of
                                    the pertinent agreements.</p>
                                <p>The new spirit of understanding and sincere friendship which
                                    distinguishes the <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> of the
                                    Embassy of the United States of the 18th of February has been
                                    very satisfactory to the Government of Panama. It is pleasing
                                    that the good relations happily existing between both peoples
                                    are closer and deeper each day and that the differences of
                                    environment to which they are necessarily exposed by reason of
                                    the interests of both countries, find an adequate solution,
                                    always friendly, which reaffirms more and more the sentiments of
                                    solidarity and cooperation which the two Governments desire
                                    keenly to preserve.”</p>

                                <p>The Government of the Republic of Panama states that if the
                                    Government of the United States would be willing to agree that
                                    once the present international conflagration has terminated, the
                                    additional lands now urgently required by the United States for
                                    the defense of the Panama Canal, will revert to the Republic;
                                    and that if the Government of the United States will further
                                    agree that jurisdiction by authorities of the United States over
                                    such lands will be exercised only over the military personnel of
                                    the United States on duty ‘the Government of Panama will proceed
                                    without loss of time to authorize the preliminary preparation of
                                    the lands, and in accordance with the spirit of cooperation
                                    which animates the two Governments, will then begin to study and

                                <p>With reference to the former of the two desires expressed by the
                                    Government of Panama, the Government of the United States
                                    reiterates the statement contained in the <hi rend="italic"
                                        >aide-mémoire</hi> transmitted to the Government of Panama

                                            stating that when and if the conditions which have now
                                            arisen and which require the utilization of the said
                                            tracts of land for the defense of the Panama Canal or

                                <p>With reference to the second of the two desires expressed by the
                                    Government of Panama, the Government of the United States draws
                                    the attention of the Government of Panama to the fact that the
                                    latter is granted full jurisdiction by the United States within
                                    the customs houses to be set up by the Republic of Panama within
                                    the Canal Zone by virtue of the Treaty between the two
                                    Governments signed on March 2, 1936. The Government of the
                                    United States was glad to enter into this agreement because of
                                    its realization that in order to make it possible for the
                                    Government of Panama effectively to administer its customs
                                    services within these customs houses, the authorities of the
                                    Republic of Panama within the customs houses must be accorded
                                    full jurisdiction within those sites.</p>
                                <p>It is for exactly the same kind of a practical reason that the
                                    Government of the United States must be assured of adequate
                                    jurisdiction within the defense sites now required. The question
                                    is solely of a practical nature and carries with it no
                                    implication of any infringement of sovereignty. Its principal
                                    and obvious purpose is to safeguard military installations
                                    within the sites from possible espionage and sabotage.</p>
                                <p>The Government of the United States, accordingly, desires to
                                    propose that the question of jurisdiction over the necessary
                                    defense sites shall be regulated by an agreement between the two
                                    Governments as follows: <pb n="434" xml:id="pg_434" facs="0442"/>

                                    above suggested agreement.</p>
                                <p>Several months have already passed since the Government of the
                                    United States requested the Government of Panama, in accordance
                                    with the clear stipulations of Article II and of Article X of
                                    the Treaty of March 2, 1936, to transfer to the appropriate
                                    authorities of the United States the additional sites required
                                    for the defense of the Canal. The effective protection and the
                                    adequate defense of the Canal are problems which involve not
                                    only the security of the Republic of Panama and of the United
                                    States, but the safety of every one of the other American
                                    Republics as well. In view of the present world situation, the
                                    continued operation of the Canal is essential to the economic
                                    well-being of a great number of the American Republics; full and
                                    adequate defense of the Canal is of vital importance in order
                                    that the independence and integrity of the Western Hemisphere
                                    may be rendered unassailable.</p>
                                <p>The Government of the United States finds it necessary in the
                                    most friendly way to request of the Government of Panama that it
                                    authorize not only the ‘preliminary preparation of the lands’
                                    required, but that it likewise transfer immediately to the
                                    proper authorities of the United States these sites in order
                                    that the necessary military preparations may be undertaken by
                                    these authorities without any further delay. As was stated in
                                    the <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> communicated to the
                                    Government of Panama under date of February 18, the Government
                                    of the United States stands ready thereupon to consult with the
                                    Government of Panama in order that an agreement may be had by
                                    the two Governments as to the amounts to be fixed as equitable
                                    compensation for the lands whose utilization is now required for
                                    the defense of the Canal.</p>
                                <p>The Government of the United States feels sure that as a result
                                    of the clarification above set forth, the desired steps will be
                                    immediately taken by the Government of Panama in order to
                                    prevent any further continuation of this delay which has already
                                    proven seriously prejudicial to the adequate protection of the
                                    Canal.”</p>

                            yesterday. This noon he informed me that he had studied the <hi

                            Panamanian Government desires to make available the defense sites

                            Foreign Office. The Minister stated further that for the information of

                            communiqué on Monday afternoon. He said that as soon as these steps have
                            been taken the Government will be prepared to discuss the <hi

                            remarks this morning I believe that he will admit [<hi rend="italic"

                            manifesto to the nation issued by the Panamanian Government this
                            afternoon: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>The Governments of the Republic of Panama and of the United
                                    States of America have recently exchanged ideas at the
                                    initiative of the latter concerning the situation created by the
                                    present European conflagration in so far as it may affect the
                                    security of the Panama Canal. The conversations have been
                                    carried on in a spirit of ample and perfect understanding and in
                                    the light of the Arias–Roosevelt Treaty of March 2, 1936,
                                    harmonizing the fulfillment of its contractual obligations with
                                    the imperious and unavoidable duty of safeguarding its own
                                    sovereign rights the Panamanian Government has considered
                                    carefully the requests of the North American Government. These
                                    requests tend concretely to obtain the use of certain sites
                                    outside <pb n="436" xml:id="pg_436" facs="0444"/>the Canal Zone
                                    and in Panamanian territory for the installation of air bases
                                    and searchlight and detector positions which the Washington
                                    Government considers indispensable for the defense of the said
                                    interoceanic route basing its request on article X of the
                                    treaty. After studying the situation carefully at different
                                    meetings of the Cabinet Council the Government of Panama has
                                    decided to accede to the demands of the Government of the United
                                    States in view of the fact that the latter has reached the
                                    conclusion that in accordance with the terms of article X of the
                                    Treaty of 1936 an international conflagration has broken out
                                    bringing with it the existence of a threat to the security of
                                    the Panama Canal which requires the taking of measures for its
                                    defense on the part of the United States. Concern for the
                                    defense of the legitimate rights of Panama as respects its
                                    territorial integrity and its political independence jointly
                                    with the application of the Treaty of 1936 has led the
                                    Government of the Republic to subordinate the utilization of the
                                    sites requested to certain conditions, among them the
                                    following:</p>
                                <p>In the first place that the North American military authorities
                                    will occupy the said lands only for the duration of the present
                                    European conflagration so that they will be evacuated as soon as
                                    it ends. In the second place that the North American Government
                                    grant that of Panama adequate compensation; and finally the
                                    Republic of Panama exercise jurisdiction over civilians in the
                                    occupied sites in accordance with conditions which in the view
                                    of both governments may be necessary for the defense of the
                                    Canal. In view of the urgency expressed by the Government of the
                                    United States the Government of the Republic of Panama has
                                    permitted the authorities of the Canal Zone to commence the
                                    necessary military preparations. The Panamanian Government
                                    considers that the conditions indicated above and the final
                                    agreements between the two parties directly interested will give
                                    assurance that the future negotiations will be carried on
                                    without the slightest difficulty and in accordance with the
                                    letter and spirit of the Treaty of March 2, 1936.</p>

                        <p>There has been received with particular pleasure the assurance given by
                            the Government of the United States that “when the conditions which have

                            indicated in the statement made by the Government of the United States
                            in the <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> of February 18, which reads:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The Government of the United States has reached the conclusion

                            </quote></p>
                        <p>With respect to the jurisdiction that the Government of the United States
                            would exercise on the above-mentioned areas of land the Government of
                            Panama sees itself constrained to insist on its already known points of
                            view, invariably maintained in its previous communications, whereby the
                            Republic reserves to itself civil jurisdiction over all the lands and
                            cedes to the United States jurisdiction over its military personnel on
                            duty. However, appreciating the apprehension of the United States that
                            acts of espionage or sabotage might endanger the military installations
                            and its desire to protect them adequately against such emergencies, the
                            Government of Panama would agree that crimes of such nature be tried and
                            punished by the competent authorities of the United States.
                            Consequently, the proposed agreement might read as follows: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The Republic of Panama retains its sovereignty and complete

                                    air space, and agrees that during the period of temporary
                                    occupation by the United States the latter has the complete use
                                    of such areas and exclusive jurisdiction over its military
                                    personnel on duty, being empowered, moreover, to try and punish
                                    all persons, without regard to nationality, who in the
                                    above-indicated areas may be apprehended and accused of crimes
                                    of espionage or sabotage.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>The citation which is made in connection with the jurisdiction that the
                            Treaty of 1936 grants to the Government of Panama in the customs houses
                            that the Republic is to establish in the Canal Zone does not appear
                            pertinent inasmuch as these lands have never ceased to belong to the
                            Isthmian Nation and the latter has always retained its sovereignty over
                            them. In the case cited, it is not a question of lands the property of
                            the United States passing to Panamanian jurisdiction and therefore there
                            is no similarity whatever between the concession established by the
                            Treaty of 1936 and that requested of the Panamanian Government for the
                            establishment of the Canal defenses.</p>

                            order, is pleasing.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the Republic of Panama deems it desirable to point out
                            that there has existed on its part no desire to delay the agreement
                            permitting the Government of the United States the utilization of lands
                            necessary for the adequate defense of the Canal, and that the sole
                            reason for this delay must be sought in the original form in which the
                            request of the United States was presented, which did not really accord
                            with the provisions of the General Treaty of 1936. Only in the <hi
                                rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> of February 18 of the Embassy of the
                            United States was the request formulated within the letter and spirit of
                            the contractual obligations devolving upon Panama by reason of the
                            above-mentioned international convention.</p>
                        <p>So sincere and profound is the desire of the Government of Panama to
                            cooperate in the effective defense of the Canal, and so firm its
                            intentions to respect and meet its obligations toward the United States
                            and the entire Western Hemisphere, that “in view of the urgency with
                            which,” according to the statement of the American Government, “these
                            defense sites are needed”, it is ready to authorize immediately the
                            necessary military preparations in the certainty that in a full spirit
                            of understanding and justice its aspirations will be duly considered and
                            received with sympathy in the contracts to be signed later.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the Republic of Panamá will reach an agreement with the
                            military authorities of the Canal Zone to provide the measures which may
                            be required for the indicated purposes.</p>
                        <p>The National Assembly of Panama will be informed of this situation

                                <p>“I was most gratified, as will be all the people of this country
                                    as well as those of our sister republics in this hemisphere, to
                                    learn from the manifesto issued yesterday by the Panamanian
                                    Government that Panama will make available immediately to our
                                    military authorities certain sites in the Republic of Panama
                                    which are considered essential for the protection and security
                                    of the Panama Canal. In taking this <pb n="439" xml:id="pg_439"

                                    partnership in the defense of the Canal which is one of the
                                    fundamentals of the General Treaty between the two countries
                                    ratified in 1939 is a tangible and practical thing.</p>
                                <p>“In accordance with the manifesto, our military authorities will
                                    proceed immediately to the preliminary preparation of these
                                    defense sites. I am confident that the negotiations which are
                                    now in progress with regard to the details involved will be
                                    worked out to the mutual satisfaction of both our

                                <p>“The Government of the United States has received the <hi

                                    the Ambassador of the United States. It is gratified to note
                                    that the Government of Panama, in view of the urgency with which
                                    the military authorities of the United States desire to obtain
                                    the use of certain sites in the Republic of Panama in connection
                                    with the defense of the Panama Canal, is disposed to make these
                                    sites available at once.</p>
                                <p>The Government of the United States has noted with much pleasure
                                    this manifestation of the desire of the Republic of Panama to
                                    cooperate in the defense of the Panama Canal and accepts with
                                    grateful thanks its kind offer to make these sites immediately
                                    available. It has directed its military authorities to proceed
                                    at once with the military preparation of these sites. The
                                    Government of the United States, moreover, is confident that
                                    since agreement has now been reached on the fundamental issue
                                    between the two Governments, the corresponding details may be
                                    rapidly and satisfactorily worked out in a continuing atmosphere
                                    of cordial and mutual understanding.</p>
                                <p>With respect to the question of length of time during which these
                                    sites for the defense of the Panama Canal will be required, the
                                    Government of the United States observes that the Government of
                                    the Republic of Panama has taken due note of the assurance given
                                    by the Government of the United States that ‘when the conditions
                                    which <pb n="440" xml:id="pg_440" facs="0448"/>have now arisen
                                    and which require utilization of the additional lands for the
                                    defense of the Panama Canal cease to exist’, the use of these
                                    lands will revert to the Republic of Panama. The Government of
                                    the United States has been pleased in this connection to give an
                                    assurance to the Republic of Panama that there exists in
                                    accordance with the terms of Article X of the Treaty of 1936 an
                                    ‘international conflagration’ which endangers the security of
                                    the Panama Canal. The Government of the United States likewise
                                    assures the Government of Panama that there exists an
                                    ‘unforeseen contingency’ such as that contemplated in Article II
                                    of the same treaty, under the provisions of which the two
                                    Governments have pledged themselves to agree upon such measures
                                    as may be necessary to insure that additional lands which may be
                                    needed for the effective protection of the Canal shall be made
                                    available. It is with this in mind that the Government of the
                                    United States feels that it cannot consent to the reversion of
                                    the desired lands to Panama as soon as the present
                                    ‘international conflagration’ terminates, for neither Panama nor
                                    the United States can now foresee what new and possibly greater
                                    threats to the security of the Panama Canal might conceivably
                                    follow in the wake of the termination of present hostilities and
                                    thus create new and additional dangers to the Panama Canal, to
                                    the Republic of Panama, to the United States of America, and to
                                    the other countries of this Hemisphere. The Government of the
                                    United States is therefore confident that the Government of
                                    Panama, in strict accordance with the letter and spirit of the
                                    Treaty of 1936, will agree to make the desired lands available
                                    for the duration of the ‘unforseen contingency’ specified in
                                    Article II of that treaty, or for so long as they may be needed
                                    to insure the effective protection of the Panama Canal.</p>
                                <p>With regard to the question of jurisdiction over the desired
                                    sites, the Government of the United States again assures the
                                    Government of the Republic of Panama that, in seeking a measure
                                    of jurisdiction, no impairment of Panamanian sovereignty over
                                    the sites is desired or implied. A practical and workable
                                    measure of jurisdiction, however, to be exercised by the
                                    military authorities of the United States is essential. The
                                    Government of the United States has attentively examined the
                                    counterproposal respecting jurisdiction included in the <hi
                                        rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> of March 5, 1941 but feels
                                    that it can hardly consent to relinquish jurisdiction at any
                                    time over its civil and military personnel on the sites, whether
                                    on duty or not, or over their families. As a practical matter,
                                    moreover, it could not consent to a joint policing of the areas
                                    by the police of the Republic of Panama and the military
                                    authorities of the United States. The Government of the United
                                    States invites the attention of the Republic of Panama to the
                                    fact that since the areas are to be used entirely as military
                                    reservations, it could not consent that its military authorities
                                    would lack the practical and essential authority to arrest and
                                    punish unauthorized persons for trespass thereon. The military
                                    authorities of the United States, however, would be glad to turn
                                    over to the authorities of the Republic of Panama for trial and
                                    punishment all persons other than its own civil and military
                                    personnel and their families apprehended on the sites in the
                                    commission of civil crimes other than that of trespass and of
                                    crimes against the safety and security of the military
                                    installations to be placed on them.</p>
                                <pb n="441" xml:id="pg_441" facs="0449"/>
                                <p>The Government of the United States desires in the most friendly
                                    manner to say that its requirements as to the length of tenure
                                    and jurisdiction as outlined above are a minimum which would be
                                    practical and workable, and it confidently hopes, therefore,
                                    that these minimum requirements will now be acceptable to the
                                    Government of Panama in order that contracts may be speedily
                                    concluded with full agreement as to the details now under
                                    discussion.”</p>

                            which will make more difficult the negotiations with the Panamanian
                            Government, it cannot emphasize too strongly that prompt occupation of
                            the defense sites is now essential.</p>
                        <p>You are requested to seek an interview with the Panamanian Minister of
                            Foreign Affairs or, in your discretion, with the President, and express
                            the great pleasure with which this Government learned from the
                            Panamanian <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> dated March 5, 1941 that
                            the Government of Panama is agreeable to making these sites available at
                            once. You should say that your Government is prepared to cooperate in
                            this regard immediately, and has directed its military authorities to
                            proceed at once with the occupation and preparation of these sites. With
                            this in view, you should add, General Van Voorhis has prepared a
                            schedule of dates on which it would be convenient for detachments from
                            his forces to occupy the desired sites. You should then hand this
                            schedule to the Minister. In order to comply with the formalities
                            desired by the Panamanian Government, he would be pleased to have
                            Panamanian members of the Joint Board accompany the detachments to the
                            various sites and there make formal transfer of the sites. This would
                            appear to be all the formality necessary at this time in as much as the
                            sites have already been visited by competent authority. Since it may not
                            be practicable for both or, in fact, either the Panamanian or American
                            members of the Joint Board to be present on each occasion, more
                            particularly in the case of outlying and remote sites, you should say
                            that your Government would be agreeable to having present at the time of
                            these occupations any representative of the Panamanian Government other
                            than the Panamanian members of the Joint Board who might be designated
                            for the purpose or, in fact, to forego the presence of a Panamanian
                            representative if this better suited the convenience or the desires of
                            the Panamanian Government.</p>
                        <p>For your information, the War Department desires that the transfer <pb
                                n="442" xml:id="pg_442" facs="0450"/>of the sites more urgently
                            needed take place within the next week or 10 days and that arrangements
                            for the transfer of the remaining sites take place when and as the Army
                            is prepared to occupy them.</p>
                        <p>In case, and only in case, the Panamanian Government should inquire when
                            a reply to its <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> of March 5, 1941 may
                            be expected, you may say that this reply is being studied and that it
                            will be transmitted as soon as possible. Meanwhile the Department is
                            confident that the Panamanian Government will agree to the procedure
                            outlined in this telegram so that, in accordance with the clear
                            provisions of the <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> under reference,
                            the sites will be immediately available and the question of details left
                            to subsequent discussion.</p>

                        <p>The purpose of this meeting was to examine the twelve requests which were
                            presented by the Ambassador of Panama to President Roosevelt about a

                            that this was to be the first of a series of meetings at which the
                            Ambassador and himself might arrive at a satisfactory basis of agreement
                            which would then be submitted for approval to their respective
                            Governments. The Panamanian Ambassador agreed to this procedure.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Welles stated that he was in principle willing to turn over to Panama
                            the waterworks in question so far as they are located on Panamanian
                            soil, provided the following conditions are made: <list>

                                    reached between the Government of Panama and the Canal Zone to
                                    continue the present supply of water from the Canal Zone for use
                                    in Panama and <pb n="443" xml:id="pg_443" facs="0451"/>Colón
                                    subject to payment of reasonable compensation by the Government

                                <label>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)</label>
                                <item>The Panamanian Government will recognize its obligation to
                                    continue to pay to the Canal Zone the interest and amortization
                                    payments as provided in the Treaty of 1903.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>The Panamanian Ambassador appeared to feel that this offer was a
                            satisfactory one. He said, however, that he would like to examine a
                            detailed accounting of the revenues and expenses of these waterworks
                            with a view to finding out whether or not the revenues, which he states
                            have shown considerable increases in recent years, have not been
                            sufficient to take care of the unamortized balances (it will be
                            necessary to look into this question; it is believed that a very careful
                            accounting has been kept and that such excess revenues as have been
                            available over and above operation costs and fixed charges have been
                            expended for different civic improvements in these cities).</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">2. <hi rend="italic">The Colón Lots.</hi></p>
                        <p>Mr. Welles stated that an arrangement could be worked out providing for
                            the transfer of the Colón lots to the Panamanian Government on the basis
                            that the latter would agree to consider such a transaction as full
                            compensation for the fulfilment of the obligation of that Government to
                            make available promptly the necessary defense sites for the adequate
                            defense of the Canal. It was agreed that at the next meeting the
                            Ambassador would be presented with a formula in writing designed to
                            cover this point. The Ambassador said that in as much as the Panamanian
                            Government only recognizes our title to the lots as valid until 1967,
                            the proposed arrangement might be inequitable from the Panamanian point
                            of view if we were to retain the defense sites beyond 1967. Mr. Welles
                            pointed out briefly the fact that the lots are worth many times the
                            value of the defense sites. The Ambassador seemed to feel that in
                            addition to the lots the United States should be willing to undertake
                            the completion of the Panamanian section of the Inter-American Highway
                            to the Costa Rican border.</p>

                        <p>The Ambassador was told that nothing could be done under this heading in
                            the absence of the presentation by him of a specific statement of the
                            complaints of his Government. The Ambassador referred to an order of the
                            United States Military authorities in the Zone in February 1940
                            prohibiting the sale of vegetables by Panamanian merchants to our
                            military establishment.<note n="29" xml:id="d352fn29">For correspondence

                            order was the subject of a protest by the Panamanian Government dated

                            handed to President Roosevelt on the occasion of his visit to Panama. It
                            was agreed that an investigation would be made of this question and that
                            it would be taken up at the next meeting.</p>

                        <p>The Ambassador was told that the President has decided to defer any
                            action on this matter for the present in view of many urgent projects
                            requiring attention. Mr. Welles stated that this was merely a
                            postponement since there is agreement in principle that this work should
                            be done. Meanwhile, it is hoped to improve the ferry facilities.</p>

                        <p>The wording of this point in the original Panamanian memorandum is
                            obscure; the above represents the Ambassador’s idea of what it means.
                            The War Department is to be consulted regarding the desirability of
                            allowing the Panamanians to use the access roads which are to be built
                            to the different defense sites.</p>

                            Rican or other labor satisfactory to the Panamanian Government. Mr.
                            Welles desires to be furnished with a full statement of the present
                            position so that he may take this up with General Marshall<note n="30"

                        <p>Mr. Welles stated that in principle he was most anxious to accede to the
                            desire of the Panamanian Government and to make available at a
                            reasonable price (the Panamanians’ suggestion is one cent per kilowatt)
                            such excess current as may be available. However, the question is one of
                            fact as to whether there is any excess. This is to be checked with the
                            Canal authorities.</p>

                            made in the administrative procedure for the construction of this
                            highway, but that it would be desirable for the United States Government
                            to consider the possibility of extending the road from Rio Hato north to
                            the Costa Rican border. He said that this extension would be highly
                            desirable from the point of view of the defense of the Canal and of
                            providing adequate food supplies to the Zone. Mr. Welles told him that

                            informed the appropriate Panamanian authorities that, in accordance with
                            the Treaty of 1936 between the two countries, which recognizes their
                            joint and vital interest in the effective protection of the Canal, the
                            Government of the United States desired to reach an agreement with the
                            Republic of Panama for the utilization for the defense of the Canal of a

                            between Panama and the United States with respect to which suggestions
                            as to positive action by the United States were made. These points have
                            been discussed with the Ambassador by the Under Secretary of State and

                            Memorandum which the Honorable Mr. Sumner Welles, Under Secretary of
                            State, presented to the Ambassador of Panama and which concerns three of
                            the twelve points contained in the Memorandum which under date of
                            February 18, 1941, was presented by the Ambassador of Panama to His
                            Excellency the President of the United States, describing the immediate
                            aspirations of Panama, which he submitted to the United States
                            Government for its kind consideration for the purpose of obtaining from
                            the said Government certain partial compensations for the vital
                            concessions which Panama has granted for the defense of the Panama
                            Canal.</p>
                        <p>The Panamanian Government feels gratified by the spirit of cooperation
                            manifested by the United States in the above-mentioned Memorandum and
                            believes that this signifies a step forward on the road to an equitable
                            settlement of the pending points which involve the minimum aspirations
                            of Panama, by no means exaggerated, if they are studied in the light of
                            other negotiations of the same kind.</p>
                        <p>The Government of Panama, being animated by the most earnest desire to
                            cooperate with the Government of the United States in the defense of the
                            Canal, and trusting that the latter Government will, in a broad spirit
                            of understanding and justice, attend to the requests presented by the
                            Panamanian Government, as an act of partial compensation and adequate
                            aid in recognition of the vital cooperation rendered by Panama, has
                            already facilitated to the military authorities of the Canal Zone the
                            tenancy of the areas of land which were requested for air bases,
                            electric detectors and searchlights, etc., and considers, therefore,
                            that it is entitled to expect of the United States Government prompt and
                            favorable attention to the Panamanian requests.</p>

                                    Panama would be disposed to pay for the said water at the rate

                                    water used for cleaning and for fire fighting). All this in the
                                    manner in which it is now furnished for the National Aqueduct of
                                    Las Sabanas. Panama undertakes to maintain the existing sanitary
                                    conditions in the operation of the said aqueducts and

                            The usual complimentary references to our respective countries and
                            peoples were made, together with a brief history of our efforts here to
                            be cooperative with Panama, including the new treaty that was recently
                            negotiated.</p>

                            Japan and Italy from 1933 on, which I said pointed unerringly to
                            movements of conquest on their part; that during these years this
                            Government proclaimed and practiced all of the principles of world order
                            under law, including justice, peaceful procedures, adherence to high
                            moral concepts, reciprocal fair dealing and fair play. I said that I
                            pled with each of these countries to change their policies, which were
                            leading straight toward war and conquest, leaving nothing unsaid or
                            undone in a most persistent effort to prevail on them to refrain from
                            plunging the world into a state of lawlessness and more or less
                            barbarism; that it proved absolutely impossible, and I have a profound
                            conviction that Hitler plans to dominate this hemisphere, politically
                            and economically, if he succeeds in getting control of the high seas by
                            conquering Great Britain. I elaborated on the usual arguments I have
                            made in the past on the state of actual and imminent danger from such
                            domination by Hitler that confronts this hemisphere and each of the
                            nations in it.</p>
                        <p>I then returned to a few additional brief references to Panama and our
                            relations with that country. The Minister said that he and his
                            Government proposed to observe the good neighbor policy and the spirit
                            of cooperation underlying it, and that in order to maintain
                            understanding and bring about a friendly settlement of any differences,
                            the Minister felt that he should make this trip to Washington to enable
                            him to discuss these matters in person. I replied that I was pleased,
                            but not surprised to see this fine example of cooperation on the part of
                            the Foreign Minister, and that my Government would reciprocate the fine
                            spirit which he had shown. I assured him that my associates would meet
                            him and his Government in a spirit of mutual concession and would
                            endeavor, in the friendliest manner, to work out a settlement of the
                            matters being discussed between our two countries. He insisted that he
                            would meet us halfway.</p>

                            Arias, commenting pessimistically on the negotiations in Washington and
                            expressing the hope that President Roosevelt would “intervene” in order
                            that they might result successfully. Text by subsequent telegram.<note

                        <p>Supplementing the memorandum which the Embassy of Panama presented to the
                            Department of State under date of May 20 last, in which it once more
                            repeated to the Government of the United States the desire of the
                            Government of Panama that due attention should be given and a
                            satisfactory reception accorded the petitions formulated in the

                            of personally delivering to His Excellency the President of the United

                            the statements made by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic
                            of Panama to the Under Secretary of State, Mr. Sumner Welles, in the
                            conversations which took place between these high officials recently and
                            which clarify and indicate the scope of Panamanian aspirations, the said
                            petitions are reiterated as follows:<note n="39" xml:id="d358fn39"
                                >Points 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 12 omitted since they are the same as

                        <p>1) The aqueduct and sewers of the cities of Panama and Colón, as well as
                            the works and services of sanitation and garbage collection in the said
                            cities, shall pass into the possession of the Panamanian Government in
                            their entirety, and the Republic shall not have to pay the United States
                            any amount for the cost of the installations effected nor for the
                            services mentioned. Until the Republic is in a position properly to
                            provide for the water supply of the cities of Panama and Colón, the
                            Canal Zone shall furnish the necessary water to the said cities in the
                            limits between the two jurisdictions at a cost of not more than 9
                            hundredths balboa per thousand gallons (including escapes, wastes, or
                            water used for cleaning and for fire fighting). All this in the manner
                            in which it is now furnished for the National Aqueduct at Las Sabanas.
                            Panama undertakes to maintain the existing sanitary conditions in the
                            operation of the said aqueducts and sewers.</p>

                            of the United States will construct a bridge or tunnel, for public use,
                            which will permanently and adequately connect the capital of the Isthmus
                            with the central provinces across the Canal. Meanwhile, large ferries
                            shall be placed in operation for crossing the canal, on uninterrupted
                            service, day and night.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>9) The Government of Panama considers that the Government of the United
                            States ought to cover in full the cost of the highway to Rio Hato as
                            compensation, if only in part, for the use which it has been making of
                            the lands situated in the jurisdiction of Rio Hato, without the consent
                            or authorization of the Panamanian Government, and hopes that it will
                            reimburse Panama for the sums which it has spent in the building of the
                            said highway. The Republic of Panama would be particularly pleased if,
                            among the highways essential to the defense of the Canal which are to be
                            constructed at the expense of the United States, there should be
                            included the continuation of the Rio Hato highway to the border with
                            Costa Rica. The highway marked P–8, which will run from Las Sabanas to
                            connect with the transisthmian highway at the Madden Dam (Represa de
                            Alhajuela), will be constructed of concrete, with two lanes and equal in
                            width to the transisthmian highway and will have the same specifications
                            as the highway which runs from Chorrera to Rio Hato.</p>
                        <p>10) The Government of Panama sees with satisfaction the promise made by
                            the United States Government to change the railroad station of the city
                            of Panamá, so as to facilitate the plans for urban improvement. It
                            considers it advisable, however, that the Government of the United
                            States undertake to change the said station to a spot within the Canal
                            Zone, or under Panamanian jurisdiction, as the Republic of Panama may
                            decide at the time. When the change of the railroad station is made, the
                            present station, the patio used now by the Railroad Company, and the
                            various buildings adjacent to the said patio and belonging to the said
                            Company will pass to the possession of the Government of Panama.</p>
                        <p>11) In the event that transit is interrupted on the highways of the
                            Republic for more than two consecutive hours, on account of the
                            transportation of war matériel or troops of the United States, in time
                            of peace, an adequate indemnity shall be allowed to Panama, determined
                            by common agreement between the two countries, as compensation for the
                            damages caused the national economy of Panama and caused to private

                        <p>The Government of the Republic of Panama, once more giving proof of its
                            good friendship for the people of the United States and of sincere
                            cooperation in the solution of the problems which affect both countries,
                            has already given the military authorities of the Panama Canal
                            possession of the lands recently requested for the better defense of the
                            Canal in the present international conflagration. That fact and the
                            assurances given by the Under Secretary of State to the Ambassador of
                            Panama in Washington concerning the good disposition with which the
                            Government of the United States would receive the Panamanian petitions
                            as soon as Panama heeded the request made with respect to the defense
                            sites seem to justify the confidence which the Government of Panama
                            feels that these petitions will be favorably settled in their entirety,
                            thus making possible a better understanding in the agreements concerning
                            the leasing of such areas of land, so closely connected with the said

                        <p>On February 18, 1941 the Ambassador of Panama left with the President of
                            the United States a memorandum listing twelve points in the relations
                            between Panama and the United States with respect to which positive
                            action by the United States was requested. On May 20 and June 23, 1941,
                            respectively, supplemental memoranda on the same points were left with
                            the Department.</p>
                        <p>These points and the observations with regard to them have been carefully
                            and sympathetically considered by the Under Secretary of State of the

                            Panamanian Minister of Foreign Relations and with the Ambassador of
                            Panama in Washington.</p>

                            meets with the approval of the Government of Panama, it is proposed that
                            a formal exchange of notes in regard thereto take place simultaneously
                            with the reaching of an agreement by the two Governments on the terms of

                            he permit me to consult with you and see if you had any objection. After

                        <p>211. For Bonsal. Reference our telephone conversation this morning. I
                            delivered the message to the Minister of Foreign Affairs and <pb n="463"
                                xml:id="pg_463" facs="0471"/>we had a discussion of 2 hours, the
                            gist of which is as follows: He requests the Acting Secretary to
                            reconsider the matter and withdraw objection to the publication of the
                            statement. He points out that Panama has already complied with a large
                            part of her obligations by delivering the defense sites, that public
                            opinion here is anxious to know what Panama is to get in return, and
                            that continued delay in making known the nature of the United States
                            reply to the Panamanian requests, particularly since it is known that
                            the Cabinet met on July 31 to consider our reply, would have an
                            unfortunate effect on public opinion. He said that the statement would
                            make it clear that there had been no final agreement, and that our reply
                            was contingent upon the conclusion of a contract.</p>
                        <p>I asked why the Panamanian Government could not reply in the next few
                            days to our proposal for the contract thus making it possible to issue a
                            statement covering the complete negotiation. He said that the
                            preparation of their reply would take several days and he regarded it as
                            urgent to inform opinion here of what Panama was to receive in return
                            for advance compliance with her part of the proposed contract.</p>
                        <p>I inquired if he could give me any idea of what his Government has in
                            mind as rental for private lands, indicating that I could not conceive
                            that Panama would seriously ask more than a fair current price. He said
                            this point had not yet been determined.</p>
                        <p>I agreed to submit to the Department his request for reconsideration.
                            Please cable reply.</p>

                        <p>168. Your 211, August 2, 5 p.m. Kindly make known to the Minister of
                            Foreign Affairs the following views: that the Department, <pb n="464"
                                xml:id="pg_464" facs="0472"/>although appreciative of the reasons
                            prompting the desire of the Panamanian Government to issue a statement,
                            is unable to agree that its memorandum be made public because such
                            action would convey a partial and therefore erroneous impression of the
                            current negotiations; that at the urgent request of the Foreign Minister
                            during his visit to the United States the Department although working
                            under great pressure took special pains to advance the negotiations
                            which culminated in the presentation of the memorandum on the 12 points;
                            that despite this Government’s interest, repeatedly manifested, in an
                            early conclusion of the long drawn out negotiations over sites, the
                            Panamanian Government has not advanced the matter since the discussions
                            in Washington; and that if the reply of the Government of Panama to the
                            questions of interest to us is satisfactory, then the two Governments
                            could proceed to make a full statement covering all the principal
                            aspects of the negotiations. Any other procedure whereby only one side
                            of the negotiations is made public would inevitably lead to public
                            misunderstanding.</p>
                        <p>In conveying the foregoing message, kindly make it clear that the
                            Department fully understands the desire of the Panamanian Government to
                            inform the people of Panama of the progress of the negotiations and is
                            prepared to make known the details of the pending arrangements as soon
                            as there is agreement on all important points. If, pending conclusion of
                            the present discussions, the Government of Panama feels it necessary to
                            make some statement it is suggested that it be general in scope
                            indicating that satisfactory progress is being made to arrive at a
                            solution on questions of interest to both countries and that it is hoped
                            that the negotiations will be brought to a prompt conclusion.</p>

                        <p>Reference is made to the memorandum which the Ambassador of Panama handed
                            to Mr. Welles on August 21, 1941 as the official statement of the
                            Panamanian Government on the changes which Panamanian officials would
                            like to see made in the Department’s memorandum of July 8, 1941
                            concerning the action which the Government of the United States is
                            willing to take, subject to certain limitations, on each of the twelve
                            points in the relations between the two Governments with respect to
                            which positive action by the United States was requested.</p>
                        <p>This Government is pleased to accept those modifications of points 7
                            (Desire of the Panamanian Government that our military and Zone police
                            be armed only with billies while in the territory of Panama) and 12 (The
                            desire of the Panamanian Government for three gasoline or oil tanks at
                            Balboa) which are suggested in the Ambassador’s memorandum. The proposal
                            to use the phrase “Canal Zone–city of Colón” near the beginning of the
                            second paragraph of point 2 (Railroad Lots in Panamá and Colón) is
                            similarly acceptable.</p>
                        <p>Point 5 (Jurisdiction over roads and highways in Panamanian territory) it
                            is felt should be modified to conform with those stipulations concerning
                            jurisdiction which the two Governments will adopt in the lease agreement
                            currently under negotiation.</p>
                        <p>In order to clarify this Government’s statement regarding point 1 (The
                            waterworks at Colón and Panamá) of the Department’s memorandum of July
                            8, 1941, it should be pointed out that the turning over to the
                            Government of the Republic of Panama of the physical <pb n="467"
                                xml:id="pg_467" facs="0475"/>properties of the water works and
                            sewerage systems and the administration thereof, including the
                            collection of the water rates does not in any way modify the existing
                            arrangement for the responsibility of the public health services of the
                            cities of Panamá and Colón as specified in the second paragraph of
                            Article VII of the Convention between the United States of America and
                            Panama, signed at Washington November 18, 1903. Thus the Republic of
                            Panama will continue to pay only those costs of sanitary measures for
                            which it has been responsible in the past.</p>
                        <p>This Government in continuing to maintain the health services in the
                            cities of Panamá and Colón is confident that the Government of the
                            Republic of Panama will fully cooperate with the appropriate Canal Zone
                            officials in carrying out the agreement regarding increased
                            participation of Panamanian personnel in sanitation activities in those
                            cities as set forth in the exchange of notes accompanying the General
                            Treaty of March 2, 1936, which in turn refer to the earlier proposal of

                        <p>539. Reference my letter to the Under Secretary of December 4<note n="44"
                                xml:id="d367fn44">Not printed.</note> reporting conversation with
                            the Minister for Foreign Affairs regarding the 12 points. Yesterday
                            afternoon the Minister said to me the following: The President is
                            greatly concerned over the delay in completing the negotiations on the
                            12 points and the lease contract and feels his Government is being
                            criticized here because of the delay. He had hoped to make progress
                            before this but the illness of the Panamanian Ambassador at Washington
                            has prevented it. He appreciates that it was agreed that negotiations on
                            the 12 points would take place in Washington but in view of the
                            Ambassador’s illness the President now asks that I transmit to the State
                            Department the following request: That the United States Government
                            agrees now that simultaneously with reaching agreement on the lease
                            contract the United States Government will by executive action, without
                            necessity of awaiting action by Congress, turn the railroad lots over to
                            Panama and liquidate the credit for the Rio Hato Highway.</p>

                        <p>401. Your 539, December 24, 10 a.m. As the Minister of Foreign Affairs
                            has informed you, the Panamanian Ambassador here, because of illness has
                            been unable to receive the Department’s reply on the 12 points. The
                            Under Secretary was ready to hand the reply to him several weeks
                            ago.</p>
                        <p>Careful and sympathetic consideration has been given the concern of the
                            Panamanian Government over the possible delay in completing negotiations
                            on certain of the 12 points. However, it is believed that under present
                            conditions Congressional action may be far more expeditiously obtained
                            than would formerly have been the case. You are requested to inform the
                            appropriate Panamanian officials that the Department is proceeding at
                            once to draft the proposed legislation on the three major Panamanian
                            requests and to express the Department’s hope that the Panamanian
                            Government will shortly state its willingness to accede to the
                            arrangements which have been proposed by this Government in connection
                            with the defense sites.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that the <hi
                                rend="italic">Star &amp; Herald</hi> of November 19 carried a news
                            item referring to an order from the Chief of Internal Revenue of Panamá
                            to collect national taxes from employees of private enterprises
                            established in the Canal Zone and commenting that the decision to
                            collect such taxes is based on the administration’s thesis that the
                            Republic maintains fiscal sovereignty over the entire territory of the
                            Canal Zone.</p>
                        <p>Upon investigating the origin of this news item, the Embassy ascertained
                            that the Panamanian General Administration of Internal Revenue has for
                            some time been trying to have the West India Oil Company, S. A., pay the
                            “Fondo Obrero” tax (See Despatch No. 708 dated April 10, 1939<note
                                n="45" xml:id="d369fn45">Not printed.</note>) for the employees of
                            their branch operating in the Canal Zone, as well as that being paid for
                            all their other <pb n="469" xml:id="pg_469" facs="0477"/>employees in
                            Panamá. On November 13 President Arnulfo Arias upheld in its entirety
                            the decision of the Secretary of the Treasury, Resolution No. 251, dated
                            August 30, 1940, that the West India Oil Company, S. A., branch in the
                            Zone is not an auxiliary work of The Panama Canal or of the Panama
                            Railroad, and that the employees thereof, even when they reside in the
                            Zone, are therefore not exempted from taxation by Article III of the
                            treaty of 1936;<note n="46" xml:id="d369fn46">General treaty of

                            functioning of the Canal, neither the branch nor its employees were
                            subject to Panamanian taxation under Article III, Section 5, of the
                            general treaty of March 2, 1936, and under Article X of the treaty of

                        <p>So soon as the decision of President Arias was announced, the
                            Sub-secretary of Government and Justice wrote to the Administrator of
                            Internal Revenue, instructing them to demand from all private
                            enterprises established in the Zone “the payment of national taxes which
                            may be applicable in each particular case, in accordance with the thesis
                            sustained by the Government that the Republic retains its fiscal
                            sovereignty in all the territory of the Canal Zone.” To complete the
                            Department’s file, a copy of the Spanish text, obtained informally by
                            the Embassy, and a translation of this letter, No. 691, dated November
                            13, 1940, are enclosed.<note n="47" xml:id="d369fn1">Not printed.</note>
                            This letter indicates that it is the intention of Panamá to levy all
                            taxes, not only the “Fondo Obrero”, on private firms established and
                            operating in the Zone.</p>
                        <pb n="470" xml:id="pg_470" facs="0478"/>
                        <p>In the past few days the Embassy, as well as the Executive Secretary of
                            The Panama Canal, has received requests for advice from numerous firms
                            established in the Canal Zone as to what stand they should take towards
                            the letters they have received from the Panamanian Internal Revenue
                            authorities requesting a complete list of all their employees and their
                            salaries. In discussing this matter with officials of The Panama Canal,
                            it has been felt that since it involves the question of treaty rights it
                            would be better, before communicating in any way with the Panamanian
                            authorities, to submit the matter to the Department for instructions.
                            Thus far the Embassy and the Executive Secretary have limited themselves
                            to suggesting to inquirers that the replies to the letters from the
                            Internal Revenue officials of the Government of Panama be confined to a
                            simple acknowledgment with a statement that the matter is being brought
                            to the attention of The Panama Canal under whose regulations the
                            particular concern is established and operates within the Canal
                            Zone.</p>
                        <p>In submitting this matter to the Department, I should like to call
                            attention to the complications arising out of the varied set-ups of the
                            different firms operating in the Zone. The West India Oil Company, S.
                            A., for instance, is organized under the laws of Panamá, with head
                            office in Panama City, maintaining in the Zone only branches directly
                            subordinate to this Panamá corporation. The branches of the National
                            City and Chase National Banks operating in the Zone are technically
                            separate from those in Panamá and are directed from the head offices in
                            New York, although in most instances the managers of the branches
                            established in Panamá City and in Colón are also managers of the
                            branches established in the Zone. Most of the shipping companies have
                            branches both in the Zone and in Panamá, with interchangeable personnel,
                            although a few have offices in the Zone only. Both the Standard Fruit
                            and United Fruit enterprises have their offices in the Zone, and, in the
                            case of the Standard Fruit Company, the manager thereof has informed the
                            Embassy that they carry on no operations, either directly or indirectly
                            in Panamanian territory, limiting their activities on the Isthmus to
                            shipping and to purchasing bananas delivered to them in Cristóbal, upon
                            which the Panamanian export tax has been paid. The Ford Company in
                            Cristóbal conducts a great deal of business in Panamá and most of its
                            employees are Panamanians living in Panamá. Consideration of this tax
                            question is further complicated as it involves Panamanians and
                            non-Panamanians, some of whom reside in the Zone, and many, nationals
                            and otherwise, living in Panamá.</p>
                        <p>I should like to mention further in this connection that these firms
                            operating within the Zone are not subject to taxation by the United <pb
                                n="471" xml:id="pg_471" facs="0479"/>States, except the nominal
                            license fee exacted by The Panama Canal; that some of their employees
                            reside within the Zone, but that the majority, although no exact data
                            are available thereon, probably live in Panamá; that the employees of
                            these private enterprises, as distinct from the gold employees of The
                            Panama Canal and workers within Panamanian territory, are not covered by
                            any retirement or benefit fund. Since a good proportion of them are
                            Panamanian citizens and living within Panamanian territory, it probably
                            would be advantageous to the workers themselves to make them eligible to
                            the benefits of the “Fondo Obrero”.</p>
                        <p>It is feared, however, that the Panamanian authorities have picked out
                            the “Fondo Obrero” as the most plausible wedge for eventually
                            establishing its contention of having fiscal sovereignty in the Zone,
                            and that, if it is able to maintain the position in regard to the “Fondo
                            Obrero”, it might lead to attempts to make private firms in the Zone
                            subject to all Panamanian taxes.</p>

                            dated November 13, 1940 issued by the Panamanian Government (Secretaría
                            de Hacienda y Tesoro) sustaining Executive Resolution No. 251 dated
                            August 30, 1940 with relation to taxation by the Republic of Panama of
                            private business enterprises established in the Canal Zone, and invite
                            consideration of the assertion contained in the latter resolution that
                            “the Republic maintains fiscal jurisdiction in all the territory of the
                            Canal Zone”.</p>
                        <p>I need not say that this Government will desire urgently to bring to the
                            attention of the Government of the Republic of Panama any specific
                            instances in which attempts are made to impose taxation on private
                            enterprises established in the Canal Zone which are exempted from such
                            taxation by reason of the treaty commitments between our two countries,
                            but I desire now in a general way to invite the attention of the
                            Panamanian Government to the provisions of Article III of the Convention
                            between the United States of America and the Republic of Panama signed

                            with the authorities of the United States Army and Navy concerning the
                            acquisition of arms and war matériel by the Government of Paraguay and
                            to sign any lists of requests for this matériel. I have also noted that

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Orme Wilson</hi>: The Minister of Paraguay came
                            to see me this morning, accompanied by his two officers. I had a very
                            satisfactory talk with them, particularly with regard to general
                            inter-American policy and with regard to the policy of the United States
                            vis-à-vis <pb n="474" xml:id="pg_474" facs="0482"/>the Axis powers. I
                            was gratified to have categorical statements made to me by the two
                            officers that the Paraguayan Army is 100 percent in accord with the
                            United States in its determination to prevent any German aggression
                            against the Western Hemisphere and that there was no pro-German
                            sentiment of any kind within the Paraguayan Army. I was further informed
                            by the officers that, while there was a certain amount of Axis
                            propaganda going on among civilian elements of Paraguay, the Army was
                            determined to stop this and had already taken some effective measures in
                            that sense. (I wish you would draft some letter for me to send to Wesley
                                Frost<note n="4" xml:id="d372fn4">American Minister in
                                Paraguay.</note> communicating this to him.)</p>
                        <p>In brief, I think that you should insist that the War Department expedite
                            immediately a satisfactory arrangement with the Paraguayans covering
                            their requests along the general lines of the memorandum attached.<note
                                n="5" xml:id="d372fn5"><hi rend="italic">Infra.</hi></note> It is of
                            course imperative that the Paraguayan officers and the War Department
                            first agree upon the list of matériel and the time schedule for
                            deliveries before the Lend-Lease people can take up the question of
                            compensation. When this latter stage is reached I wish you would
                            personally see that the most elastic provisions possible be included
                            with regard to compensation. I said this morning that anything like a
                            99-year period was of course impossible for us to accept but that we
                            wished to recognize their present economic situation to the fullest
                            extent in any arrangement that might be made. As a practical question,
                            it would seem to me that compensation could be agreed upon on the basis
                            of the delivery to us over a period of years of quebracho in bulk or in
                            extract and, barely possibly, canned meat for defense needs. Naturally
                            all these questions will have to be investigated in the fullest detail
                            but I think that general line would be the only one which would be
                            practical, since I know you are well aware of the financial and economic
                            situation of Paraguay. Please keep me informed every few days of the
                            progress which is being made in this matter.</p>

                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>The aforementioned law of 1941 places in the hands of the
                                President of the United States the faculty of determining these
                                conditions (Section 3<hi rend="italic">b</hi>). As we know the
                                equitable attitude of President Roosevelt and his proven good will
                                towards our country, we should not be surprised to find in this
                                basic agreement, especially that part relating to acquisition of
                                munitions, periods for payment amounting to as much as 99 years and
                                the consideration of moral rather than material benefits such as the
                                indirect benefit arising from the Paraguayan decision to accompany
                                the United States from the very first moment when the defense of the

                        <p>53. The Department this morning handed to the Paraguayan Minister a draft
                            of basic agreement for the lend-lease program of transferring military
                            matériel to Paraguay. The principal financial provisions are as follows:
                            Paraguay is to receive a total of $11,000,000 of war and navy matériel
                            of which it is expected $2,000,000 of army matériel and $1,000,000 of
                            navy matériel will be transferred during the fiscal year ending June 30,
                            1942. This delivery date is subject to change if broad defense
                            considerations so require.</p>
                        <pb n="476" xml:id="pg_476" facs="0484"/>
                        <p>With respect to repayment, Paraguay is expected to pay $50,000 in each
                            fiscal year until 1947, making a total of $300,000 to be repaid prior to
                            June 30, 1947. In consideration of the broad objectives of the program
                            and of certain very general economic concepts, the entire obligation of
                            Paraguay to the United States would be considered discharged by such
                            payments.</p>
                        <p>For your strictly confidential information, the terms being offered
                            Paraguay are the most favorable being offered any of the American
                            republics. The amount of matériel to be delivered is relatively large
                            compared to the amounts to be delivered to other nations, and the
                            repayment specified is very low.</p>
                        <p>The Department hopes to transmit to you information regarding the
                            progress of Export-Import Bank arrangements in the very near future.</p>

                        <p>114. Department’s No. 53, July 7, 8 p.m. I learned last night that a
                            clause in the arms contract is interpreted by Argaña<note n="7"
                                xml:id="d375fn7">Luis Argaña, Paraguayan Minister for Foreign
                                Affairs.</note> in Cabinet meetings here to mean that the United
                            States in addition to $300,000 can claim from Paraguay $2,700,000 worth
                            of local products usable in war effort at specially low prices. If such
                            a clause exists I would have preferred that the Department mention it in
                            telegram 53; and now may perhaps still be able to use clarification if
                            the Department furnishes it.</p>

                        <p>70. Your 114, July 26, noon. There is no clause in the draft of the basic
                            lend-lease agreement handed to the Paraguayan Minister on July 7 which
                            would enable the United States to demand in payment from Paraguay the
                            local products to which you refer. The <pb n="477" xml:id="pg_477"
                                facs="0485"/>amount of $300,000 in cash spread over 6 years is the
                            only payment expected of Paraguay for a total obligation of $11,000,000.
                            For your confidential information these terms are by far the most
                            generous accorded to any of the American republics. Most of the
                            republics are requested to repay between 30 and 60 percent.</p>
                        <p>It is possible that the Paraguayan authorities are misconstruing article
                            II of the first draft which has been transmitted to you. This article is
                            purely a reciprocal undertaking and does in no way commit Paraguay to
                            such payments as you mention. We have handed the Paraguayan Minister and
                            the other diplomatic representatives in Washington revised drafts which
                            vary only with respect to the preamble and protocol. Copies of these are
                            being placed in today’s airmail.</p>
                        <p>With reference to your statement that you suspect that the Foreign
                            Minister is not really pleased by the arms arrangement, it is the
                            Department’s strong conviction that the terms afforded Paraguay are the
                            most generous terms which could possibly be conceived for any type of a
                            financial transaction.</p>
                        <p>With respect to delivery of the goods, it is of course true that our
                            defense requirements are pressing to the utmost degree upon our
                            productive capacity. Nevertheless, our statement that the United States
                            expects to deliver to Paraguay $2,000,000 of equipment during the period
                            ending June 30, 1942 is a firm statement of our present program and must
                            of course be accepted as such.</p>
                        <p>Aguilera has already left for Paraguay.</p>

                        <p>75. You will please request an interview with the President of Paraguay
                            in order to discuss with him the willingness of this Government to make
                            available military and naval matériel under the provisions of the Lend
                            Lease act and to send a military mission to Paraguay to give instruction
                            in the use of this equipment. Please inform the President that these
                            offers of this Government were made because of this Government’s very
                            friendly relations with Paraguay whose government and army have
                            consistently supported the policy first enunciated by the late General
                                Estigarribia<note n="8" xml:id="d377fn8">President of Paraguay,
                                1939–40.</note> to cooperate with the United States in case of
                            necessity for the defense of the Western Hemisphere, but never for
                            purposes of aggression. It is perfectly <pb n="478" xml:id="pg_478"
                                facs="0486"/>obvious that economic considerations have had no part
                            in the determination of the policy of this Government.</p>
                        <p>As long as Paraguay maintains these views the Government of the United
                            States will be disposed to give consideration to such modifications and
                            suggestions affecting the draft of the basic agreement handed to
                            Minister Soler as the Paraguayan Government may deem advisable to
                            propose.</p>

                        <p>76. The Minister of Paraguay in Washington believes that action on the
                            basic agreement covering the transfer of war matériel under the
                            provisions of the Lend Lease act would be greatly expedited were the
                            President of Paraguay clearly to state his wishes to the Minister of
                            Foreign Affairs. The views which you were instructed to present in the
                            Department’s telegram no. 75 of August 13, 6 p.m. have been approved by
                            the Minister of Paraguay here who has expressed the intention to follow
                            a similar line in his direct and personal communications to the
                            President.</p>
                        <p>The Paraguayan Minister also suggested that you inform the President that
                            the payment of $300,000, by which the Paraguayan Government would
                            discharge completely its obligations to pay for the matériel covered by
                            the basic agreement could be discharged either in cash or in articles of
                            defense at the choice of the Paraguayan Government. He was informed that
                            the Department has made careful studies which have revealed the
                            impracticability of receiving payments in commodities and in view of
                            this the payments in cash, stipulated in the basic agreement have been
                            reduced to such amounts as, in the opinion of the economic experts of
                            this Government, would occasion no difficulty to Paraguay. If the
                            President or Paraguayan officials should refer to this matter, you will
                            please express to them this Government’s views as set forth above.</p>

                            protracted Cabinet session Argaña this noon received me to inform <pb
                                n="479" xml:id="pg_479" facs="0487"/>me that the assurances from
                            Washington regarding article 6 of the basic arms contract are accepted
                            as satisfactory by the Paraguayan Government and that Dr. Soler is
                            accordingly being authorized today by telegraph to sign contract <hi

                            Government here and if it is approved Soler will be furnished full

                            deferred as a later recourse. Military Attaché Van Natta is of the
                            opinion that the sending of American missions is not likely to cause
                            difficulties.</p>

                            months’ period up to July 1, 1942 an approximate total value of
                            $2,000,000 for use by the Paraguayan Army, and an approximate total
                            value of $1,000,000 for use by the Paraguayan Navy. The payment schedule
                            in the agreement provides for remittances by Paraguay of $50,000 per
                            annum for six years, the total payments of $300,000 amounting to less
                            than 3 percent of the $11,000,000 in armaments and munitions. These are
                            the most generous terms being given to any of the American

                        <p>155. For Under Secretary. Foreign Minister after Cabinet conference
                            formally requests views of American Government as to publication of arms
                            contract. His Government would be glad to publish entire text, and
                            believes this would create favorable impression here. If this is not
                            desired by American Government he suggests partial publication and
                            requests information as to which clauses should be omitted. If the
                            publication of a résumé is preferred he desires an indication as to its
                            terms. A telegraphic reply would be appreciated by Paraguayan
                                Government.<note n="11" xml:id="d383fn11">Instruction No. 80,
                                October 27, 1941, to the Minister in Paraguay stated that the
                                agreement should not be made public (834.24/105a).</note></p>

                        <p>Thus far, there has been no publication even of the news of the
                            signature, although the latter has become known from American radio
                            broadcasts. Argaña has met inquiries from newspapermen by stating that
                            the matter is “reservado”.</p>
                        <p>Argaña definitely feels that full publication is desirable, and as he is
                            in a position to judge its effects I am inclined to accept his view.</p>

                        <p>Such a program would give the Paraguayan Government a modest amount of
                            additional credits, and would provide for the immediate departure to
                            Asunción of two agricultural experts plus the Export-Import Bank’s
                            engineer. With respect to the Paraguayan Minister’s informal suggestion
                            that the mineral resources be studied, I am informed by Mr. Charles Will
                                Wright<note n="20" xml:id="d384fn20">Member of the United States

                            Argentina. I am informed that the concern of Herbert Hoover, Jr.,<note

                            with you February 25 by the Paraguayan Minister is noted with
                            interest.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Pierson and I had a very pleasant visit with the Minister February
                            24, at which time he requested:</p>
                        <p>(1) An additional line of credit to the Banco de la República of
                            $500,000.</p>
                        <p>June 1, 1939, we approved a line of credit to the Banco de la República
                            of $500,000, to enable that institution to meet dollar exchange
                            requirements during periods between export seasons. The Banco has drawn
                            $200,000 of this amount and repaid $66,666.66, leaving a balance unused
                            of the established credit to the Banco of $366,666.66.</p>
                        <p>We stated to the Minister that when this was exhausted we would give
                            consideration to any additional requirements that the Banco might
                            need.</p>
                        <p>(2) The Minister requested additional funds for road building.</p>
                        <p>June 1, 1939, we authorized a loan of $3,000,000 to the Republic of
                            Paraguay for the construction of a highway between Asunción and
                                Villarrica.<note n="24" xml:id="d385fn24">See <ref

                                    758</ref> ff.</note> $1,285,000 of this credit has been used,
                            leaving a balance yet to be expended in the construction of this highway
                            of $1,715,000. This amount will supply a good deal of dollar exchange
                            for Paraguay.</p>
                        <pb n="487" xml:id="pg_487" facs="0495"/>
                        <p>Recent estimates we have received from the contractor, R. W. Hebard &amp;
                            Co., Inc., indicate that the final cost of this highway will approximate
                            $4,000,000. This would require an additional loan of $1,000,000.
                            However, the Export-Import Bank’s engineer strongly recommends that the
                            specifications of the uncompleted portion of the project be modified,
                            which he insists can be done without affecting the usefulness of the
                            road and yet considerably reduce the cost. The modification would be a
                            one lane road instead of two lanes, and since the traffic over this road
                            will not be heavy, a one lane road would be ample. As our own experience
                            in this country proves, another lane can be constructed when needed. In
                            the meantime, the savings from this could be used for lateral or feeder
                            roads.</p>
                        <p>(3) The Minister insisted that we immediately authorize a loan of
                            $3,000,000 to Paraguay to build a complete water and sanitation system
                            for Asunción.</p>
                        <p>We stated to the Minister that we would, if they desire, send an engineer
                            or engineers at the first opportunity to make an estimate of the cost of
                            such a plant. He insisted that we send the engineer with him, which I
                            stated we could not do, but would as soon as convenient.</p>
                        <p>Since Asunción has done without these facilities until now, and because
                            we need our resources for emergency matters, I think this project should
                            await our convenience, although we will send the engineer.</p>
                        <p>(4) The Minister wanted an additional amount of $1,000,000 for feeder
                            roads, and this I have discussed in the latter part of the last
                            paragraph of (2).</p>
                        <p>(5) He wanted $500,000 for river work and port improvements.</p>
                        <p>We are sympathetic with Paraguay, as we are with all South and Central
                            American countries and want to cooperate with them …</p>

                            Export-Import Bank has formally opened a credit of up to $300,000 for
                            agricultural development. Mr. Pierson set forth his views fully when in
                            Asunción and has since received no proposals or suggestions of any kind
                            from the Paraguayan Government nor any indications that Paraguay plans
                            either to accept or reject the offer.</p>
                        <p>With respect to Mr. West’s studies, he has indicated that for some
                            $400,000 it should be possible to build a new dock at Encarnación and
                            repair those at Pilar and Concepción. The Export-Import Bank is prepared
                            to finance these works and will shortly make available details as to how
                            it will carry them out.</p>
                        <p>With regard to a dredge, Mr. West reports that the dredge belonging to
                            the Paraguayan Government was in dry dock undergoing repairs, and that
                            shortly it should be available for service. He states <pb n="489"
                                xml:id="pg_489" facs="0497"/>that none of the hydrographic engineers

                            desirable.</p>
                        <p>The Export-Import Bank has also extended until December 31, 1941 the

                            such assistance for fear of offending Argentina and Brazil.</p>
                        <p>This is of course not in any sense true. Our aid is in no way conditioned
                            on the reactions of the neighboring republics. Moreover, I do not see
                            the justification for the statement that we are withholding economic
                            cooperation from Paraguay. Within the last week you have been informed
                            of three decisions regarding our lend-lease arrangements for
                            transferring military matériel, the financing of port works, and the
                            continued extension of the line of credit to the Banco de la República.
                            At the present time the United States is offering the following
                            assistance: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>

                                    plan was carefully worked out as affording a possible method of
                                    increasing exports and thus producing foreign exchange. The cold
                                    storage plant for domestic consumption goods only would probably
                                    not produce any net foreign exchange, although it may be a
                                    desirable project. In any case it would not be feasible for the
                                    Export-Import Bank to finance the purchase of the equipment in
                                    Argentina. The Bank, however, stands prepared to consider any
                                    reasonable proposals, and I am surprised that none have been
                                    made.</item>

                        <p>Mr. West has reported on other projects, and the Department is studying
                            his recommendations. He points out that Paraguay’s existing dredge has
                            been undergoing complete repairs and that no additional dredge is
                            required. He estimates the cost of installing a waterworks and
                            distribution system, a sewer system, and repaying the street disturbed
                            in laying pipes, at not less than $10,000,000, in contrast to the
                            $3,000,000 mentioned by the Paraguayan Government. He suggests that an
                            inexpensive highway from Concepción to the Brazilian frontier via Pedro
                            Juan Caballero could readily be constructed with the good clay and other
                            materials available in that area. He believes that other roads,
                            especially feeder roads, can more economically be built after further
                            progress has been made on the Villarrica highway, releasing some of the
                            present machinery and equipment.</p>
                        <p>I am sure that you will agree that the financial assistance listed above
                            is of real importance, and that it is desirable to undertake further
                            projects one at a time rather than to announce a large program all at
                            once and then shortly later have much of the favorable reaction
                            dissipated as has apparently and unfortunately been the case with the
                            cooperative work entered into with General Estigarribia. I am certain
                            that you will find it possible to derive the maximum advantage from the
                            several new items of cooperation recently decided upon, and the
                            Department will await with interest your reports of the Paraguayan
                            reaction thereto.</p>
                        <p>With respect to your comment regarding your staff, the Department’s
                            emergency program for increasing the personnel of the missions in the
                            other American republics is progressing rapidly, and your situation
                            should be alleviated.</p>

                                n="30" xml:id="d389fn30">Luis Argaña.</note> on behalf of Minister
                            of Agriculture now states officially Paraguay would be glad to avail
                            herself of $400,000 for mandioca and agricultural development if the
                            American experts can be furnished gratis under Public Resolution No. 29
                                [<hi rend="italic">Public 63</hi>?]<note n="31" xml:id="d389fn31"
                                >Approved May 3, 1939; 53 Stat. (pt. 2) 652.</note> and if an
                            American market for mandioca or mandioca products can be assured. The
                            second condition is to avoid contracting a debt with no security that
                                <pb n="491" xml:id="pg_491" facs="0499"/>means can be found for
                            repaying it. The first is because the salaries and expenses of the two
                            experts would be extremely burdensome under Paraguay’s conditions and
                            standards. An early reply would be appreciated.</p>
                        <p>On behalf of the Minister of Public Works, Minister for Foreign Affairs
                            states that the construction of the port improvements is earnestly
                            desired and that the details shortly to be furnished by the
                            Export-Import Bank will be examined at once upon receipt. It is hoped
                            that action may not be delayed.</p>
                        <p>The municipal head has twice informed me that Aguilera has assured him
                            that the sanitary works for Asunción will soon be granted. This would be
                            helpful and informative and in any case it is desirable that the bank
                            reopen studies and negotiations regarding feeder roads, without which
                            Estigarribia highway will have limited value. There is much criticism
                            among the public here of the highway as unduly expensive in proportion
                            to its usefulness unless feeders can be obtained; and Argaña has been
                            promised funds from Argentina for this purpose. There is now real
                            probability that they will be secured in the very near future on
                            favorable terms; and this would more than neutralize any good effects
                            remaining from our loan, which the Paraguayans are thus far fully
                            repaying, for the main road.</p>
                        <p>Minister of Agriculture has secured disused brewery near the port in
                            which he believes cold storage equipment could be installed for
                            $150,000. This project seems practical and meritorious.</p>
                        <p>The feeder road project in my judgment should have immediate
                            consideration ahead of sanitary projects, although both are highly
                            desirable.</p>

                        <p>62. Your 110, July 19, 6 p.m. The Export-Import Bank has within the last
                            few months set aside $900,000 for additional financial cooperation with
                            Paraguay, the $400,000 for agricultural works and $500,000 for river and
                            port works. The Export-Import Bank has indicated that it is prepared to
                            see any reasonable utilization of this amount.</p>
                        <p>Specifically, the Department and the Export-Import Bank do not feel that
                            we should press Paraguay to carry out a mandioca and <pb n="492"
                                xml:id="pg_492" facs="0500"/>general agricultural program in the
                            face of the apparent Paraguayan reluctance to enter into this work. It
                            would not be feasible for the American experts for a several years
                            program to be furnished free under Public 63 and of course it would not
                            be feasible for an American market for mandioca to be guaranteed.</p>
                        <p>It is suggested that the $900,000 be allocated in the following manner: <list>

                                    using on the central highway. The construction of feeder roads
                                    is largely a matter of local labor expenditure.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>The Export-Import Bank would make arrangements whereby the Hebard Company
                            undertook to work in the additional construction works, both for feeder
                            roads and for port works in its general construction program.</p>
                        <p>With respect to your remarks that the central highway is not being well
                            received, the Export-Import Bank would be glad to receive your
                            suggestions or comments as to other methods of completing the work and
                            of utilizing in the most desirable manner the funds allocated for that
                            purpose.</p>
                        <p>It is the Department’s view that the additional $900,000 of Export-Import
                            Bank credits plus the large unexpended balances of the earlier credits
                            should go a long way towards maintaining the economic situation of
                            Paraguay and towards providing useful works. The Department believes
                            that with these works and with the $11,000,000 arms arrangement, which
                            is on exceedingly generous terms, the Paraguayan Government is receiving
                            the most ample financial cooperation. The Department feels confident
                            that you can use these arrangements in the most effective manner.</p>

                            inter-departmental committee states proposals in Department’s No. 62 in
                            general acceptable, with two requests. First, Minister of Agriculture
                            would like 100,000 additional loan for mandioca development with one
                            American expert. This would bring total program to $1,000,000 which is a
                            respectable round figure to announce. Second, Minister of Finance
                            believes port works and cold storage loans can be financed from harbor
                            dues and warehouse fees but sees no way of financing loans for feed[er]
                            roads. Would it be possible to consider the roads strategic in
                            connection with air bases and arrange under Lend-Lease Act<note n="33"

                        <p>81. Your 130, August 19, 5 p.m. The Department is gratified that the
                            Paraguayan Government finds the loan proposals of the Export-Import Bank
                            acceptable. With respect to the Finance Minister’s first point, the
                            credits totaling $900,000 have been approved by the Bank in two
                            instalments after careful consideration, and the amount cannot be
                            changed without a new consideration by the Bank, which the Department is
                            not now prepared to request. As to the second point, the Lend-Lease Act
                            permits only the transfer of physical <pb n="494" xml:id="pg_494"
                                facs="0502"/>goods essential for defense, and does not permit local
                            expenditures for labor and materials which would be involved in the
                            construction of roads. Local expenditures would be such a preponderant
                            part of the cost of feeder roads that consideration of assistance under
                            Lend-Lease for this purpose is believed impracticable.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that the
                            Paraguayan Minister of Public Works, Captain Ramón Martino, has made
                            inquiries recently both upon myself and Mr. P. Frank Stratton, Manager
                            of R. W. Hebard &amp; Company, respecting the conclusion of definite
                            arrangements with the Export-Import Bank in accordance with the latter’s
                            proposals outlined in the Department’s telegram No. 62 of July 23, 1941,
                            4 p.m. Señor Martino is of the opinion that the river port works can be
                            carried out under the supervision of Mr. A. R. Mesa, the American
                            engineer sent to Asunción by R. W. Hebard &amp; Company for that
                            purpose, without interfering with the continuance of the present highway
                            project. He also expressed himself as feeling that the construction of
                            feeder roads is just now of greater importance than the prompt execution
                            of the port works projects.</p>
                        <p>From a policy standpoint it is desirable that the program of economic
                            cooperation with Paraguay be advanced as rapidly as possible. As has
                            previously been reported, the plans which are now probably about to
                            mature for supplying Paraguay with certain supplies, and for enlarging
                            aviation facilities, are of rather secondary interest to the
                            non-military members of the Cabinet; and the latter will have an
                            influence over hemispheric defense collaboration. Thus while it may be
                            necessary to defer actual work on the improvement of the river ports
                            until next spring or summer it is desirable that the agreements
                            respecting this work, as well as respecting feeder roads and
                            agricultural assistance, be brought to an early conclusion. The
                            Export-Import Bank’s expeditious attention to the matter is respectfully
                            solicited.</p>

                        <p>104. Reference your despatch no. 201 of October 4.<note n="34"
                                xml:id="d396fn34">Not printed.</note> The Department has carefully
                            reconsidered your urging that the Export-Import Bank accede to the
                            request of the Paraguayan Government for an additional $100,000 credit
                            for the mandioca project, and feels that it must maintain its previous
                            position. As you will recall, the Export-Import Bank originally granted
                            a credit of $400,000 for the mandioca and related agricultural projects
                            and later increased the total to $900,000 to include certain port works.
                            The entire $900,000 is now available for such reasonable allocation as
                            the Paraguayan Government may request. A draft proposal has already been
                            prepared and transmitted to the Paraguayan Minister and to you for the
                            allocation of $400,000 for the port works, as an increase in the present
                            Hebard contract. The remaining $500,000 is entirely unallocated. It is
                            suggested that $100,000 of this total be allocated to the mandioca,
                            perhaps $150,000 to the cold storage project and the balance at this
                            time for feeder roads, which will take some time in their construction.
                            If at a subsequent date the projects of construction, especially of
                            feeder roads, are progressing well and the Paraguayan situation appears
                            to require additional credits, the Department would then be prepared to
                            consider taking the matter up again with the Federal Loan Agency. At the
                            present time the Department cannot take up additional credits with the
                            Federal Loan Agency until some progress is made in carrying out works
                            under credits already extended, and until some real need for additional
                            credits is demonstrated.</p>

                            of November 8, 1941,<note n="35" xml:id="d397fn35">Not printed.</note>
                            in which you reported that the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Paraguay
                            informed you that the Paraguayan Government is ready to proceed with the
                            utilization of the credits available from the Export-Import Bank as
                            follows: $400,000 for port works and improvements; $350,000 for branch
                            roads; and $150,000 for a cold storage plant. You also reported in this
                            despatch that you believed the Paraguayan authorities might wish to
                            expend the $350,000 for the construction of branch roads without
                            utilizing the services of a construction or engineering organization
                            from the United States. You indicated, moreover, that an agricultural
                            survey of Paraguay by experts of the United States might reveal
                            important possibilities for the economic development of the country and
                            you mentioned your intention to suggest to the Paraguayan authorities
                            that such a survey be carried out.</p>
                        <p>In connection with the projects which have been suggested for utilization
                            of these credits, there is enclosed a copy of a letter of December 16,
                                1941<note n="35" xml:id="d397fn1">Not printed.</note> from Mr.
                            Warren Lee Pierson, President of the Export-Import Bank, from which it
                            will be observed that he now questions the practicability of the
                            proposed port works and cold storage plant and suggests that the credits
                            might be employed to better advantage if they were utilized entirely in
                            the construction of feeder roads. You are requested to discuss
                            discreetly with the appropriate Paraguayan officials the matter of the
                            allocation of the credits in the light of the considerations advanced by
                            Mr. Pierson and to report your comment and suggestions to the
                            Department.</p>
                        <p>With respect to your comment that the Paraguayan authorities may wish to
                            utilize the $350,000 credit for the construction of branch roads without
                            the assistance of a construction or engineering organization from the
                            United States, the views of Major R. W. Hebard were sought informally by
                            the Department. Major Hebard expressed the view confidentially that he
                            believed the Paraguayans might perform a large part of the construction
                            work on the branch roads, but that he believed the Paraguayans
                            themselves would wish to have the advice and guidance of qualified
                            engineers in carrying out this work.</p>
                        <pb n="497" xml:id="pg_497" facs="0505"/>
                        <p>The President of the Export-Import Bank has likewise expressed the view
                            that utilization by the Paraguayans of the existing organization of the
                            R. W. Hebard Company is the most practicable procedure to follow in
                            undertaking additional highway construction, although he has suggested
                            that if qualified Paraguayan engineers could be found to perform the
                            work they might be given nominal charge of the construction under the
                            general supervision of the company.</p>
                        <p>It is believed that a practicable procedure for construction of the
                            branch roads might be arranged through the presentation to the
                            Export-Import Bank of such suggestions from the Paraguayan authorities
                            as they may wish to make in this respect. If you should be consulted by
                            the Paraguayan authorities concerning the possibility of construction of
                            the roads without a comprehensive contract with a construction or
                            engineering organization from the United States, it would appear
                            advisable for you to suggest discreetly that the Paraguayans embark upon
                            such domestic construction activity gradually enough to assure an
                            entirely satisfactory utilization of the credit. One method of embarking
                            gradually upon such Paraguayan domestic construction activity might be
                            to retain the engineering services and possibly the supervisory
                            functions of highway construction engineers from the United States.</p>
                        <p>With respect to your comment that an extensive agricultural survey of
                            Paraguay by experts from the United States might reveal important
                            possibilities for the economic development of Paraguay, it is believed
                            that it may be advisable at this time to await definite progress in the
                            practical utilization of the credits of $900,000 before exercising
                            initiative which may involve the incurring of further credit obligations
                            by the Paraguayan Government. While agricultural investigation could of
                            course be carried out by experts from the United States without
                            immediate expenditure by the Paraguayan Government for resultant
                            concrete developments, it would appear advisable to avoid giving the
                            impression to the Paraguayan authorities that this Government is urging
                            them to undertake activities or developments which they might not be
                            disposed to undertake on their own initiative.</p>

                        <p>715. For the Under Secretary. My telegram No. 705, December 21, 11 p.m.
                            The Peruvian Government doubtless has decided that some cooperative plan
                            for the defense of the Talara area must be put into effect but for some
                            reason known to itself is delaying action. The Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs told me this morning that after consultation here the Peruvian
                            Ambassador at Washington<note n="7" xml:id="d400fn7">Manuel de Freyre y
                                Santander.</note> received telegraphic instructions to ascertain
                            what additional defense assistance the United States could give Peru at
                            Talara and Callao and a reply now is being awaited. This was the Foreign
                            Minister’s explanation of the delay. When I suggested that he and I see
                            the President<note n="8" xml:id="d400fn8">Manuel Prado y
                                Ugarteche.</note> this afternoon he replied that the President is
                            fully informed and the instructions to the Peruvian Ambassador at
                            Washington represent the President’s decision in the matter.</p>

                        <p>551. Your 705, December 21, 11 p.m. The War and Navy Departments advise
                            that there is “an apparent threat” to the security of the installations
                            of the Talara oil fields and state that it is now a matter of the
                            greatest urgency that a patrol based at Talara be established. Please
                            leave no stone unturned, therefore, to expedite the decision of the
                            Peruvian Government with respect to the request conveyed in the
                            Department’s 540, December 20, noon. For your information and although
                            for military and naval reasons it is not possible to define what is
                            meant by “an apparent threat”, the implications of the phrase are
                            believed to be obvious. The establishment of the patrol at Talara and
                            the protection of the oil fields and installations there are of as vital
                            interest to Peru as to the United States. Please impress upon the
                            Peruvian authorities that they and we are now confronted with a
                            situation in which speedy action is essential from the standpoint of the
                            common interests not only of the two countries but of all the other
                            American republics.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the concern of the Foreign Minister at the prospect of
                            Peru’s taking a stand prior to the Rio conference, you may inform him
                            for his strictly confidential information, if it seems desirable, that
                            other of the American republics have extended to this country exactly
                            the same facilities as those being requested of Peru.</p>

                        <p>558. From the Under Secretary. I am transmitting herewith, in response to
                            the inquiry made of you by the Peruvian Government, specific plans
                            advanced by the War and Navy Departments in order to afford the maximum
                            of protection to the Talara area. The plans are as follows: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The War Department is prepared to dispatch to Talara as soon as
                                    practicable, 1 heavy bombardment squadron, 1 pursuit flight,
                                    service units, and 1 platoon of infantry, reinforced. This
                                    involves 8 heavy bombardment airplanes, 8 pursuit fighters,
                                    miscellaneous equipment, and approximately 750 officers and
                                    men.</p>
                                <p>It is proposed to send the ground elements of this force to Peru
                                    by water transportation from Panama as soon as permission is
                                    granted by the Peruvian Government. The airplanes are to be
                                    flown in as soon as service facilities are ready to receive
                                    them.</p>
                                <pb n="501" xml:id="pg_501" facs="0509"/>
                                <p>It is desired to concentrate this force at the Talara airport
                                    initially, with the right reserved to use such other Peruvian
                                    landing fields in that general area as circumstances may
                                    require.</p>
                                <p>Since the employment of the above force, based on Peruvian
                                    territory, bears directly on the defense of the Panama Canal,
                                    every effort which you can make to obtain the prompt and
                                    favorable consideration of Peruvian authorities to this proposal
                                    will be greatly appreciated.</p>
                                <p>No steps will, of course, be taken to place this plan in effect,
                                    pending further advice from you.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>I suggest that should you see no reason to the contrary, you discuss this
                            suggestion directly with the President and make it clear to him that the
                            proposal offers, in the judgment of this Government, the best evidence
                            of the desire of the United States to take every necessary measure, in
                            cooperation with Peru, to prevent any acts of hostility on the part of
                            Axis powers against the territory of Peru.</p>
                        <p>Please telegraph as soon as possible the reply that may be made to you.

                            summary of a long conversation which I had with the President this

                                <item>I emphasized that our request for the use of an air base at
                                    Talara is due primarily to the need for adequate defense of the
                                    Canal, which is a matter of vital importance to the entire west
                                    coast; that the United States has no desire to take from the
                                    Peruvian forces any part whatever of their duty and right to
                                    defend national territory; that while the long distance patrol
                                    from Talara would afford incidental protection to this valuable
                                    Peruvian area the main objective is cooperation in hemisphere
                                    defense and that there must have been some misunderstanding
                                    about the request which we had made.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>The President stated that there is no objection to allowing us
                                    to use Talara for long range patrols, but that for psychological
                                    reasons there must be at the same time some positive act of

                                    the United States before the Japanese attack. He pointed out
                                    that if we could furnish, for example, a few planes that the
                                    Peruvian Air Force <pb n="502" xml:id="pg_502" facs="0510"
                                    />could use for coastal patrol work and if a Peruvian aviator
                                    was lost or suffered any injury while on such duty it would
                                    immediately arouse and unite the country behind an energetic
                                    program for hemisphere defense. The President emphasized this
                                    psychological factor and said that he needed at least an
                                    immediate token supply of defense equipment from the United
                                    States in order to have the support of the Peruvian people in

                                    States planes started to use the Talara base. He observed that
                                    Peru would be inviting attack and would be vulnerable once our

                        <p>98. Department’s telegram No. 52, March 28, 6 p.m. President Prado was
                            very gratified with the message for him about the cancellation of the
                            Lufthansa contract, and when I gave it to him Sunday morning at a
                            meeting in connection with the geographical conference he called the
                            Foreign Minister<note n="18" xml:id="d405fn18">Alfredo Solf y

                            say. The President stated that action in the Lufthansa case is one step
                            in Peru’s cooperation in hemisphere; that we may expect similar “frank
                            and convincing” cooperation in other matters; and that the Peruvian
                            Government is determined to give full support to the United States in
                            measures for the protection of the American continents.</p>
                        <p>The President’s attitude indicates that Peruvian policy now is moving
                            toward decisive action along the same lines as our own and reflects an
                            opinion similar to the Brazilian one in this respect. It will be most
                            useful to me in future conversations with the Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs to be able to refer to the President’s unequivocal
                            statements.</p>
                        <p>If the strength of the present administration in Peru is maintained so
                            that the President’s expressed policies can be made effective the
                            situation here will be greatly improved. … I am encouraged by the
                            President’s declaration …</p>

                        <p>105. My telegram No. 98, March 31, 11 a.m. Following up his promise to me
                            that he planned to make a public statement soon expressing his full
                            support for the policies and actions of President Roosevelt, President
                            Prado did so last evening in the course of his address promulgating the
                            new education law. He said that he shared fully the ideas and the
                            “policy of action” of the President of the United States which translate
                            the desires of peoples to safeguard their liberties, institutions and

                        <p>59. The Department has considered carefully your despatches and telegrams
                            on the aviation situation in Peru as well as report no. 16 of February
                            7, 1941 prepared by the Military Attaché.<note n="19" xml:id="d407fn19"
                                >Lt. Col. Uzal G. Ent; report No. 16 not printed.</note></p>
                        <p>It now seems probable that priorities will be obtained for four small
                            hydroplanes for the Faucett Airline for use to Iquitos and for other
                            schedules, particularly in that section, as suggested in the report
                            under reference from the Military Attaché. It also seems probable that
                            this Government will be able to render financial assistance both for the
                            purchase of these airplanes and for the improvement of landing fields
                            and navigation facilities should such assistance be necessary. This
                            assistance would be rendered, of course, for the purpose of preventing
                            the penetration of non-American interests into Peruvian aviation and
                            would be contingent on assurances that the Peruvian Government would not
                            extend franchises to such elements.</p>
                        <p>The Department is gratified that the Peruvian Government has cancelled
                            the Lufthansa franchise. It is understood that Panagra is duplicating
                            this service and that it will therefore not be necessary to augment
                            Panagra’s schedules for the time being. As you are no doubt aware, the
                            present difficulty of obtaining airplanes and flight crews makes it
                            necessary to allocate the few available where they will accomplish a
                            definite purpose, principally the elimination of German influence or the
                            extension of strategic lines.</p>
                        <p>The Department will appreciate receiving your further recommendations and
                            the views of the Peruvian Government and Mr. Faucett concerning the
                            assistance which this Government might render in the form of airplanes,
                            flight personnel, improvement of landing fields and so forth. You should
                            not, until receiving further instructions upon the basis of your
                            subsequent reports, commit this Government in any way.</p>

                        <p>The reconstruction of the 5 following airports in the order named:
                            Talara, Iquitos, Chiclayo, Lima and Quipa, with installation of complete
                            communications, meteorological and lighting units; communications and
                            meteorological units would also be installed in 10 additional landing
                            fields now in existence. The whole project to be Government-owned and
                            controlled.</p>
                        <p>The cost of the reconstruction of the above 5 fields is estimated at 2
                            million dollars, with an additional million dollars for the installation
                            of the communications, meteorological and lighting units. With respect
                            to the 4 small airplanes for which there is a probability of priority,
                            it is strongly recommended that these planes be made available to the
                            Peruvian National Airline, operated under the executive administration
                            of the United States Aviation Mission as a part of the Peruvian Air
                            Corps. The planes could be put into immediate use in the Iquitos
                            service. This recommendation is made regardless the fact that they may
                            be used near the disputed area<note n="20" xml:id="d408fn20">For

                            take care of the needs of his expanding services for the next year by

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With reference to the Embassy’s telegram
                            145 of April 24, 1941, 3 p.m., setting forth preliminary recommendations
                            with respect to the reconstruction of airports in Peru, I have the honor
                            to report that the Minister of Finance informed me yesterday that by
                            direction of the President he has been charged with the supervision of
                            the development of civil aviation in Peru. As a first step in the
                            Minister’s program and with the concurrence of all of the Peruvian
                            authorities concerned, he proposes the reconstruction of the five
                            airports mentioned in our telegram under reference and two additional
                            airports, probably at Cuzco and Tingo María. In order that the plan may
                            be carried out as soon as possible, Mr. Dasso is desirous of obtaining
                            the services of a competent engineer or engineers to make a preliminary
                            survey of the work to be done on the seven airports under consideration,
                            and has requested me to ask the Department’s aid in obtaining the
                            services of the engineer or engineers in question.</p>
                        <p>Colonel James T. Moore, U. S. M. C, Chief of the United States Aviation
                            Mission to Peru, recommends that a competent engineer be sent
                            immediately to make a preliminary survey of the airfields and an
                            estimate of the materials required and the cost of construction. Colonel
                            U. G. Ent, the Military Attaché, suggests that the engineer designated
                            consult with our War and Navy Departments before coming to Peru.</p>
                        <p>As for the financial arrangements, the Minister seemed to expect that we
                            would be prepared to supply the necessary initial capital. Peru’s share
                            of this outlay to be determined by mutual agreement and to be repaid
                            over a long term through especially earmarked taxes.</p>
                        <p>I heartily endorse the recommendation of the Minister of Finance as well

                                Minister of Marine and Aviation has sent a note to the Foreign
                                Office requesting that one United States Army engineer officer be
                                sent to Peru for the purpose of making a survey of airport
                                extensions and other needed facilities. Further, that one Air Corps

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: The Government of Peru purchased
                            from the Government of Norway, by a contract signed on August 15, 1941,
                            18 Douglas Airplanes, Model 8A–5. The Department of State was informed
                            in good time of the negotiations which concluded with the purchase of
                            that material by my Government, as the vendor requested.</p>
                        <p>The transfer of title having been perfected on the date indicated above,
                            the Peruvian Government solicited of the United States Government, by a
                                note<note n="23" xml:id="d411fn23">Not printed.</note> which I had
                            the honor to address to Your Excellency on the 19th of the same month of
                            August, the facilities necessary for the transit of the airplanes from
                            Toronto, Canada, where they had been purchased, to the port of New York,
                            whence they were to be shipped to Callao, Peru. For this purpose, my
                            Government decided to send to New York the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Marañón</hi>, a vessel belonging to the Peruvian Steamship Company
                            [Compañía Peruana de Vapores].<note n="24" xml:id="d411fn24">Brackets

                        <pb n="509" xml:id="pg_509" facs="0517"/>
                        <p>On August 30, 1941, the Department of State was good enough to inform
                            this Embassy<note n="25" xml:id="d411fn25">Communication not
                                printed.</note> to the effect that it would give immediate
                            consideration to the applications for licenses which were made for the
                            importation from Canada and the exportation to Peru of the 18 Douglas
                            airplanes, Model 8A–5, to which I refer, and shortly afterward the
                            corresponding licenses were issued by the Department of State.</p>
                        <p>All these formalities having been complied with, the Embassy in my charge
                            was disagreeably surprised on Monday, September 22 last, by the
                            information that, by direction of the Collector of Customs of New York,
                            and at the time when the Peruvian airplanes were loaded, some on board
                            the <hi rend="italic">Marañón</hi> and some on the Grace Line ship <hi
                                rend="italic">Santa Rita</hi>, it was ordered that they should again
                            be placed on land on the pretext that the content of the cases
                            “belonging to a foreign government” would first have to be examined by
                            the customs authorities. Later, the same Collector, Mr. Durning, alleged
                            that the operation of unloading that was required was made necessary by
                            the circumstance that goods belonging to Norway were involved, whose
                            funds and credits are frozen in the United States.</p>
                        <p>The unjustified reasons given for making the arbitrary action of the New
                            York Customs Service appear proper and the fact that, in disregard of
                            elemental duties of international courtesy, no suggestion or notice
                            capable of explaining in any way the unloading that was ordered was
                            given to my Government in due time, led me to believe sincerely that in
                            this whole question there was nothing more than a serious error
                            committed by the customs officials of the port of New York.</p>
                        <p>With this conviction, I have been discussing the matter verbally with the
                            Department of State, starting on that said Monday, September 22, 1941
                            and continuing until today, to the end of clearing up this troublesome
                            matter, and the time has come when I must go on record before Your
                            Excellency to the effect that I have not yet been able to obtain the
                            necessary reparation on the part of the United States Government. Far
                            from it, I have been told that “possibly” the War Department has shown
                            interest in the detention of the Peruvian airplanes and that this
                            interest must undoubtedly be the cause of the whole occurrence.</p>
                        <p>It certainly would not be friendly under the present circumstances, while
                            still awaiting the definitive reply of Your Excellency, for me to adduce
                            any reason contrary to the purpose which might be attributed to the War
                            Department of this country, of disposing freely of material of foreign
                            ownership. The Government of Peru well knows that the domestic and
                            international policy of the United States is adjusted to the principles
                            of law, and it would not venture to offer to this nation <pb n="510"
                                xml:id="pg_510" facs="0518"/>the offense of supposing that,
                            disregarding the legal norms which guarantee the property system and
                            forgetting the mutual consideration owed to each other by states, it
                            should commit such a serious infraction as would be the act of depriving
                            its legitimate owner of a thing which legally belongs to him.</p>
                        <p>It is for this reason that the present note which I am sending to Your
                            Excellency, in compliance with special instructions from the Government
                            of Peru, is limited to protesting energetically against the arbitrary
                            detention which the New York Custom House has made of the 18 Douglas
                            airplanes, Model 8A–5, belonging to Peru, which should have started for
                            Callao two weeks ago, and to request that immediate and categorical
                            orders be given that this aviation matériel may be transported to its
                            place of destination without loss of time.</p>
                        <p>My Government likewise instructs me to protest formally, as I do, against
                            the abuse committed by the Collector of Customs of New York in
                            preventing the shipping of articles of commerce belonging to the
                            Peruvian State and to declare to Your Excellency, as I likewise do, that
                            it hopes from the United States Government, in its rectification, that
                            damages and losses occasioned to Peru by the forced stay at New York of
                            the steamer <hi rend="italic">Marañón</hi> since September 22, 1941 will
                            be recognized and paid for, as well as all the expenses which it has had
                            to incur through the unloading of eight airplanes from the steamer <hi
                                rend="italic">Santa Rita</hi> and the holding of the same on
                            lighters and piers of the said port of New York.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, my Government reserves the right to claim from that of Your
                            Excellency whatever indemnification may be due because of the injurious
                            effects that the action of the climate might have on the goods belonging
                            to it, held without legal basis by order of agents of the United States
                            Government.</p>

                        <p>551. The Secretary General of the Peruvian Ministry of Foreign Affairs
                            asked me to call today to discuss with him a matter that the President
                            had requested him to take up with me. The principal subject of our
                            conversation was the retention of the 18 planes purchased from the
                            Norwegian Government by the Peruvian Government.</p>
                        <p>The United Press despatch of last evening regarding the division [<hi
                                rend="italic">diversion?</hi>] of these planes to Russia was
                            censored here and has not been published. Dr. Bellido considers the
                            diversion of these planes <pb n="511" xml:id="pg_511" facs="0519"/>as
                            unfriendly. I took immediate exception to this and replied that it was a
                            case of the planes being more urgently needed elsewhere. Dr. Bellido
                            then said that Peruvian resentment was due to the manner in which the
                            case had been handled. I suggested that any observations regarding this
                            phase might be made by the Peruvian Ambassador at Washington to the
                            Department. Dr. Bellido stated that this might be done and that he hoped
                            that the Department would make some clarifying statement. I replied that
                            if Peru were to make any statement regarding the case I supposed that
                            naturally my Government would also make a statement; and that I believed
                            the entire matter should be viewed as a contribution which Peru could
                            make to the defense of the cause of democracies. …</p>

                            note of October 6, 1941 regarding eighteen airplanes, Douglas model
                            8A–5, purchased by the Peruvian Government and in transit through the
                            United States to Peru, I have the honor to inform Your Excellency that
                            the War Department has found it necessary in the interests of national
                            defense to requisition these airplanes. Appropriate steps are being
                            taken in this respect under the authority of the Act of October 10, 1940
                            (Public No. 829—76th Congress)<note n="26" xml:id="d414fn26">54 Stat.

                            Order of the President, dated October 15, 1940<note n="27"

                        <p>It is regretted that the Peruvian Government may have been inconvenienced
                            by the requisitioning of these airplanes by this Government. I believe
                            Your Excellency and Your Excellency’s Government will agree, however,
                            that in the present critical world situation it is of vital interest to
                            all of the American republics that such rapid and effective action be
                            taken whenever necessary to utilize airplanes and other scarce
                            implements of war to defend this continent in the ways that may be
                            decided to be most advantageous strategically by those now engaged in
                            that defense. With the rapidly expanding airplane production facilities
                            of this country it will soon be possible to provide the other American
                            republics with such aviation equipment as they may need for defense
                            against non-American aggression. At this time it nevertheless continues
                            to be necessary to exercise every precaution, and even such mandatory
                            powers as those used in the present instance, to insure the complete
                            mobility of the available mechanized equipment that is so essential for
                            the protection of the American republics. I assure Your Excellency that
                            the Government of the United States will of course continue fully to
                            collaborate with Peru and the other American republics in all matters
                            related to continental defense.</p>

                        <p>405. Your 552 undated. The Peruvian Ambassador in a call which he was
                            asked to make by the Under Secretary yesterday expressed his regret at
                            the unfortunate and erroneous impressions conveyed by certain statements
                            which have appeared in the press attributed to Colonel Revoredo. The
                            Ambassador stated that Colonel Revoredo had made no statements
                            derogatory in any way to the United States. In view of this
                            clarification the Under Secretary said that he considered the matter
                            closed. The press has reported this morning that Revoredo has
                            resigned.</p>
                        <p>With reference to your 551, October 15, 4 p.m., the Department has taken
                            the same position with the Peruvian Embassy in Washington concerning the
                            planes which you took at the Foreign Office.</p>

                            in requisitioning the 18 Peruvian airplanes. For example, on May 27,
                            1941, at the request of the United States Army Air Corps in the
                            Philippine Islands, this Government seized 16 airplanes and spare parts
                            owned by the Thai Royal Air Force of Thailand,<note n="33"

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: I have had the honor of receiving
                            Your Excellency’s courteous notes of the 17th and 20th of the current
                            month, both referring to the requisition of 18 Douglas planes, model
                            8A–5, belonging to the Government of Peru, which were in transit through
                            territory of the United States.</p>
                        <p>My Government had hoped that the reasons set forth in this Embassy’s note
                            of the 6th instant would induce Your Excellency to order the immediate
                            return of the airplanes held in the port of New York to their legitimate
                            owner; and it does indeed deplore the fact that such decision has not
                            yet been taken, in violation of the fundamental rights of my country and
                            with obvious disregard of every friendly consideration.</p>
                        <p>The preoccupation which dominates Your Excellency’s Government with
                            respect to the problem of continental defense is also felt by the
                            Government of Peru in the natural relativity of affairs. A sign of that
                            preoccupation is constituted by all the statements and acts which Peru
                            has recently made and performed in its eagerness to cooperate in the
                            preservation of the vital interests of America.</p>
                        <p>But my Government has given, and is willing to continue giving such
                            cooperation on the basis of absolute respect on the part of all the <pb
                                n="516" xml:id="pg_516" facs="0524"/>American Republics of the
                            principle of the juridical quality of States. Freely, in the exercise of
                            its attributes of sovereignty and in conformity with its own
                            legislation, Peru could also have considered any suggestions which might
                            have been made to it by the Government of the United States to the end
                            that the planes belonging to it, in transit through American territory,
                            be applied to meet supreme and undeferable needs of the armed defense of
                            this Hemisphere. But Peru can by no means agree that another State,
                            without consulting it and arrogating to itself a title which Peru is not
                            willing to recognize to any nation, no matter how powerful it may be,
                            may claim the right to decide unilaterally concerning goods which have
                            already become part of Peru’s physical wealth. Such action is not only
                            unfriendly, it is in open conflict with the Pan American spirit.</p>
                        <p>My Government also considers that the attitude of the Government of the
                            United States does not rest on any sort of legal basis. It is true that
                            the law of October 10, 1940 authorizes the President to requisition and
                            attach certain military and naval items in the interest of national
                            defense, but only such items as had been “ordered, manufactured,
                            procured or possessed for the purpose of exportation” in American
                            territory. The law referred to does not in any way allude to goods in
                            transit, and the 18 Douglas airplanes, model 8A–5, which had been
                            shipped at Toronto, Canada, and were consigned to Callao, Peru, were
                            passing through this country on a journey which had begun and was to end
                            outside the borders within which United States territorial law governs.
                            The law of October 10, 1940 could not contain provisions contrary to the
                            postulates on freedom of transit proclaimed by international law,
                            postulates which the Government of this nation has on multiple occasions
                            made its own; and it is for that reason that there was only included
                            among its precepts the authorization for the President of the United
                            States to requisition and attach goods intended for export. Such is the
                            conclusion one unavoidably reaches in reviewing its structure. If this
                            were not the case, this legislative work would constitute a menace for
                            the security of international commerce.</p>
                        <p>My Government firmly believes, then, that the act of which it has
                            protested and does protest is not based on any legal provision and,
                            trusting in Your Excellency’s high sense of justice, instructs me once
                            more to request the immediate return of the 18 Douglas planes, model
                            8A–5, held in the port of New York, and to renew its just claim for the
                            damages and prejudices which it is being occasioned by the action
                            injurious to its right and interests which has been perpetrated by the
                            authorities of the United States.</p>

                        <p>566. At the Foreign Service conference meeting this morning the chiefs of
                            the United States aviation and naval missions emphatically expressed the
                            opinion that the requisition of the 18 planes has completely disrupted
                            the work of their missions. The most extreme anti-United States attacks
                            are being made from the floor of the Senate and are being published in
                            the press and broadcast by radio. The son of and the nephew of Rafael

                                rend="italic">La Crónica</hi> of Lima called today again to state
                            that the present situation is being used to undermine the entire
                            pro-democratic campaign, the support of President Roosevelt and his
                            policies and that anti-American feeling is stronger and more widespread
                            than they have ever known [it] to be. They added that reactionary
                            Peruvian elements and totalitarian interests are capitalizing on events
                            to the fullest extent, while friends of the United States are helpless
                            to fight back.</p>
                        <p>The most unhappy stage which relations between Peru and the United States
                            have reached has impressed Bonsal through his conversation with the
                            Minister of Finance,<note n="36" xml:id="d421fn36">David Dasso.</note>
                            General Melgar<note n="37" xml:id="d421fn37">Gen. Fernando Melgar
                                earlier in the year had visited the United States to study aviation

                            very warm friends of the United States and of the democratic cause. It
                            must also be emphasized Peru is interested in obtaining the exact type
                            of bomber which was requisitioned and would not be particularly
                            interested in substitutes. This is confirmed by Colonel Ent and is due
                            to the requirements of Peru’s actual aviation establishment and training
                            program. It is possible that the situation might be considerably
                            improved if the War Department could give some indication as to a date,
                            preferably not over 3 to 6 months hence, when the exigencies of our
                            national defense program might make it possible to begin to replace
                            these. If this suggestion meets with the Department’s approval, it is
                            further suggested that the visit to Washington of Rafael Larco Herrera
                            scheduled to take place within the next few days, will furnish an
                            excellent opportunity for an announcement in the sense proposed.</p>

                        <p>In reply to the Embassy’s statement that the action of the Government of
                            the United States in seizing the airplanes does not rest on any legal
                            basis, it may be pointed out that the planes are in the United States.
                            They are therefore subject to the jurisdiction and amenable to the laws
                            of the United States whatever may be their origin and whatever
                            destination may have been intended for them. The Act of October 10, 1940
                            (Public, Numbered 829, Seventy-sixth Congress) authorizes the President,
                            when he determines that it is necessary in the interest of national
                            defense, to requisition and take over any military or naval equipment,
                            munitions, et cetera, “ordered, manufactured, procured, or possessed for
                            export purposes, the exportation of which has been denied in accordance
                            with the provisions of section 6 of the Act approved July 2, 1940
                            (Public, Numbered 703, Seventy-sixth Congress).”<note n="40"
                                xml:id="d423fn40">54 Stat. 712.</note> The airplanes in question are
                            admittedly possessed for the purpose of export to Peru. Their export has
                            been denied in accordance with the provisions of section 6 of the Act
                            approved July 2, 1940 (Public, Numbered 703, Seventy-sixth Congress) by
                            the revocation of the export license issued in accordance with the
                            provisions of section 6. The case is therefore clearly within the terms
                            of the Act of October 10, 1940.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy’s note expresses the view that the Act of October 10, 1940
                            cannot “contain provisions contrary to the postulates on freedom of
                            transit proclaimed by international law.” If this means that there <pb
                                n="519" xml:id="pg_519" facs="0527"/>is an absolute right for the
                            transportation of foreign property across the territory of a state this
                            Government knows of no such right under international law. The
                            jurisdiction of a nation over its own territory is absolute and any
                            exemption or immunity from such jurisdiction rests solely on the
                            nation’s consent. It is not understood that the Government of Peru
                            contends that it enjoys any such immunity. Every state undoubtedly
                            possesses the right in case of emergency and subject to compensation to
                            seize any foreign property on its territory.</p>

                        <p>The Ambassador of Peru called to see me at my request. I told the
                            Ambassador that as an indication of the very real desire of the
                            Government of the United States to recognize the difficulties created
                            for the Government of Peru by the requisitioning by this Government of
                            the 18 bombers which the Peruvian Government had bought and which were
                            in transshipment through the United States for Peru, I wished to inquire
                            whether the Government of Peru would view favorably the substitution of
                            18 primary trainers for the requisitioned bombers, the difference in
                            value, of course, to be compensated for by the United States Government.
                            I said it had been my understanding that what the Peruvian Government
                            particularly desired was to have airplanes for the training of their
                            pilots and that the category of planes requisitioned was not the chief
                            difficulty, but rather the fact that 18 planes had been taken which
                            would have been of service in affording flying facilities for their
                            aviators.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that this was exactly the case and that he personally
                            greatly regretted the fact that the Peruvian Government had bought
                            bombers rather than training planes in the first place. He said this
                            fact had given rise to assumptions which he trusted were unfounded. He
                            said that he would at once communicate with his Government and inform me
                            of their point of view and that in the event that it was favorable, he
                            would then respond affirmatively to an official note which I would
                            direct to him in the sense indicated.</p>

                            Concha said that he had been requested by Ambassador Freyre to let me

                            airplanes, but to liquidate the matter as quickly as possible, and that
                            he would consequently prefer to obtain full compensation for the
                            airplanes requisitioned and not to have trainers as part compensation

                            Excellency’s courteous note dated October 20 last, in which Your
                            Excellency states, in the second paragraph, that your Government is
                            prepared to give immediate and full compensation to the Government of
                            Peru for the attachment of 18 Douglas airplanes belonging to the
                            Peruvian Government that were requisitioned by the United States Army at
                            the Port of New York.</p>
                        <p>In accordance with instructions from my Government, I have the honor to
                            present to Your Excellency today, for the aforementioned purposes, a
                            statement of the value of the said airplanes, and of the expenses
                            incurred in transporting them from Toronto to New York, as well as the
                            expenses of the trip from Peru to Canada of several Air Force officers
                            of my country to inspect them.</p>
                        <p>My Government paid the Norwegian Government, in accordance with a
                            contract signed August 15, 1941, the sum of $1,234,800.00 for the 18
                            airplanes. To this amount should be added $8,633.80 for the <pb n="521"
                                xml:id="pg_521" facs="0529"/>cost of transporting them from Canada
                            to New York; and $3,364.50 for the passage and expenses of the Peruvian
                            officers. This makes a total of one million, two hundred forty-six
                            thousand, seven hundred ninety-eight dollars and thirty cents
                            ($1,246,798.30), and I shall be grateful if Your Excellency will have
                            that amount paid to the Government of Peru.</p>
                        <p>I should like to state, at the same time, that the above sum is only the
                            value of the 18 Douglas airplanes and the expenses directly connected
                            with their purchase. My Government reserves the right to make a
                            subsequent claim for damages and losses suffered as a result of the
                            forced detention of the vessel <hi rend="italic">Marañón</hi> and other

                            requisitioned by the United States Government had been deposited in the
                            Reserve Bank in Lima, and to the Department’s telegraphic reply number
                            468 of November 19 [<hi rend="italic">18</hi>], 1941, 6 P.M.<note n="42"

                                xml:id="pg_522" facs="0530"/>that no agreement had been arrived at
                            in regard to the matter of compensation for these planes.</p>
                        <p>As the Department is aware from communications which have been sent from
                            this Embassy, the action taken by the American authorities in suddenly
                            preventing delivery of these planes has been productive of much ill will
                            toward the United States in responsible Peruvian quarters.</p>
                        <p>While adverse comment has indeed died down in the interval the matter,
                            and more particularly the manner of sequestration has by no means been
                            forgotten, and is I am convinced playing a part in Peruvian hesitation
                            to permit the United States Army Air Corps to utilize desired facilities
                            at Talara.<note n="43" xml:id="d428fn43">See <ref target="#pg_498">pp.
                                    498</ref> ff.</note> Indeed, President Prado in speaking on the
                            28th instant at the exercises attending the end of the scholastic year
                            of the Aeronautical Officers School, alluded to the Government’s desire
                            to build up the Peruvian air corps stating that, while certain equipment
                            had been received, “unfortunately as you are well aware, reasons
                            superior to our will have so far prevented our attaining these prime
                            necessities in spite of our having taken all appropriate measures
                            opportunely and with foresight”.</p>
                        <p>With a view to facilitating Peruvian approval of the necessary war
                            measures, and considering that compensation for the planes must
                            eventually be made, I urgently recommend that the United States
                            Government promptly effect a first payment amounting, if possible, to
                            the value of the planes, as evidenced by the sum understood to have been
                            paid by the Peruvian Government to representatives of that of Norway,
                            leaving questions relating to damages for eventual legal settlement.
                            Although it is understood that the United States Government is disposed
                            to allow the Peruvian Government to claim compensation through ordinary
                            legal channels, it would seem perfectly possible for at least initial
                            payment to be made without recourse to the courts. I believe that such
                            action on the part of the United States Government would have a
                            definitely beneficial effect on our negotiations with the Peruvian
                            authorities for permission to base units of our air force on Peruvian
                            territory.</p>

                            Excellency’s note of October 21, 1941 regarding the requisitioning of
                            certain airplanes <pb n="523" xml:id="pg_523" facs="0531"/>in transit
                            through the United States from Canada to Peru, and to your note of
                            December 20 [<hi rend="italic">12</hi>], 1941 requesting compensation
                            for these same airplanes.</p>
                        <p>In accordance with the announced intention of this Government in this
                            case and the established procedure of paying adequate compensation for
                            requisitioned material, it is my pleasure to advise you that the United
                            States has agreed to pay to Your Excellency’s Government the sum of
                            $1,266,729.32, a check for which has already been delivered to Your
                                Excellency.<note n="44" xml:id="d429fn44">On January 13,
                                1942.</note></p>
                        <p>In the present instance, the legal basis for the action of the Government
                            of the United States in requisitioning the airplanes rests on the fact
                            that the planes, whatever may have been their origin and destination,
                            were in the United States and therefore subject to its jurisdiction and
                            amenable to its laws. The Act of October 10, 1940 (Public, Numbered 829,
                            Seventy-sixth Congress) authorizes the President, when he determines
                            that it is necessary in the interest of national defense, to requisition
                            and take over any military or naval equipment, munitions, et cetera,
                            “ordered, manufactured, procured, or possessed for export purposes, the
                            exportation of which has been denied in accordance with the provisions
                            of section 6 of the Act approved July 2, 1940 (Public, Numbered 703,
                            Seventy-sixth Congress).” The airplanes in question were admittedly
                            possessed for the purpose of export to Peru. Their export has been
                            denied in accordance with the provisions of section 6 of the Act
                            approved July 2, 1940 (Public, Numbered 703, Seventy-sixth Congress) by
                            the revocation of the export license issued in accordance with the
                            provisions of section 6. The case is therefore clearly within the terms
                            of the Act of October 10, 1940.</p>
                        <p>As I indicated in my note of October 17, it is regretted that the
                            Peruvian Government has been inconvenienced by the requisitioning of
                            these airplanes, and I hope that Your Excellency and Your Excellency’s
                            Government, in sympathetic understanding of the fact that it was
                            impracticable to give prior notice, will find it possible to agree that
                            the seizure of the airplanes was necessitated by the exigencies of
                            national defense. This point of view has been adequately justified, as I
                            am sure Your Excellency’s Government will agree, by the felonious attack
                            of Japan on the United States on December 7, 1941.</p>
                        <p>My Government has noted with deep appreciation Your Excellency’s
                            statement that the Government of Peru shares the preoccupation of my
                            Government with the problem of continental defense. It is gratifying to
                            the Government and the people of the United States that Your
                            Excellency’s Government, realizing the importance of <pb n="524"

                            an agreement with the Peruvian Government whereby the Metals Reserve
                            Company will acquire all of the Peruvian production of antimony,
                            tungsten, molybdenum, vanadium, lead, copper, zinc, and bismuth except
                            such of these materials as may be required for domestic use in Peru and
                            except such materials as may be exported to other Latin American
                            republics which have established export control systems in collaboration
                            with the United States Government. Such an agreement would not interfere
                            with the normal flow of these materials to private purchasers in the
                            United States market. The agreement would be for 2 years and would have
                            a top limit of the amounts of each material which Metals Reserve would
                            be required to buy. Metals Reserve would however have an option to buy
                            all Peruvian production of each material in excess of these stipulated
                            top limits which would not be absorbed by domestic use in Peru or the
                            United States or by exports to Latin American countries having approved
                            export control systems. During the life of the agreement the Peruvian
                            Government would prohibit the export of the materials subject to the
                            contract except to the United States and other Latin <pb n="525"

                                xml:id="d431fn49">Not printed.</note> The Minister of Finance<note
                                n="50" xml:id="d431fn50">David Dasso.</note> stated today that the
                            matter must be submitted to the Cabinet for consideration and an

                            he said that Peru hesitated to impose a prohibition of exports of
                            domestic products, particularly where contracts had been made for future
                            deliveries. Furthermore, he said that he did not wish to make Peru the
                            spearhead in the imposition of such drastic restrictions for fear of
                            international complications and that he would prefer to see at least
                            four or five of the other American Republics announce such a decision
                            about the same time.</p>

                        <p>181. Referring to the Department’s telegram No. 99, May 15, 8 p.m. The
                            contents of the Department’s telegram under reference <pb n="526"
                                xml:id="pg_526" facs="0534"/>were brought to the attention of the
                            Minister of Finance this afternoon who discussed the matter in an
                            entirely unofficial and personal way. The Minister stated that this
                            matter would have to be discussed with the Cabinet and the President and
                            a reply would not be available before Wednesday or Thursday of next
                            week. The Minister’s personal opinion is that the Government, because of
                            a number of existing contracts, may prefer not to negotiate for the
                            producers. Owing to the fact that these contracts are with the Japanese
                            he undoubtedly has in mind the fear that the stoppage of imports of
                            cotton now amounting to over 1 million dollars per month by the Japanese
                            in retaliation could create a serious political situation for the
                            administration.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, the Minister while making no commitment recommended that a
                            representative of Metals Reserve should come to Peru to negotiate with
                            individual producers directly but that the Government would lend all
                            facilities for that purpose including those of the official mining and
                            industrial banks.</p>
                        <p>The Minister inquired whether the United States would be willing to
                            restrict the use by the Japanese of dollar credits through American
                            banks for the purchase of Peruvian minerals. The Minister remarked: “If
                            we are bucking them let us do it in a thorough manner and make it look
                            like a united front”; rather than make it appear as if Peru were “out in
                            front”.</p>
                        <p>In view of the foregoing and my 180 of today there now seems to be some
                            hesitancy on the part of the Peruvian Government in view of the local
                            reaction to the recent proposal for the use of friendly offices in the
                            boundary dispute,<note n="51" xml:id="d432fn51">For correspondence

                            that negotiations by the Metals Reserve Company directly with the
                            individual producers would attain the object we are seeking, namely, the
                            acquisition of the entire exportable surplus of the various commodities
                            which the Metals Reserve desires to buy, unless these negotiations would
                            be supported by an export control or some other governmental regulation
                            which would prohibit the export of the materials subject to the
                            agreement to any country other than the United <pb n="527"
                                xml:id="pg_527" facs="0535"/>States. Unless there were such control
                            of exports, the result would only be competitive buying which would not
                            achieve the purpose of this Government.</p>
                        <p>The Department understands the reluctance of the Peruvian Government to
                            be the first to put such a regulation into effect. For your confidential
                            information, however, arrangements are being made which it is hoped
                            will, when announced, change the attitude of the Peruvian Government in
                            this respect. Arrangements have been made with Brazil for the imposition
                            of such an embargo on a list of materials which will be bought by the
                            Federal Loan Agency and it is hoped that an announcement of this
                            arrangement will be made soon. An agreement has been made with Bolivia
                            as you know for the purchase of its tin production and a similar
                            arrangement has just been completed for the purchase of the entire
                            tungsten production of Bolivia. The latter agreement will be accompanied
                            by a customs regulation prohibiting the export of tungsten except to the
                            United States. Negotiations are also about to be begun with Mexico and
                            Argentina along the same lines. All of the above, except the two
                            Bolivian agreements, is strictly confidential but when we will be free
                            to refer to these arrangements and negotiations it is hoped that their
                            existence will dispose of this objection on the part of the Peruvian
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>The existence of contracts with the Japanese is not in itself an
                            insuperable obstacle as it might be possible to recognize these
                            contracts and to allow them to be fulfilled if they are not in too large
                            an amount and do not cover too long a period of time.</p>
                        <p>The matter of restricting the use by the Japanese of dollar credits
                            through American Banks is under consideration. We will advise you
                            shortly if developments along this line take place.</p>
                        <p>The Department is also aware of the difficulty caused by the large
                            purchases by the Japanese of Peruvian cotton. This matter is also being
                            studied by the Department and further advices will be sent to you
                            shortly.</p>
                        <p>While it is impossible to discuss these other negotiations, the possible
                            regulation of dollar credits, and the cotton situation with the Peruvian
                            Government at present, it is hoped that you will use your best efforts
                            to prevent the Government of Peru from taking a firm position at this
                            time against export control. The important thing now is to keep the
                            negotiations open and to make it clear to the Peruvian Government that
                            no effective arrangement can be made for the purchase of the entire
                            exportable surplus of the strategic and critical Peruvian materials
                            unless some form of effective export control is a part of the
                            arrangement.</p>

                        <p>215. Reference to my telegram No. 180, May 16, 7 p.m. The Finance
                            Minister informed the Ambassador last evening that the Government is now
                            disposed to make effective export and reexport control. The matter is
                            under consideration by the Cabinet but the details have not yet been
                            worked out. The Minister said Peru proposes to restrict exports of alloy
                            metals and ores to countries that are supplying Peru promptly and freely
                            with iron and steel products and that this will eliminate Japan which
                            cannot supply even a keg of nails.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Dasso stated that the British Government is also interested in the
                            control of strategic minerals and had Peru take £900,000 of this year’s
                            cotton crop on condition that the exportation of these minerals is
                            controlled. By the purchase of this amount of cotton it is hoped to
                            regularize the sterling exchange situation and to meet pending service
                            on the guano and electric power company loans.</p>

                        <p>130. Reference Legation’s 215 of June 7. The following is drawn up after
                            discussion with Ambassador Norweb.<note n="52" xml:id="d435fn52"
                                >Ambassador Norweb left Peru on June 7 for the United States and
                                returned to Peru about July 1.</note></p>
                        <p>The Department welcomes the growing readiness of the Peruvian Government
                            to take effective action in regard to the control of exports. It
                            believes it advisable that, in the matter of timing action, a
                            distinction be borne in mind between the two following groups of
                            commodities: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>As regards products imported from the United States, and
                                    similar products that might be substituted therefor, immediate
                                    action is greatly to be desired. This will both assure Peru of
                                    supplies and facilitate our own decision in granting licenses
                                    for export to Peru.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>As regards commodities produced in Brazil [<hi rend="italic"
                                        >Peru?</hi>] which are included in our list of critical and
                                    strategic materials and which we wish to procure by purchase
                                    from Peru, it is our judgment that the action imposing an
                                    embargo upon the export thereof should be timed to coincide with
                                    arrangements now under discussion for American purchases of such
                                    commodities. These arrangements will be calculated to afford a
                                    good and a steady market for these Peruvian products <pb n="529"
                                        xml:id="pg_529" facs="0537"/>and thereby prevent such a fall
                                    in prices as might cause criticism and resistance.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>To this end, the Federal Loan Agency is now negotiating with the Cerro de
                            Pasco and Grace Companies for the purpose of appointing these companies
                            as agents of the Federal Loan Agency to buy such of the tungsten ore,
                            vanadium, lead ore, copper ore, zinc ore, bismuth, and antimony which is
                            exported from Peru by companies other than the Cerro de Pasco, the
                            Northern Peru Mining and Smelting Company, and the Vanadium Corporation
                            and is not bought by the United States domestic trade. It is expected
                            that the arrangements with the Cerro de Pasco and Grace Companies will
                            be completed in the near future and it is suggested that it would be a
                            much more satisfactory arrangement to have the export embargo imposed
                            only after notification to you that the contract between the Federal
                            Loan Agency and Cerro de Pasco and Grace Companies has been executed and
                            the latter are prepared to enter the market to buy the embargoed
                            products. It is suggested that you discuss this matter and advise the
                            Finance Minister of this suggestion, the principal purpose of which is
                            of course to prevent embarrassment to him.</p>
                        <p>The products which should be embargoed are those which are mentioned
                            above.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the suggestion in your 215, statistics of the Department
                            of Commerce show that exports of iron and steel products to Peru have
                            been large in the past and are continuing at a substantial rate. The
                            1937–1939 average of shipments of iron and steel products to Peru was
                            28,303 metric tons. 1940 shipments to Peru were 43,197 tons and
                            January–February 1941 shipments total 4,788 tons. These shipments to
                            Peru compare favorably with the shipments to the other Latin American
                            countries. They include a large number of products such as bars, plates,
                            sheets, strip, tin plates, structural steel, rails, pipe, wire and rods,
                            castings and forgings.</p>

                            that reported in our No. 164 of May 8, 9 [<hi rend="italic">5</hi>]

                            satisfactorily cover the reexport situation here. Mr. Dasso expressed
                            the hope that the general export license for Peru would be granted
                            immediately.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Dasso informed us that he felt quite certain that the Peruvian
                            Government would restrict the export of strategic materials to the
                            Western Hemisphere at a time that will coincide with the announcement of
                            the United States plan for the purchase of Peruvian strategic and
                            critical materials.</p>
                        <p>According to the Foreign Minister and the British Legation the Peruvian
                            Government has made a commitment to the British to the effect that
                            molybdenum and tungsten will not be exported beyond the limits of the
                            Western Hemisphere except for prevailing contracts. In this relation
                            please refer to despatches Nos. 1275 and 1278 of June 17, 1941.<note

                        <p>150. Reference your telegram No. 235, June 21, 1 p.m. The Peruvian Decree
                            is very gratifying to the Department.</p>
                        <p>The Department has requested authority from the Administrator of Export
                            Control to issue general licenses to Peru. They will be issued promptly
                            upon receipt of authority and you will be notified accordingly.</p>
                        <p>It is noted that many of the items listed in the Decree are strategic
                            materials of which there is a shortage in this country and it should be
                            pointed out that even if general licenses are issued for these items
                            their exportation will still be subject to priorities.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Mr. Julian D. Smith has been designated by
                            the Federal Loan Agency to act as the special representative in Peru of
                            the Agency and the Metals Reserve Company to negotiate an over-all
                            purchase agreement with Peru. Mr. Smith leaves for Peru by air on July
                            23. He will take with him a draft letter which he has been authorized to
                            sign on behalf of Metals Reserve Company whereby that Company will agree
                            to purchase the total Peruvian exportable surplus of antimony ores,
                            copper ores and concentrates, vanadium ash, and zinc concentrates. A
                            copy of this letter is enclosed.<note n="55" xml:id="d438fn55">Not
                                printed.</note> As you will see, this letter specifies the prices of
                            each commodity, and makes as a condition of the obligation of the Metals
                            Reserve Company the creation of an export control whereby the Peruvian
                            Government will prohibit the export of any of these commodities during
                            the specified period, except to the United States and the other American
                            Republics having parallel systems of export control. The letter limits
                            the amounts of each commodity to the exports of 1940, but the Metals
                            Reserve Company is prepared to increase the amounts to 125 percent of
                            the 1940 exports.</p>
                        <p>Molybdenum, which was one of the materials referred to in the
                            Department’s telegram no. 99 of May 15, has been eliminated. This has
                            been done, with the consent of the Metals Reserve Company, at the
                            request of the British Government, which is now conducting negotiations
                                <pb n="532" xml:id="pg_532" facs="0540"/>for the acquisition of the
                            entire exportable surplus of Peruvian molybdenum. Bismuth, another
                            material referred to in the Department’s no. 99 of May 15, is not
                            included in the draft letter of the Metals Reserve Company. Bismuth was
                            omitted because it is understood that the entire production of Peruvian
                            bismuth is owned by the Cerro de Pasco Company. You are requested to
                            investigate the accuracy of this understanding, for, if it should appear
                            that there is any production of bismuth in Peru which is not owned or
                            effectively controlled by the Cerro de Pasco Company or some other
                            American company, bismuth will be added to the list of materials in the
                            Metals Reserve Company’s letter.</p>
                        <p>It is understood from your telegram no. 235 of June 21 that the Peruvian
                            Government is prepared to restrict the export of strategic materials as
                            soon as an agreement is reached as to the Metals Reserve Company’s plan
                            for the purchase of Peruvian materials. It is assumed that you will
                            assist Mr. Smith in his negotiations for acceptance of the offer to be
                            made by the Metals Reserve Company and that simultaneously you will make
                            arrangements with the Peruvian Government for the issuance of a decree
                            which will prohibit the exportation of the materials covered by the
                            Metals Reserve Company’s offer except to the United States and to such
                            of the other American Republics as have parallel systems of export
                            control satisfactory to the United States. A similar decree has recently
                            been issued by the Mexican Government in connection with the over-all
                            purchase agreement recently concluded between the Federal Loan Agency
                            and the Mexican Government. A copy of the Mexican decree is
                                enclosed.<note n="56" xml:id="d438fn56">Not attached to file copy,
                                but see telegram No. 301, July 11, from the Ambassador in Mexico,

                            will be able to obtain the consent of the Peruvian Government to the
                            issuance of a decree approximating the Mexican form. The products to be
                            subject to the export control should include all the products to be
                            covered by the Metals Reserve Company’s offer and, additionally, if
                            possible, molybdenum.</p>
                        <p>It is suggested that when the negotiations reach that point you telegraph
                            to the Department the form of decree as tentatively agreed upon by the
                            Peruvian authorities and yourself. It is also suggested that you regard
                            the enclosed draft of letter by the Metals Reserve Company to the
                            Peruvian Government as the basic draft and telegraph any proposed
                            changes in it textually. For convenience, the lines in the Metals

                            <p>Given in Government House in Lima this 12th day of August, 1941.

                        </quote>
                        <p>The subject will be discussed in detail with the Finance Minister on
                            August 16. In the meantime attention is called to the fact that there is
                            no time limit on the effective control of the exports concerned and that
                            it may last during the life of the decree. The Minister stated that the
                            question of time limitation to one year was the only point to which
                            objections were raised by other Cabinet members. The Ministers agreed
                            that a decree without limitation is of greater value to both
                            Government[s].</p>

                        <p>It is our opinion that the wording of the letter of agreement to be
                            handed to the Peruvian Government is satisfactory in its present form
                            but that it might be an advantageous precautionary measure to insert the
                            following after the word “embargo” in line 12: “provided the same
                            remains effective during that period.”<note n="59" xml:id="d439fn59">In

                        <p>290. Your August 14, 6 p.m. The August 12 decree extending the scope of
                            Peruvian export control is noted with satisfaction. It should greatly
                            facilitate the negotiations in which Smith is engaged and which we would
                            like to conclude quickly.</p>
                        <p>The Department has requested authority to issue general licenses to Peru
                            on the basis of the Peruvian decrees. The whole problem of general
                            license is being examined by the various agencies of this Government,
                            and although the Department is faced with increasing opposition by other
                            agencies to the issuance of any large number of general licenses, the
                            Department is hopeful that an early solution to this problem can be
                            obtained.</p>
                        <p>It seems desirable to inform the Peruvian authorities that individual
                            applications for licenses are being favorably considered as a result of
                            Peruvian export control regulations, and the fact should be stressed
                            that this Government appreciates the cooperative action shown by the
                            Peruvian Government.</p>

                            being undertaken looking toward the possibility of entering into
                            trade-agreement negotiations with all those American republics with
                            which agreements have not yet been concluded, the Country Committee on
                            Peru is engaged in formulating its recommendations to the Trade
                            Agreements Committee regarding the composition of the list of products
                            on which the United States would consider granting concessions to Peru
                            in the event trade-agreement negotiations should be undertaken. This
                            list would, as you are aware, accompany the public announcement of
                            intention to negotiate a trade agreement and would serve notice that in
                            so far as concessions by the United States are concerned, these would be
                            limited to the articles appearing in the list. It is highly desirable
                            that this list, while not including products on which there <pb n="536"
                                xml:id="pg_536" facs="0544"/>would appear to be no scope for
                            negotiation for various reasons, should include all articles in which
                            the Government of Peru is interested and which offer a reasonable basis
                            for negotiation. Any additions to the list after announcement of
                            intention to negotiate had been issued could, of course, only be made
                            through a further public announcement, a procedure which it is desirable
                            to avoid.</p>
                        <p>The Peruvian Government through its representatives in Washington has
                            submitted to the Department a lengthy list of products on which
                            concessions are desired in a trade agreement. A lack of knowledge in
                            Peru of United States tariff classifications or because Peruvian
                            production or exportation is potential rather than actual in the case of
                            a number of products, has made it difficult on the basis of the list as
                            submitted to the Department to assemble all the data desired on various
                            items. Before making its recommendations to the Trade Agreements
                            Committee, therefore, the Peruvian Country Committee is desirous of
                            securing additional information which it is believed the Embassy may be
                            in a position to supply.</p>
                        <p>There is enclosed a list of the products on which the Government of Peru
                            has requested concessions, which was left with the Department in
                            November, 1940.<note n="64" xml:id="d442fn64">Not printed.</note> There
                            are also enclosed lists of products:<note n="65" xml:id="d442fn65">None
                                printed.</note> which the Country Committee is prepared definitely
                            to recommend to the Trade Agreements Committee for inclusion in a list
                            accompanying any announcement of intention to negotiate with Peru (List
                            A); on which such a recommendation is tentative pending completion of
                            studies by other country committees (List B); which the Country
                            Committee believes should not for various reasons but chiefly because of
                            the probable inability of Peru to produce or export, be included in a
                            published list (List C); and on which further data are needed (List D).
                            The enclosed sheets from the Peruvian Country Committee’s statistical
                            analysis cover the items in List D.</p>
                        <p>While the Embassy’s views are desired particularly regarding List D, any
                            comments which the Embassy may wish to make regarding the items in the
                            other lists or on other items would of course be welcomed. With regard
                            to List D, it would be helpful if the Embassy could supply information
                            particularly as to the future production or export possibilities in Peru
                            of the items mentioned, together with any comment as to the possible
                            value to Peru of duty reductions or bindings on such items, should a
                            decision be made to grant concessions.</p>
                        <p>It would be appreciated if the Embassy’s comments on the foregoing could
                            be submitted at an early date in order that the Country <pb n="537"
                                xml:id="pg_537" facs="0545"/>Committee may be in a position to make
                            its definitive recommendations to the Trade Agreements Committee as soon
                            as possible.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In accordance with the Department’s
                            confidential instruction No. 321 of March 12, 1941, I have the honor to
                            submit the following information and comments on the list of products on
                            which the United States would grant concessions to Peru in the event
                            trade agreement negotiations should be undertaken.</p>
                        <p>The instruction states that it is highly desirable that the list should
                            include all articles in which the government of Peru is interested and
                            which offer a reasonable basis for negotiation; and requests additional
                            information or comments with reference to Lists A, B, C, and D. As
                            concerns List D, details as to future production or export possibilities
                            in Peru are desired, together with any comment as to the possible value
                            of duty reductions or bindings on such items.</p>
                        <p>Observations: Since various analyses of trade statistics have been made
                            by the country committee as well as by the Embassy, they are not
                            repeated here. The observations consist largely of statements with
                            reference to potentialities in case current production is not of
                            commercial importance.</p>
                        <p>List A: The Embassy is in full agreement with the country committee that
                            this list is suitable for inclusion in the public announcement.</p>
                        <p>The list contains raw cotton and sugar, which are and for many years have
                            been the items of paramount interest to Peru. Concessions sufficient to
                            cause the shipment to the United States of a reasonably large volume of
                            these two products would go a long way toward satisfying the desires of
                            Peru and silencing the perennial demands of the most influential group
                            of producers and exporters.</p>
                        <p>Several articles of secondary importance also are included in List A.
                            These are cube, coca leaves, grape brandy, flax, wool (alpaca, llama,
                            and vicuña), cochineal, coffee, tara, furs, guano, leche caspi, rubber,
                            balata, hides and skins, tagua, and mahogany. All of these are products
                            of actual current production and are of interest to numerous producers,
                            not only from the viewpoint of present sales possibilities <pb n="538"
                                xml:id="pg_538" facs="0546"/>but also, in most cases, with reference
                            to future expansion in production, and exportation to the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>All of the minerals listed are of importance to smaller groups of
                            producers.</p>
                        <p>The remaining items are well chosen and their inclusion undoubtedly will
                            be looked upon with satisfaction in Peru owing to the encouragement that
                            concessions on them will give to development and expansion.</p>
                        <p>List B: Cottonseed, oil, cake and meal are important by-products of the
                            cotton industry. Numerous producers are interested in marketing these
                            goods in the United States, and some assistance in this respect would be
                            of indirect assistance to the cotton interests, to whom full
                            satisfaction likely cannot be given as pertains to marketing cotton in
                            the United States. It is believed that these items could well be
                            transferred to List A. It is recalled that practically all of these were
                            marketed formerly in Germany and Denmark.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy knows of no reason why tungsten ore and concentrates should
                            not be included in List A. It is an item in which numerous small
                            producers are interested, and which the Peruvians believe can be
                            produced in substantially greater volume.</p>
                        <p>List C: It is believed that the Peruvians will acquiesce in the omission
                            of many of these items, for the reason (1) that they are not and in the
                            near future likely will not be produced on a competitive basis, even
                            under a preferential United States import tariff; or (2) because of
                            thoroughly reasonable sanitary requirements in the United States; or (3)
                            owing to inadequate domestic production; or (4) because there is no
                            special economic advantage in obtaining a lower United States import
                            tariff (as petroleum).</p>

                            <item>Products falling in this class are earthenware (except perhaps
                                those representing art objects of distinctive Peruvian design),
                                silver leaf, gloves of wool, harness, saddles, luggage and leather
                                articles, and coke.</item>

                            <item>Grapes, raisins, grapefruit, pineapples, melons, quinces, sweet
                                potatoes and yams, and peanuts are affected by reason No. 2 as well
                                as by Nos. 1 and 3.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>It may be mentioned further that, generally speaking, the production and
                            consumption situation in Peru does not warrant the exportation of
                            foodstuffs apart from sugar and coffee. It is believed that the current
                            production of all of the foods in List C is inadequate for serving as
                            the basis for an export business, or even for supplying the domestic
                            demand at popular prices. This is evident from the price legislation and
                            regulations of recent years, and particularly at present; and also from
                            the official requirement that farmers in the most densely populated
                            valley obligatorily devote five to ten percent of the cultivated area to
                            foodstuffs in order to relieve the existing shortage.</p>
                        <pb n="539" xml:id="pg_539" facs="0547"/>
                        <p>There are those who are of the opinion that the Peruvian government
                            should prohibit the exportation of most foodstuffs for the current
                            years, rather than seek concessions which would aggravate the domestic
                            shortage and price situation.</p>
                        <p>Possibly an exception could be made logically in the case of grapes, and
                            it is suggested that consideration be given to the idea of admitting
                            them during the off season in the United States, under the refrigeration
                            system worked out to kill the fruit fly. Such a provision likely would
                            satisfy the official and farm groups desirous of stimulating the grape
                            industry and of rehabilitating vineyards in the lea, Pisco, Moquegua and
                            other valleys in the southern part of Peru.</p>
                        <p>In the case of molybdenum, the United States might wish to consider
                            granting facilities for the relatively small current output of about
                            thirty tons a month, on condition that output be not expanded further,
                            in order to keep this product out of Japan’s war supply.</p>
                        <p>Anthracite coal is only a potential export product, but it is of interest
                            to the government as well as several individuals. They believe this coal
                            could be sold to some extent in the Pacific states. It is improbable
                            that production and exportation in commercial quantities will be
                            possible during the next few years without financial assistance from
                            abroad. A concession on this point would be of value from the political
                            or psychological viewpoint, and in all probability would not originate
                            much competition for American producers. But as in the case of many
                            other Peruvian products, the concession cannot be defended on the
                            premise of previous participation in the trade.</p>
                        <p>Fish scrap and fish meal are potential products in which the Peruvian
                            government is definitely interested. It believes that they represent a
                            possible source of trade with the United States, and that consideration
                            might be given to this matter in view of the difficulty in marketing any
                            substantial amounts of cotton and sugar there. The establishment of a
                            fishing and fish products industry was one of the principal objectives
                            in obtaining the service of the United States fishing experts who are
                            now in Peru.</p>
                        <p>Sterling silver ware, in typical Peruvian designs, is a product which
                            appeals to American travelers and tourists in Peru. Production is and
                            probably will remain small. It is our opinion that a concession in this
                            case should be given further consideration.</p>
                        <p>Mica. Two or three well-known government officials are encouraged by
                            recent inquiries from New York with reference to mica, of which small
                            exports have been effected (10,831 kilos in 1939, of which 8,849 were
                            shipped to Japan, 996 to Ecuador, and 986 to Germany). The product
                            appears to be of minor importance, but nevertheless it may be classed in
                            the group of items of some interest to Peru.</p>
                        <pb n="540" xml:id="pg_540" facs="0548"/>
                        <p>List D: Silver manufactures. Peruvian manufacturing of these wares is
                            very small at present and it is likely that no great expansion will take
                            place in the near future; but the workmanship, designs, and fine content
                            of the articles are attractive to travelers and tourists. Since all of
                            the output is by hand, the relatively small volume that could be
                            produced probably would be marketable in the United States without any
                            inconvenience to American producers. These are among the small number of
                            manufactured commodities which the United States could import from Peru
                            in partial compensation for our heavy sales of manufactures in this
                            country.</p>
                        <p>Watermelons (also muskmelons): The summary of the situation given in the
                            lower right-hand corner of page thirty-nine of the enclosure to
                            instruction No. 321 is correct as pertains to Peru. This fruit is rather
                            expensive and not abundant in the Peruvian market, and it is doubted if
                            a profitable trade with the United States could be built up.
                            Most-favored-nation treatment in this case could be granted for the
                            purpose of meeting Peru’s desires without any fear of burdening the
                            American market.</p>
                        <p>Still wines. Annual production is around 12,000,000 liters and exports
                            have always been insignificant.</p>
                        <p>Quina wine, and coca wine are items of inconsiderable production, but
                            could be developed on a modest scale. It is our opinion that this
                            request could be granted without any inconvenience.</p>
                        <p>Blankets, carpets, mats, rugs, and other manufactures of wool: The
                            principal items are blankets and rugs, of Incaic design.</p>
                        <p>Production statistics are not available, but the total output in mills
                            and by hand labor apparently is too small to meet domestic demands plus
                            orders from abroad, the latter amounting to probably not more than a few
                            hundred units annually. A definite inquiry from San Francisco for one
                            thousand alpaca wool blankets could not be filled, and we have never
                            heard of any important transactions resulting from trade lists supplied
                            by the Embassy to American manufacturers. It is to be mentioned also
                            that representatives of the Grant stores and Gimble’s who visited Peru
                            with the object of purchasing these and other goods for sale in
                            department stores reported no success whatsoever. They found that lots
                            of a few dozen could be assembled; and in the case of rugs were told
                            that the producers are occupied in supplying the domestic demand, which
                            includes sales to tourists and business travelers. This information
                            coincides with the experience of the Embassy in endeavoring to discover
                            sources of supply for American importers who have made inquiries.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, the Peruvians have the materials and the knowledge of
                            weaving, so that these items represent export potentialities. <pb
                                n="541" xml:id="pg_541" facs="0549"/>Tariff concessions might
                            encourage sufficient expansion in the industry to eventually produce a
                            fairly good source of supply for this class of goods.</p>
                        <p>Asbestos manufactures: The statements made on page sixty-eight of the
                            enclosures to instruction No. 321 pertaining to the absence of these

                            knowledge. It would appear that the reductions in the Belgian and
                            British trade agreements, which are applicable to Peru on the m. f. n.
                            basis, would satisfy all of the present necessities of Peru.</p>
                        <p>Embroidered and other leather articles, such as luggage, handbags,
                            pocketbooks, gloves, etc.</p>
                        <p>The observations on <ref target="#pg_70">pages 70</ref>, <ref

                                target="#pg_76">76</ref> of the enclosures, are correct as to the
                            absence of Peru from the list of suppliers to the United States.</p>
                        <p>Again in this case Peru has sufficient leather on which to build a small
                            industry, but it is commonly known that the finer grades of leather have
                            been imported up to the present time, as well as the better grades of
                            leather manufactures, except shoes.</p>
                        <p>It is understood that Peru’s request for a tariff concession on these
                            items originated primarily with Mr. Pedro Diaz, of Arequipa, who during
                            the last few years has developed a small industry and opened retail
                            stores in Arequipa and Lima. The products are good, but according to an
                            American buying agent who visited Peru a few months ago and bought
                            samples of various items and obtained details on others, they cannot
                            compete in price or perfection of finish with the American equivalent in
                            the United States, with the exception of hand embroidered and hand
                            tooled leather. But the number of master workmen is low, and the output
                            of embroidered or tooled articles is insufficient to produce an abundant
                            supply for sale in the stores of Peru.</p>
                        <p>This appears to be another case in which a tariff concession, if granted,
                            would have to be for the purpose of encouraging a source of supply in
                            the western hemisphere.</p>
                        <p>Production figures or even rough estimates for the items appearing in
                            List D are not available, except in the case of wine.</p>
                        <p>Items of interest not included in Mr. Beltran’s list: Ceibo (or kapok).
                            Several Peruvians have stated that this product is available in
                            quantities in Peru; and at least one American firm, the Dry Zero
                            Corporation, of Chicago, has unsuccessfully endeavored to establish
                            purchasing connections.</p>
                        <p>Frozen tuna and fish livers are being sought by American firms and
                            reduced quantities have been collected and shipped by two Peruvian firms
                            during the last two years.</p>
                        <pb n="542" xml:id="pg_542" facs="0550"/>
                        <p>It is possible that the country committee and the Peruvians would like to
                            include these products in List A.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: With a view to improving
                            our trade and other relations with Peru in line with our general policy
                            of promoting hemispheric solidarity by every practicable means, we have
                            been discussing the basis for trade-agreement negotiations with the
                            Peruvian Government.</p>
                        <p>The principal concessions which the United States could be called on to
                            make would be on long-staple cotton and sugar. With respect to the
                            former, we contemplate the possibility of granting the concession on a
                            customs-quota basis which, without necessarily involving any increase in
                            our total imports, would enable Peru to supply at least a part of the
                            deficiency in supplies from Egypt which may be expected as a result of
                            the war. Incidentally, the fact that Japan has been buying large
                            quantities of Peruvian cotton, and the possibility that some of it is
                            reaching Germany, gives particular significance to any move we may make
                            at the present time to facilitate imports of this product into the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>We have also had under consideration the negotiation of a supplementary
                            agreement with Cuba<note n="66" xml:id="d444fn66">See <ref
                                    target="#pg_227">pp. 227</ref> ff.</note> under which we might
                            reduce the rate on Cuban sugar from the present rate of .9 cent to .75
                            cent per pound. If it should be decided to enter into such negotiations
                            prior to the negotiation of an agreement with Peru, it would be possible
                            to reduce the full duty rate on Peruvian sugar by the full amount
                            permitted by the law, i. e., to .9375 cent per pound; otherwise, in
                            order not to reduce the duty on Cuban sugar indirectly, the full-duty
                            rate would not be reduced below 1.125 cent per pound. Our plan is to
                            take up the question of negotiating a trade agreement with Peru and to
                            seek to establish a basis for announcing publicly such negotiations. The
                            exact timing of such announcement would be left open for consideration
                            after a basis for negotiations shall have been reached.</p>
                        <p>I should appreciate being informed whether the foregoing meets with your
                                approval.<note n="67" xml:id="d444fn67">Original letter returned by

                        <p>Reference is made to recent conversations held between representatives of
                            the Governments of the United States and Peru looking toward the
                            establishment of a basis for the negotiation of a trade agreement.</p>
                        <p>These conversations have disclosed the mutual belief that a sufficient
                            basis would have been established for public announcement to be made of
                            intention to negotiate a trade agreement between the United States and
                            Peru if agreement were to be reached on the points discussed hereafter.
                            When such a basis shall have been established, the question of when the
                            proposed negotiations should be publicly announced will be given
                            consideration.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the list of products upon which the Government of the
                            United States might grant concessions to Peru, which is appended
                                hereto,<note n="69" xml:id="d445fn69">Not printed.</note> the
                            Government of the United States would consider, subject to possible
                            modification in the light of information obtained following public
                            notice of intention to negotiate a trade agreement with Peru, a
                            reduction of 50 percent (the maximum permitted under the authority of
                            the Trade Agreements Act<note n="70" xml:id="d445fn70">Approved June 12,
                                1934; 48 Stat. 943.</note>) in the present rate of duty on
                            long-staple cotton one and one-eighth inches and over in staple length,
                            such a reduction to be applicable to an amount of such cotton
                            approximately equal to the total volume of long-staple cotton at present
                            permitted to enter the United States under the existing absolute quotas
                            on that product (45,656,420 pounds). The Government of the United States
                            has in view in this connection the removal of the present quotas
                            simultaneously with the effective date of the trade agreement with Peru.
                            Under such an arrangement it would be proposed that the tariff quota be
                            unallocated, that is, there would be no restrictions upon the amount of
                            cotton which might be imported from individual countries at the reduced
                            rate of duty up to the full amount of the quota. If at a later date the
                            Government of Peru should desire a specific allocation, the Government
                            of the United States would give sympathetic consideration to a request
                            along such lines. The Government of the United States is not in a
                            position at this time to indicate what the agreement might provide in
                            respect of the rate of duty applicable to imports in excess of the
                            suggested tariff quota.</p>

                        <p>With respect to sugar, the Government of the United States would be
                            prepared to consider at this time, subject to possible modification in
                            the light of information obtained following public notice of intention
                            to negotiate a trade agreement with Peru, a reduction of 75 cents per
                            hundred pounds of standard raw sugar (to $1.125 per hundred pounds), in
                            the rate of duty applicable to imports from Peru. The Government of the
                            United States is unable to offer the Government of Peru any assurances
                            as to the amount of Peruvian sugar which might be permitted to enter the
                            United States in any year as this is a matter determined at present by
                            the Sugar Act of 1937,<note n="71" xml:id="d445fn71">Approved September
                                1, 1937; 50 Stat. 903.</note> the provisions of which are not
                            subject to modification under the authority to negotiate agreements
                            conferred on the Executive by the Trade Agreements Act. The Government
                            of the United States would be willing, however, to consider the
                            inclusion in the proposed agreement of a provision whereby the
                            Government of Peru would have the right, to be exercised within a
                            specified period following the close of each sugar control year, to
                            terminate the entire agreement if in the previous control year the
                            amount of Peruvian sugar permitted to be imported into the United States
                            had been altered substantially to the disadvantage of Peru. Any
                            reduction in duty would be made dependent upon the continuance of the
                            Sugar Act of 1937 or similar legislation.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the other items appearing in the appended list, the
                            Government of the United States is unable to indicate at present the
                            extent of the concessions which might be offered but would consider
                            granting the most liberal treatment possible in the light of information
                            which may be developed following public notice of intention to negotiate
                            an agreement with Peru.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the concessions which the Government of the United States
                            would request the Peruvian Government to grant on products of this
                            country, a list of which will be submitted at a later date, the
                            Government of the United States considers that a sufficient basis for
                            negotiations will have been established if the Government of Peru would
                            agree to give sympathetic consideration to granting as liberal
                            concessions as possible on the products in that list in the light of the
                            concessions offered by the United States.</p>
                        <p>Regarding the general provisions of the proposed agreement, a suggested
                            draft of which is attached,<note n="72" xml:id="d445fn72">Not
                                printed.</note> it would appear, on the basis of preliminary
                            conversations, that serious problems of negotiation are likely to arise
                            only on the question of the exceptions to unconditional
                            most-favored-nation treatment requested by the Government of Peru in
                            connection with trade with contiguous countries. If agreement <pb
                                n="545" xml:id="pg_545" facs="0553"/>were to be reached on this
                            point at this time, therefore, as well as on those discussed above, it
                            is believed that a basis would have been established for proceeding with
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>As the Government of Peru is aware, the Government of the United States
                            attaches great importance to the principle of unconditional
                            most-favored-nation treatment. It would be extremely reluctant,
                            therefore, under ordinary circumstances, to agree to exceptions such as
                            those which have been indicated by the Government of Peru. The
                            Government of the United States has a full realization, however, that
                            unusual conditions prevail at the present time, and is mindful, also, of
                            the provisions of Resolution LXXX of the Seventh International
                            Conference of American States, Montevideo, 1933,<note n="73"

                                    eliminate the customs duties on like imports from other
                                    countries; and any such regional tariff preferences should not
                                    be permitted to stand in the way of any broad program of
                                    economic reconstruction involving the reduction of tariffs and
                                    the scaling down or elimination of tariff and other trade
                                    preferences with a view to the fullest possible development of

                                    question of modifying any existing preference which fails to
                                    meet the requirements of the contractual formula outlined above
                                    or which, even if it does meet such requirements, has resulted
                                    in substantial injury to United States exports to Peru of the
                                    product or products concerned. The Peruvian Government would, of
                                    course, be expected to give careful and sympathetic
                                    consideration to any proposals of the Government of the United
                                    States in regard to any such preference. If, however, the two
                                    Governments should fail to agree in regard to any such proposal,
                                    the Government of the United States would be free to suspend or
                                    terminate the agreement in whole or in part on thirty days’

                        <p>With respect to the question of increasing the existing preferences or of
                            adding new preferences, the Government of Peru would agree to consult in
                            advance with the Government of the United States before taking any
                            action thereon. The Government of the United States would consider the
                            proposed action carefully and sympathetically in the light of the
                            contractual formula described above and of the probable effects of the
                            proposed action on United States exports to Peru of the product or
                            products concerned. If, after consultation, the Government of the United
                            States should object to the proposed action, the Government of Peru
                            would, nevertheless, be free to take the action proposed. However, if
                            such action were taken, the Government of the United States would be
                            free to suspend or terminate the agreement in whole or in part on thirty

                        <p>It would be appreciated if the Government of Peru would indicate whether
                            it agrees with the proposals set forth above.</p>

                        <p>Señor Chavez called, upon request, to receive formally the Department’s
                            proposals in connection with the possibility of negotiating a <pb
                                n="547" xml:id="pg_547" facs="0555"/>trade agreement with Peru.
                            There was a discussion of the principal points covered in the proposals,
                            in connection with which Señor Chavez raised a question about the
                            omission from the list of products on which the United States would
                            consider granting concessions to Peru, of certain items which had
                            appeared on the Peruvian request list presented to the Department in
                            November 1940. It was explained to Señor Chavez that we had made every
                            effort to include in the list all the items of real or potential
                            importance to Peru, but if after considering the list, the Peruvian
                            Government desired that consideration be given to certain additional
                            products, we would be glad to study these again.</p>
                        <p>Señor Chavez said that he would transmit the Department’s proposals to
                            his Government at once and would get in touch with us as soon as he
                            received a reply from Lima.</p>
                        <p>It was made clear to Señor Chavez that, as was mentioned in the
                            proposals, the question of the timing of a public announcement of
                            negotiations with Peru was one which would be decided after agreement
                            had been reached between the two Governments on the basis for
                            negotiations, and in the meantime the Department’s proposals should be
                            held in strict confidence.</p>

                            appreciate your views as to whether or not it might be good policy for
                            us to reopen this question.</p>
                        <p>Peruvian action with respect to the attack of Japan against the United
                            States has been favorable. … An initiative from us in the matter of the
                            trade agreement might consolidate our improved position in Peru.</p>

                                26<note n="2" xml:id="d449fn2">Not printed.</note> has been somewhat
                            delayed, as I wished to give you the latest information on the situation
                            affecting Uruguay’s request for armaments.</p>
                        <p>I can assure you that this matter is in no manner escaping our attention.
                            It forms a part of a larger problem: how the United States can arm
                            itself rapidly and at the same time furnish supplies to Great Britain,
                            China, Greece, and the American countries. In order to obtain an
                            adequate concept of the situation in so far as it affects the American
                            republics we are now, with the help of the War and Navy Departments,
                            considering all the requests for arms and munitions which these
                            countries have submitted in order to estimate the most urgent needs of
                            each country, our capacity for meeting them and the financial problems
                            involved. It was to facilitate this that we asked you to request the
                            Uruguayan Government to submit officially its request for war matériel
                            in the form described in the circular instruction of September 25,
                                1940.<note n="2a" xml:id="d449fn2a"><ref target="frus1940v05#pg_13"

                            connection that programs or schedules are being drawn up for each

                            estimated financial requirements. As we informed the Uruguayan Minister
                            in Washington,<note n="3" xml:id="d449fn3">José Richling.</note>
                            Uruguay’s need for a loan to effect armament purchases is being
                            considered in connection with this program.</p>
                        <p>When you have a convenient occasion to mention this subject to Dr.

                            we are keeping Uruguay’s request constantly in mind and shall not fail

                        <p>You may be interested to hear that Señor Richling transmitted to us
                            several weeks ago official copies of the list of war matériel, compiled
                            according to our circular of September 25 and forwarded to him by the
                            Uruguayan Government. These are now under consideration in connection
                            with the plan described above.</p>

                                xml:id="d450fn6">Gen. J. A. Roletti.</note> to say that the latter
                            wishes to inquire whether it would be agreeable to the United States
                            Government to receive the visit of two missions of Uruguayan military
                            officers.</p>
                        <p>One mission would be composed of 3 artillery officers, a colonel, a major
                            and a captain who would visit the United States in order to study the
                            question of purchase of armaments with officers of the United States
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>The second mission would be composed of 5 aviation officers, a lieutenant
                            colonel, a captain and 3 other officers. Their purpose would be to study
                            the question of purchase of aviation material, and in addition it is
                            desired that the captain take flying courses at Randolph Field and other
                            schools and that the 3 junior officers take a technical course in
                            maintenance at the air corps technical school at Chanute, Rantoul,

                        <p>281. The Minister of Foreign Affairs advises me that the Uruguayan
                            Aviation Purchasing Commission now in the United States has been
                            informed by the American companies that they are prepared to supply
                            aviation material urgently needed here but that the mission and the
                            Ministry of National Defense do not have information as to the means of
                            obtaining credits under the proposed Export-Import Bank loan for the
                            purchase of this material.</p>
                        <p>I have given a résumé of the essential portions of the Department’s

                        <p>156. Your 281, July 3, 4 p.m. The Department on July 8 handed to the
                            Uruguayan Minister a draft of basic agreement for the lend-lease program
                            of transferring military matériel to Uruguay. The principal financial
                            provisions are as follows: Uruguay is to receive a total of $17,000,000
                            of war and navy materiél of which it is expected $2,000,000 of army
                            matériel and $1,000,000 of navy matériel will be transferred during the
                            fiscal year ending June 30, 1942. This delivery date is subject to
                            change if broad defense considerations so require.</p>
                        <p>With respect to repayment, Uruguay is expected to pay $1,300,000 in each
                            fiscal year until 1947, making a total of $7,800,000 to be repaid prior
                            to June 30, 1947. In consideration of the broad objectives of the
                            program and of certain very general economic concepts, the entire
                            obligation of Uruguay to the United States would be considered
                            discharged by such payments.</p>
                        <p>The Minister stated that he believed that Uruguay would not need the full
                            $17,000,000 originally provided for, and that he would request his
                            military expert to prepare a list which would probably amount to
                            $6,000,000 or $7,000,000. He was informed that of course the United
                            States did not wish to force additional arms upon Uruguay, and that the
                            matter could be further discussed. In reply to his question, he was
                            informed that the amounts to be repaid were based on an appraisal of
                            Uruguay’s economic outlook; that they were in no way proportionate to
                            the amount of arms to be furnished, which was based purely on defense
                            and strategic considerations; and that if the total were reduced
                            markedly, the repayment proportions would undoubtedly be increased
                            proportionately.</p>
                        <p>The Minister stated that he fully understood the situation, indicated his
                            gratification at the generous treatment to be accorded Uruguay, and
                            stated that he would inform his government in general terms only, not
                            transmitting any figures until he had taken up with the Department a
                            specific list of arms in the much lower total amount.</p>

                            with him and the Minister of National Defense at the Foreign Office. The
                            following points were brought out at the conference which was attended

                                which there remains available a balance of 6,300,000 pesos which
                                should at official exchange rates take care of 2 or 3 annual

                            attention of the Uruguayan Minister that the Minister of National
                            Defense had stated that Uruguay would require the full $17,000,000 for
                            needed material. The Minister had previously suggested a figure of
                            $5,000,000 but he has now indicated that he will send the texts in
                            Spanish and English on the $17,000,000 basis to his Government by

                        <p>357. My telegram No. 317, July 23, and Department’s telegram No. 181,
                            July 26, concerning Lend-Lease program for transferring military
                            matériel to Uruguay. Our proposal has now been favorably considered by
                            the Uruguayan Government and Guani tells me that at a Cabinet meeting
                            yesterday he was charged with drafting of a message to Congress
                            requesting its authorization to conclude the proposed agreement. He says
                            that the matter must be submitted to Congress and that the normal
                            procedure would be to publish both the message and the text of the
                            agreement. I have asked him to withhold publication until I can consult
                            the Department with regard to its wishes.</p>
                        <p>The matter has received already some publicity here. In particular a
                            press despatch concerning yesterday’s meeting of the Cabinet contains
                            the brief statement that it was decided to request Congressional
                            permission for an agreement under which Uruguay would acquire war
                            material in the amount of $17,000,000. One of the minor local newspapers
                            has referred to negotiations under which Uruguay would pay less than
                            half of the value of the material to be acquired.</p>
                        <p>It is obvious that once the matter is laid before Congress the terms of
                            the proposed agreement will become pretty generally known even if the
                            Government’s message were not published and Congressional discussion
                            were to be in secret session. Since we cannot expect the secret to be
                            properly guarded and any attempt to maintain secrecy is apt to arouse
                            suspicion here and in Buenos Aires and, bearing in mind our previous
                            experience in connection with Congressional discussion of the naval base
                            issue, I am inclined to believe that the best course is full publicity
                            and open debate. I shall appreciate the Department’s prompt instructions
                            for communication to Guani at the earliest possible moment.</p>

                        <p>208. Your 357 August 20, 6 p.m. In view of the fact that the financial
                            terms vary from country to country the Department would not welcome
                            publication of the various texts which would permit comparison <pb
                                n="555" xml:id="pg_555" facs="0563"/>of the financial terms offered
                            the several American republics. Nevertheless, if the proper Uruguayan
                            procedure requires a general congressional discussion of the matter, and
                            since the secret cannot be properly guarded, the Department authorizes
                            you in your discretion to agree to the publication of the text of the

                            which contains no changes of substance, but a number of modifications of

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to my despatch
                            No. 112 of September 4, 1941,<note n="12" xml:id="d458fn12">Not
                                printed.</note> and to previous correspondence regarding the
                            proposed transfer of military matériel to Uruguay under the Lend-Lease
                            program.</p>
                        <p>The only new development in the matter since my last despatch has been an
                            interview which Mr. Chapin and I had on September 5 at the Foreign
                            Office with the Ministers of Foreign Relations, National Defense, and
                                Finance.<note n="13" xml:id="d458fn13">Javier Mendivil.</note> The
                            conference was arranged at Dr. Guani’s request for the purpose of
                            discussing certain points in the Department’s draft of the proposed
                            agreement which were not quite clear to the Uruguayan officials.</p>
                        <p>The only point of any importance concerning which they desired
                            information was the amount of matériel which Uruguay would receive
                            during the first twelve months. It developed in the course of the
                            conversation that, since Uruguay was to be called upon to pay only
                            $1,300,000 per annum, certain members of the Cabinet feared that this
                            meant that matériel to be delivered during the twelve-month period would
                            not exceed this amount. Mr. Chapin and I dispelled their doubts on this
                            score and pointed out that, as I had previously informed Dr. Guani and
                            as he was presumably advised by his representative in Washington, the
                            Department had expressly stated that it was expected that $2,000,000 of
                            army matériel and $1,000,000 of <pb n="556" xml:id="pg_556" facs="0564"
                            />navy matériel would be transferred to Uruguay during the first twelve
                            months.</p>
                        <p>The Minister of National Defense said that while he was glad to know that
                            the delivery of matériel amounting to $3,000,000 was contemplated during
                            the coming twelve months, even this amount was substantially below
                            Uruguay’s immediate requirements which were estimated at $5,000,000. He
                            said that he was afraid that opposition in Congress would center around
                            this point and that the Government’s position would be much stronger if
                            it appeared that Uruguay would receive promptly the
                            matériel—particularly training planes—which the Government has stated to
                            be urgently required for defense. Mr. Chapin and I told General Roletti
                            and his colleagues that, while we were confident that our Government
                            would do everything practicable to meet Uruguay’s needs, deliveries
                            would have to be governed largely by production and our own
                            requirements. Mr. Chapin pointed out that the filling of Uruguay’s needs
                            might be facilitated to some extent if, in specifying items required,
                            some latitude were left for the substitution of matériel which we might
                            not be able to furnish promptly owing to other urgent defense
                            demands.</p>
                        <p>After some further discussion, General Roletti said that it might be
                            found possible to amend Article 1 so as to provide for deliveries
                            totalling $5,000,000 during the fifteen months following the signing of
                            the agreement. He said that he would consider such a provision
                            satisfactory and believed that it would satisfy the Uruguayan Congress.
                            Dr. Guani intimated that instructions might be sent to the Uruguayan
                            Ambassador in Washington to suggest such a change to the Department.
                            Whether or not such instructions have been or will be sent, I do not
                            know.</p>
                        <p>With reference to my telegram No. 357 of August 20 and the Department’s
                            telegram No. 208 of August 22, concerning publication of the proposed
                            agreement, I may say that in the course of our interview on September 5,
                            Dr. Guani stated that he no longer considered it advisable to publish
                            the full text of the agreement in submitting the matter to Congress,
                            since he had reached the conclusion that the wording of certain clauses
                            might be misunderstood by the public. He said, however, that the
                            Government’s message to Congress would be published and would contain a
                            summary of the agreement setting forth the principal provisions
                            including, of course, the financial conditions. Mr. Chapin and I both
                            feel that publication of this information is inevitable and desirable
                            and that any attempt to maintain secrecy regarding a matter which cannot
                            be kept secret would arouse suspicion and have unfortunate
                            repercussions. I suggested to Dr. Guani that he might like to let me see
                            the text of the message to Congress before it was actually sent and he
                            said that he would do so. I made this suggestion because of my desire to
                            be in a position, if <pb n="557" xml:id="pg_557" facs="0565"/>possible,
                            to clear up any misunderstanding which may still linger in the minds of
                            the Cabinet before the message goes to Congress. In spite of my previous
                            conversations with Dr. Guani and my efforts to make all phases of the
                            proposed agreement clear both to him (and to the President), I was
                            surprised to find that, at the beginning of our recent interview, he was
                            still in doubt as to so important a point as that referred to above.</p>

                        <p>392. The Uruguayan Government sent yesterday to Congress a message
                            urgently requesting authority to sign our proposed agreement for the
                            delivery of war material under the lease-lend program. The message has
                            been published but not the text of the agreement. The message sets forth
                            the financial terms offered by us, states that they are exceptionally
                            advantageous and that our offer should be accepted promptly, and points
                            out that of the $7,800,000 which Uruguay would pay for $17,000,000 worth
                            of material about $4,000,000 would be covered from proceeds of the
                            national defense loan authorized last year. Text of message follows by
                            air mail.</p>

                            approval by the Chamber of Deputies is still pending in the Senate.
                            While it has not come up for discussion the Herreristas<note n="15"
                                xml:id="d460fn15">Followers of Luis Alberto de Herrera, five-time
                                candidate of the Partido Nacional for the Presidency of
                                Uruguay.</note> have announced that they will oppose it and are
                            doing so violently in their organ <hi rend="italic">El Debate</hi>.</p>
                        <p>The financial clauses were summarized in the Government’s message to
                            Congress which accompanied my despatch number 248. Publication of the
                            full text of the agreement had not been considered advisable by Guani.
                            However, <hi rend="italic">El Debate</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Tribuna
                                Popular</hi> which is likewise unfriendly to the United States have
                            now published the <pb n="558" xml:id="pg_558" facs="0566"/>full text and
                            claim that it contains provisions prejudicial to Uruguay. In particular
                            they have seized upon the clauses providing for the furnishing of
                            defense information and for suspension by the United States of
                            deliveries at our option.</p>
                        <p>Guani tells me that he did not authorize publication and that he believes
                            that <hi rend="italic">El Debate</hi> obtained the text from some
                            Herrerista member of Congress who copied it in Committee. While he is
                            extremely annoyed with the Herreristas he says that from an
                            international standpoint too much importance should not be attached to
                            their attitude which he ascribed primarily to their desire of
                            embarrassing the Government and of bringing pressure on it for domestic
                            political reasons. While I believe the Herreristas interested
                            principally in the domestic situation it is worthy of note that there
                            has been a marked recrudescence of hostility to the United States on
                            their part during the past few days coinciding with increased world
                            tension and following a visit of three Herrerista members of Congress to
                            Buenos Aires to attend a banquet for Admiral Scassox.</p>

                        <p>54. 1. Public announcement of intention to negotiate a trade agreement
                            with Argentina seems possible in the near future.<note n="16"

                            desirable to undertake negotiations with Uruguay concurrently, and you
                            are requested to ascertain as soon as possible whether, in the event
                            that a satisfactory basis for undertaking negotiations with Argentina is
                            reached, the Uruguayan Government would be disposed to undertake the
                            negotiation of a trade agreement generally along the lines of that
                            contemplated in 1939.<note n="17" xml:id="d461fn17">See <ref

                        <p>2. You should state that the list of products in respect of which we
                            would be prepared to consider granting concessions to Uruguay, to be
                            published with the public announcement of intention to negotiate, would
                            include those with respect to which we offered concessions during the
                            previous negotiations. However, we would be prepared to consider the
                            possibility of adding to the published list other products of major
                            interest to Uruguay which the Uruguayan Government might wish to
                            propose.</p>
                        <pb n="559" xml:id="pg_559" facs="0567"/>
                        <p>3. While we would desire that the general provisions be basically similar
                            to those proposed by us during the previous negotiations, account would
                            be taken of abnormal circumstances arising from the war.</p>
                        <p>4. In communicating the foregoing to the Foreign Office, you should state
                            that an early reply would be greatly appreciated. You should also
                            emphasize that it is essential that there be no publicity whatever in
                            the matter prior to public announcement.</p>
                        <p>5. The Uruguayan Minister<note n="18" xml:id="d461fn18">José
                                Richling.</note> here is being informed of the foregoing.</p>
                        <p>6. It is suggested that you communicate discreetly with the Embassy at
                            Buenos Aires in order to obtain additional information regarding the
                            discussions now in progress with the Argentine Government.</p>
                        <p>7. For your background information, we are also instructing the Legation
                            at Asunción to ascertain whether the Paraguayan Government would be
                            disposed to undertake the negotiation of a trade agreement at this
                            time.</p>

                        <p>141. Department’s telegram 54, April 3, 6 p.m. I left with the Foreign
                            Minister today a strictly confidential note embodying the substance of
                            the first four paragraphs of the Department’s telegram.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Guani<note n="19" xml:id="d462fn19">Alberto Guani, Uruguayan Minister
                                for Foreign Affairs.</note> said that the Uruguayan Government
                            “would be only too glad to resume negotiations for a trade agreement
                            with the United States upon the general bases tentatively established in
                            the previous negotiations which had been dropped at the instance of the
                            United States.” He said that I might take his oral statement as the
                            official answer of the Uruguayan Government. He added that the United
                            States Government could rest assured that the matter would be kept a
                            close secret and that as far as Uruguay was concerned “there would be no
                            publicity in the matter prior to public announcement.”</p>

                        <p>163. Department’s 54, April 3, 6 p.m. From the information which
                                Adam<note n="20" xml:id="d463fn20">Hector C. Adam, Jr., Third
                                Secretary of Embassy.</note> brought back from Buenos Aires it would
                            appear that the conditions surrounding a possible trade agreement differ
                            considerably between Uruguay and Argentina since in the last year we
                            have become Uruguay’s best customer with a strong balance of trade in
                            Uruguay’s favor and are thus in an excellent bargaining position.</p>
                        <p>Glover<note n="21" xml:id="d463fn21">Robert G. Glover, Commercial
                                Attaché.</note> and I feel strongly that the proposed negotiations
                            for a trade agreement with Uruguay should be undertaken as soon as
                            possible so that the announcement of intention to negotiate with
                            Argentina and Uruguay may be issued at the same time.</p>
                        <p>Since there is little in the way of original concessions which might be
                            given Uruguay above those given to Argentina, premature announcement of
                            our possible concessions to Argentina might seriously prejudice any
                            Uruguayan agreement.</p>
                        <p>In my last conversation with Guani he also expressed the hope that from
                            the point of view of local reaction we would not wait until the
                            Argentine agreement was practically completed before starting
                            negotiations here but that negotiations might be begun immediately.</p>
                        <p>It is assumed that the Department will advise the Legation as soon as
                            possible of the nature of the new general provisions for the Uruguayan
                            agreement and for any modifications proposed in schedules I and II, but
                            in our opinion the most important single factor with respect to
                            Uruguayan concessions would be a provision for most-favored-nation
                            treatment with regard to exchange. If American goods were granted the
                            same exchange treatment as those coming from Great Britain, duty
                            reductions in comparatively few items would seem necessary.</p>

                            of April 22—6 p.m., and in view of the advanced state of discussions
                            between the United States and Argentina, which are now being conducted
                            in Buenos <pb n="561" xml:id="pg_561" facs="0569"/>Aires, I have the
                            honor to submit the following considerations with respect to the
                            advisability of commencing trade agreement negotiations with Uruguay at
                            the earliest opportunity. The Legation feels that the situation in
                            Uruguay differs from that in Argentina in two important respects: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>The President of Uruguay does not have the power to conclude
                                    an agreement without the prior approval by both Houses of the
                                    Legislature. The Department is already aware of the peculiar
                                    situation in the Uruguayan Legislature whereby the Herrerista
                                        group<note n="22" xml:id="d464fn22">Followers of Luis
                                        Alberto de Herrera, five-time candidate of the Partido
                                        Nacional for the Presidency of Uruguay.</note> is in a
                                    position to block any legislative measure which it may choose.
                                    The situation suggests to the Legation that some difficulty
                                    might be encountered in obtaining ratification of the trade
                                    agreement, although I was recently assured by Uruguayan Minister
                                    for Foreign Affairs that he did not expect trouble on that
                                    score. In spite of Dr. Guani’s assurances, it would appear that
                                    the best way to avoid difficulties with the Legislature is to
                                    commence negotiations immediately, as even Dr. Guani hinted that
                                    public announcement of the proposed agreement with Argentina
                                    before the conclusion of negotiations here might seriously
                                    disturb Legislative action. The Department will readily
                                    appreciate that the Herrerista Nationalists would be only too
                                    glad, as a means of embarrassing the Administration, to show
                                    their colleagues that Uruguay, by failing to conclude the
                                    agreement, would reap all the benefits obtained by Argentina
                                    without having to give anything in return.</item>

                                <item>The United States’ position vis-à-vis Uruguay is far stronger
                                    than it is with respect to Argentina, and the chances of
                                    obtaining a trade agreement satisfactory to the United States
                                    exporters are correspondingly better; while Argentina’s balance
                                    of trade with the United States is unfavorable, Uruguay’s
                                    balance is distinctly favorable. For example, the United States
                                    has bought approximately ninety percent of Uruguay’s current
                                    wool clip; during the first three months of 1941, Consular
                                    invoices on file in this office show the United States purchased
                                    $15,814,035. worth of Uruguay’s produce, while it is estimated
                                    that sales to Uruguay in the same period amounted to well under
                                    $4,000,000.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>The United States Department of Commerce figures for January–February,
                            1941, show $11,854,000. purchased against $1,736,000. sold. As related
                            in the Commercial Attaché’s annual report, the Bank of the Republic,
                            during 1940, purchased exchange arising from exports in the sum of
                            $66,829,127. against estimated sales of $36,000,000., leaving a balance
                            for the year of $30,000,000.</p>
                        <p>It thus becomes abundantly clear that the United States could, if it
                            received a more equitable exchange treatment, sell a far larger <pb
                                n="562" xml:id="pg_562" facs="0570"/>amount to Uruguay than it does
                            at present without having to increase its Uruguayan imports. The
                            Legation is, therefore, of the opinion that our principal objective in
                            concluding a trade agreement with Uruguay should be to obtain a larger
                            share of the exchange which is created by our imports of Uruguayan
                            produce.</p>
                        <p>If, for reasons of policy, the Department feels that it is desirable to
                            permit Great Britain and the “sterling area” in general to obtain a
                            larger share of the total available controlled exchange than their
                            purchases create in Uruguay, it would still seem possible under the
                            arrangement suggested in the paragraph above to release some of the
                            exchange created by our imports to the sterling countries. Such a course
                            seems preferable to the present exchange situation where sterling
                            exports to Uruguay enjoy favorable exchange rates as compared to our own
                            exports as a matter of right, and where our own exports are subject to
                            varying discrimination dependent in degree purely upon the arbitrary
                            decision of the Uruguayan authorities. A trade agreement in this form
                            would seem to afford maximum protection to United States business, while
                            not tying our hands in case we should wish to make some of our exchange
                            available to “sterling area” countries.</p>
                        <p>So important does this matter of receiving equitable exchange treatment
                            appear to the Legation that it feels reduction of Uruguayan tariff items
                            by comparison of no real importance for the duration of the war.</p>
                        <p>The Legation’s principal interest in regard to the Uruguayan import
                            tariff is the reduction of certain excessive gold surcharges which at
                            the present time affect certain articles which form an important share
                            of our exports to Uruguay, and which are considered the world over to be
                            American export specialities. However, though the Legation feels that
                            present conditions render it unnecessary to ask for much in the way of
                            actual tariff reductions, the Legation does consider it advisable that
                            all important American export items be bound at the present tariff
                            rates. If the importer of all categories of American goods could, at the
                            conclusion of this trade agreement, be assured of receiving imports from
                            the United States by paying for them at the same controlled rates of
                            exchange as do the importers of goods from the most favored nation, the
                            Legation has every reason to believe that United States exporters would
                            find themselves in a strongly commanding position in the Uruguayan
                            market. Thus, in essence, what the Legation wishes to obtain is
                            most-favored-nation treatment with respect both to duties and exchange
                            for every class of articles exported from the United States.</p>
                        <p>It is possible that the questions of a more generous allotment of
                            ocean-going cargo space for Uruguayan exports and of our existing <pb
                                n="563" xml:id="pg_563" facs="0571"/>export license system of
                            strategic materials and products which are necessary to Uruguay’s
                            economic life may be brought up in the trade agreement discussions. Dr.
                            Guani has mentioned the subject of cargo space on several occasions, and
                            it is believed he is now under pressure from local importers for aid in
                            obtaining export permits for strategic articles such as aluminum.
                            Although, undoubtedly, outside the scope of the usual considerations in
                            trade agreement discussions, they are vital questions from the Uruguayan
                            point of view.</p>
                        <p>In the light of the Department’s strictly confidential mimeographed
                            instruction of April 1, 1941 (File No. 811.20 (D)
                                Regulations/1729a),<note n="24" xml:id="d464fn24"><ref

                                    p. 151</ref>.</note> concerning the control of exports by the
                            United States of strategic raw materials and the Department’s desire
                            that they not be re-exported by American purchasing countries, it is
                            possible that the Department might wish to suggest the inclusion in a
                            trade agreement of suitable provisions prohibiting such re-exports by
                            Uruguay as a part of the general provisions.</p>
                        <p>In discussing with members of the Embassy staff in Buenos Aires the
                            progress of the trade agreement negotiations there, Mr. Adam learned
                            that the provision with respect to nominal custom penalties and clerical
                            errors in invoice manifests, etc. was causing difficulty. He also
                            recalls that this subject, although one of apparently minor importance
                            from the United States’ point of view, was one of the first objected to
                            by the Uruguayan conferees in the previous negotiations and to which the
                            objection was most emphatic. Mr. Silveira Zorzi<note n="25"
                                xml:id="d464fn25">Of the Bank of the Republic of Uruguay.</note>
                            held that basic Uruguayan law did not permit taking into consideration a
                            declarant’s intent, and that penalties had to be assessed on the printed
                            document exactly as presented. It is believed that unnecessary
                            discussion will be avoided if the Department is willing to forego the
                            article of the general provisions dealing with this subject.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, it is not without interest to report that occasional
                            articles have recently appeared in the more responsible Uruguayan
                            newspapers, urging the cultivation of closer trade relations with the
                            United States. A clipping of an editorial from this morning’s edition of
                                <hi rend="italic">La Mañana</hi>, semi-official Government organ, is
                            enclosed as a typical example.<note n="26" xml:id="d464fn26">Not
                                printed.</note> While the article itself contributes little in the
                            way of constructive suggestions, it is added evidence that announcement
                            of negotiations for a trade agreement would be well received by public
                            opinion at this time.</p>

                            confidential use in discussions with Uruguayan authorities, there is a
                            possibility that trade-agreement discussions now taking place with
                            Argentina may reach a point which will make possible public announcement
                            of intended negotiations in the very near future, possibly <pb n="565"
                                xml:id="pg_565" facs="0573"/>as early as May 10. We will, of course,
                            wish to announce negotiations with Uruguay simultaneously. Before this
                            can be done it is necessary that the list of products for consideration
                            to be published with the announcement be definitely agreed upon. Please
                            discuss the matter promptly in the above sense with the appropriate
                            Uruguayan authorities with a view to obtaining their acquiescence to the
                            list communicated to you in reference telegram.</p>

                        <p>176. Department’s No. 74, May 7, 10 p.m. The information contained in the
                            Department’s No. 69, April 30, 7 p.m. was only communicated to the
                            Ministry of Foreign Affairs on May 2. While I have today again spoken to
                            Guani who has promised me that he will endeavor to give me a definite
                            reply in the next few days as to whether the list is acceptable, I do
                            not feel that it would be advisable to press him further in view of the
                            long delay in resuming the discussions and the already evident
                            sensitiveness of the Uruguayan Government that we are conducting the
                            negotiations merely as a corollary to those in Buenos Aires. I earnestly
                            recommend therefore that the announcement be postponed if at all
                            possible until the expected reply is received from Guani.</p>

                            Uruguay.</p>
                        <p>There is enclosed such a draft including a proposed draft of Final

                            unless you perceive objection, you should transmit to the appropriate
                            Uruguayan officials. In doing so you should state that the articles of
                            the draft are either identical, or similar in substance, to those
                            proposed during the previous negotiations in 1939, except for the
                            modifications indicated below.</p>
                        <p>Article IV relating to exchange control now provides, in the event that
                            either country maintains any system of exchange control, merely for
                            most-favored-nation treatment with respect to (1) transfers of payment
                            for, or payments necessary or incidental to, the importation of any
                            article originating in the other country; (2) rates of exchange and
                            taxes or charges on exchange transactions in connection with any such
                            payments, on a like article basis. Moreover, numbered paragraph 3
                            provides an escape clause from these provisions in time of war or other
                            national emergency on the condition only that the Government availing
                            itself of this clause inform the Government of the other country in
                            writing of the action taken. This clause, which is necessary on our part
                            because of existing law (Section 5(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) of the Act
                            of October 6, 1917, as amended by Public Resolution no. 69, <pb n="567"

                            will be acceptable to the Uruguayan Government whether or not similar
                            legislation for dealing with emergencies exists in Uruguay.</p>

                            exchange control article which was proposed by this Government in the
                            previous negotiations with the Uruguayan Government, and which was
                            previously considered as standard for inclusion in trade agreements,
                            have been made in compliance with the wishes of the Treasury Department
                            which desires to retain greater freedom of action, in connection with
                            the operation of its Foreign Funds Control, with respect to matters
                            affecting international transfers of payment than would be permitted by
                            the former exchange control article requiring no restriction or delay on
                            transfers of commercial payments.</p>

                                record of conversation found in Department files. Harry C. Hawkins
                                was Chief of the Division of Commercial Treaties and
                                Agreements.</note> Confidential note has just been received from
                            Foreign Office in reply to my memorandum of May 2 transmitting a list of
                            products upon which the United States would be disposed to make
                            concessions to Uruguay. The Uruguayan Foreign Office suggests that
                            linseed oil be retained on the list and in addition to other articles on
                            the list consideration be given with respect to the following items:
                            turkeys, canned mutton, tanned leather, dried and pickled lamb skins,
                            eggs, bird seed, citrus fruits, fine wools, shoes.</p>
                        <p>In the Legation’s opinion Uruguay is not justified in asking for special
                            consideration on many of these items since exports are negligible and in
                            any case this country could hardly be considered as an important source
                            of supply.</p>
                        <p>The Department, however, may wish to give some consideration to the
                            following items: fine wools, bird seed, canned mutton, dried and pickled
                            lamb skins and certain grades in leathers.</p>
                        <pb n="568" xml:id="pg_568" facs="0576"/>
                        <p>It is obvious that Uruguay is including in its list practically all items
                            which it makes any pretense to export. In view of the fact, however,
                            that the request has been tendered through official channels Glover and
                            I feel that it is undesirable to give the appearance of rejecting any
                            part thereof offhand, and I would be grateful for the Department’s
                            instructions.</p>

                        <p>257. Department’s 124, June 19, 8 p.m. In discussing the memorandum which
                            I left with him yesterday the Foreign Minister admitted that he
                            personally had not given much consideration to the supplemental list and
                            he implied that most of the items had been put there more as a gesture
                            to satisfy local industries rather than because of their commercial
                            importance. He did, however, express <pb n="569" xml:id="pg_569"
                                facs="0577"/>considerable interest in obtaining a concession with
                            regard to classifications of fine wools, although I endeavored to
                            explain that Uruguay was not the principal source of United States
                            imports.</p>
                        <p>While Guani reaffirmed the Uruguayan desire to sign its agreement more or
                            less simultaneously with Argentina, I gathered the impression that now
                            that the matter is approaching the negotiation stage his interest is not
                            as keen as before, possibly because of the press of what he may feel to
                            be more urgent business as well as because Uruguayan export trade to the
                            United States is now extremely flourishing.</p>
                        <p>Due to the personal attention which he gives to each phase of the Foreign
                            Office, Guani’s interest and active participation are essential to any
                            substantial progress in negotiations. While the Legation is affording
                            him every opportunity to prepare the way for the final negotiations in
                            order to achieve a simultaneous conclusion I suggest that it would be
                            inadvisable and probably ineffective to press Guani in view of the many
                            other problems demanding his attention.</p>

                        <p>307. Informal conversations with representatives of the Uruguayan
                            Government headed by the Director of the Commercial Section of the
                            Foreign Office<note n="33a" xml:id="d474fn33a">Felipe S. Grucci.</note>
                            were finally inaugurated last week but unfortunately not much progress
                            has been made due mainly to the basic divergence in point of view, the
                            representatives of the Bank of the Republic being obviously reluctant to
                            recede from the arbitrary methods of allotment of exchange and import
                            quotas now practiced by the bank, which represents a source of
                            considerable income as well as a means of controlling importation. As
                            the Department can appreciate, Uruguay’s exports to the United States
                            are at present highly satisfactory and there are no immediate advantages
                            beyond prestige now to be gained by Uruguay through a trade agreement.
                            It appears, therefore, unfortunately that the advantages to be sought
                            are mainly for our own account.</p>
                        <p>Although it is realized that the Department may be reluctant to connect
                            our general trade agreement policy with our procurement program as
                            respects wool and other Uruguayan supplies requested or our export
                            control policy as respects materials urgently required here, it may be
                            necessary to capitalize on these controlling factors in order to obtain
                            a prompt and satisfactory trade agreement.</p>
                        <pb n="570" xml:id="pg_570" facs="0578"/>
                        <p>While the Embassy will make every effort to further the progress of the
                            negotiations on the general provisions I feel obliged, in view of the
                            situation described in the first paragraph, to point out that Uruguayan
                            officials apparently feel no great urgency in conducting the
                            negotiations. Moreover, press of important and urgent work connected
                            with export control and undesirable agencies and particularly that
                            arising from demands made by firms on the President’s blacklist
                            published yesterday has in effect swamped the Commercial Section of the
                            Embassy. It is imperative that the additional personnel envisaged for

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Reference is made to the Department’s
                            telegram no. 166 of July 18, 1941<note n="35" xml:id="d475fn35">Not
                                printed.</note> stating that our definitive proposals with respect
                            to Schedules I and II of the proposed trade agreement would be
                            transmitted within a few days.</p>
                        <p>These proposals are enclosed herewith together with two memoranda showing
                            (1) the items in respect of which our present offers constitute an
                            improvement compared with the proposals made in December 1939; (2) the
                            comparative trade coverage of the proposed Schedules (enclosures 1 to 4,
                                respectively).<note n="36" xml:id="d475fn36">None printed.</note>
                            You are requested to transmit these proposals to the appropriate
                            Uruguayan authorities. In doing so, their strictly confidential nature
                            should be emphasized.</p>
                        <p>Should the Embassy, prior to transmitting these proposals to the
                            Uruguayan Government, desire to make any comments in regard thereto on
                            the basis of available information, such comments should be reported to
                            the Department by telegram.</p>
                        <p>You will note that the proposed Schedule I provides for exemption of all
                            scheduled items from payment of any portion of the Uruguayan import
                            charges in gold. The elimination of the gold payment requirement with
                            respect to each of these items, in addition to effecting a reduction in
                            import charges, would do away with the present uncertainty in the
                            calculation of such charges, and would simplify customs procedure.</p>
                        <pb n="571" xml:id="pg_571" facs="0579"/>
                        <p>It may also be noted that Item number 167 of the Raw Materials Schedule
                            combines and supersedes present tariff Item numbers 82 to 86 inclusive,
                            120, 121, and 167. You should request a concession on Item 167 in the
                            form indicated in the proposed Schedule I, but in the event the
                            Uruguayan Government should indicate that it would prefer not to
                            consolidate these tariff items, you are authorized to request the
                            proposed concessions on these items set forth separately.</p>
                        <p>As regards Schedule II, you should emphasize, by specific reference to
                            the pertinent memorandum, that our present proposals constitute a
                            substantial improvement over those offered in December 1939, and that
                            concessions of the magnitude proposed should be of substantial benefit
                            to the Uruguayan economy, even at the present time, and, upon the
                            resumption of more normal trade and shipping conditions, of even greater
                            value. The concessions requested for inclusion in Schedule I are
                            considered moderate, and would tend to offset the increased costs
                            incident to the importation into Uruguay of the articles covered by the
                            Schedule, with corresponding benefits to the Uruguayan consumers.</p>

                        <p>440. In spite of constant prodding and frequent inquiries on the part of
                            the Embassy, the Uruguayans have failed thus far to submit
                            counter-proposals or observations on our drafts of general provisions or
                            schedules. At the same time they have constantly assured us that our
                            proposals were being studied by various Government agencies and that
                            conversations would be resumed shortly. The delay is probably due
                            primarily to the chronic dilatoriness of Uruguayan officials in such
                            matters. However, other factors in the situation may well be the present
                            satisfactory state of Uruguayan exports to the United States and lack of
                            any particular interest in the negotiations on the part of Dr. Guani
                            since the abandonment of his projected trip to the United States.</p>

                            negotiations with us are farther advanced than is actually the case.</p>
                        <p>The Director of Commercial Affairs of the Foreign Office informed Chapin
                            last week that an important meeting of Uruguayan officials will be held
                            tomorrow to consider our proposals and that informal conversations with
                            the Embassy could probably be resumed within a few days. He reiterated
                            that the principal stumbling block remained the question of most favored
                            nation treatment as respects exchange control but that his first
                            impression after reading the appropriate clause of our agreement with
                            Argentina was that some similar formula might be worked out with
                            Uruguay.</p>
                        <p>As soon as further information is available regarding the Uruguayan
                            attitude, I shall report by cable with respect to prospects and our
                            recommendations.</p>

                        <p>444. Not realizing our policy and practice in such matters, many
                            Uruguayan exporters and officials believe that when the trade agreement
                            with Argentina takes effect on November 15 Argentine products will enjoy
                            preferential treatment making it impossible for similar Uruguayan
                            products to compete. Guani has taken the matter up with me and I have of
                            course explained the true situation to him. He requests that I address
                            him a note in order that the Foreign Office may release a reassuring
                            statement.</p>

                            Foreign Office a note in which, after quoting section 350 (<hi

                        <p>282. Your no. 444, October 24, 11 a.m. It is hoped that in the course of
                            your oral explanation to the Foreign Minister you indicated that the
                            best way for Uruguay to assure itself of most-favored-nation treatment
                            would be to enter into a trade agreement along the lines of our
                            proposal.</p>
                        <p>With reference to your proposed note, some change is necessary if for no
                            other reason than that the entire message, including the portion quoted,
                            was transmitted in confidential code.</p>
                        <p>It is suggested that you inform the Foreign Minister that it is the
                            established policy of your Government, pursuant to the pertinent
                            provisions of the Trade Agreements Act, to extend the application of
                            reduced rates of duty provided for in trade agreements with foreign
                            countries other than Cuba to the like products of all countries, except
                            that the President may suspend the application of such reduced rates of
                            duty to products of any country because of discriminations against the
                            commerce of the United States or other acts or policies tending to
                            defeat the purposes of the Act. You may add that all trade-agreement
                            rates of duty hitherto generalized have been made applicable to products
                            of Uruguay and state that you have no reason to expect that there will
                            be any change in this situation in connection with the trade agreement
                            with Argentina. The President’s letter to the Secretary of the Treasury
                            in regard to the generalization of rates of duty provided for in that
                            agreement will be issued prior to November 15.<note n="39"

                        <p>454. Department’s telegram 282, of October 25. In the conversation in
                            question I of course took advantage of the opportunity to point out to
                            the Minister of Foreign Relations that the prompt conclusion of the
                            proposed trade agreement was the best means of assuring
                            most-favored-nation treatment for Uruguayan exports. We are urging this
                            point of view on the Uruguayans and shall continue to do so.</p>

                            which we shall push as rapidly as possible. Following today’s meeting
                            our present impression is that a mutually satisfactory formula assuring
                            us most-favored-nation treatment as respects exchange control is the
                            principal stumbling block and presents a serious problem which may

                        <p>296. Your 454, October 28, 7 p.m. Consideration continues to be given to
                            the possibility of sending someone to assist you in bringing the
                            trade-agreement negotiations to a conclusion. You will appreciate that,
                            apart from other considerations, the Department would hesitate to send
                            an officer from Washington unless assured that the Uruguayans are
                            disposed to cooperate wholeheartedly in bringing the negotiations to a
                            successful conclusion as rapidly as possible.</p>
                        <p>Much of the delay seems to have resulted from failure on the part of the
                            Uruguayans to give prompt consideration to our proposals and submit
                            specific counterproposals.</p>
                        <p>It is believed that there should be no great difficulty in regard to the
                            general provisions or Schedule II. We have made our offers in Schedule
                            II as liberal as we can make them, and the general provisions as
                            proposed and as they appear with related notes in the agreement with
                            Argentina represent not only what we would agree to if necessary in the
                            case of Uruguay but also, in so far as exceptions are concerned, the
                            ultimate to which we could go. If somewhat better general provisions in
                            regard to such matters as exchange and quotas could be obtained without
                            difficulty or undue delay, that would be desirable. However, in order to
                            avoid any unnecessary delay it is suggested that you base future
                            discussions on the Argentine text and pertinent related notes in so far
                            as the latter apply to Uruguay’s situations; also that you make discreet
                            use of the final <pb n="575" xml:id="pg_575" facs="0583"/>minutes worked
                            out in connection with the Argentine agreement to cover similarly such
                            points therein dealt with as the Uruguayans may be unwilling to
                            incorporate in the general provisions or notes to be published.</p>
                        <p>Copies of the text of the Argentine agreement including related notes,
                            together with an analysis thereof, and the unpublished final minutes are
                            on the way to you by air mail. These texts are substantially the same as
                            those enclosed with the Department’s instruction no. 295 of May 28,
                            1941.</p>
                        <p>The main problem appears to be the working out of a satisfactory Schedule
                            I, and it is difficult to estimate how much of a task this may be in the
                            absence of specific Uruguayan counterproposals. Such counterproposals
                            would facilitate a decision in regard to the question of sending someone
                            to assist the Embassy in the final stages of negotiations.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to my telegram
                            no. 440 of October 20, 4 p.m., and to report that informal negotiations
                            were resumed on October 17 with the following Uruguayan representatives:
                            Sr. Felipe S. Grucci, Director of the Section of Commercial Affairs of
                            the Uruguayan Foreign Office, Sr. Silveira Zorzi of the Bank of the
                            Republic of Uruguay, and Sr. Mario L. La Gamma of the Ministry of
                            Finance. The representatives of the Embassy were Mr. Chapin, First
                            Secretary, Mr. Glover, Commercial Attaché, and Mr. Gilmore, Economic
                            Analyst.</p>
                        <p>Although it was evident at the first meeting that certain minor
                            modifications would have to be made in Draft Schedule I prepared by the
                            Department, in order to meet certain recent changes in wording in the
                            Uruguayan tariff schedules, comparatively little difficulty is expected
                            in reaching a mutually satisfactory accord on the wording and the
                            coverage of the tariff concessions requested and those to be given to
                            Uruguay. The word “comparatively” is used advisedly, since the first
                            meeting once again emphasized the divergence between the point of view
                            advocated by the United States of unconditional most-favored-nation
                            treatment, which forms the basis for our whole trade-agreement program,
                            and that of Uruguay which is based upon the principle of narrow
                            bilateral commercial agreements.</p>
                        <p>The Uruguayan representatives have on every occasion reiterated their
                            theoretical acceptance of the principle of multilateral trade with <pb
                                n="576" xml:id="pg_576" facs="0584"/>unconditional
                            most-favored-nation treatment, but have just as consistently stated that
                            since the countries which form the most important outlets for their
                            products have abandoned this system, have refused to recognize this
                            liberal principle and have imposed the bilateral system upon Uruguay in
                            binding agreements, they are unable to subscribe without reservation to
                            the liberal principles advocated by the United States, particularly as
                            they are contained in the provisions of Article IV of the current draft
                            of the general provisions.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, it may well be that even were Uruguay free to adopt the
                            principles which we advocate, the Bank of the Republic, which controls
                            the economic life of the country, has found the present complicated
                            system of exchange control so lucrative a source of revenue and such an
                            advantageous weapon in its manipulation of Uruguay’s foreign trade that
                            it would be reluctant to adopt in fact the principles to which it now
                            gives lip service.</p>
                        <p>In the course of a second meeting on October 28 the Embassy’s
                            representatives endeavored to set forth the advantages which our
                            Government believes are inherent in the principle of unrestricted
                            multilateral commerce. They pointed out as well that while it was
                            desirable to construct an agreement which might have as permanent a
                            character as possible, it was also clear that no one could foresee what
                            course world economic conditions might take following the termination of
                            present hostilities and that it seemed quite probable that all existing
                            trade and commercial agreements would require some revision as soon as
                            the post-war situation had begun to clarify. The escape features of
                            Articles IV and XII were called to the attention of the Uruguayan
                            negotiators but it cannot be said that they showed any disposition to
                            recede from their position.</p>
                        <p>The Uruguayans were aware of the concessions granted by the United States
                            in the exchange of notes supplementing the trade agreement recently
                            signed with Argentina, exempting the British payments agreement from the
                            provisions of Article IV, and they affirmed that Uruguay was in the same
                            position as was Argentina with respect to sterling blocked balances. The
                            representatives of the Embassy countered by requesting detailed
                            information concerning Uruguay’s present sterling position and were
                            informed that this information would be supplied. At the request of the
                            chairman of the Uruguayan delegation a copy of the text of our note to
                            the Argentine Government was furnished to the Uruguayan delegation. They
                            stated that they would use this text as a basis for drafting a
                            counter-proposal giving the Uruguayan interpretation of Articles IV and
                            XII in the light of their own exchange situation.</p>
                        <p>At a third meeting held on November 4 the chairman of the Uruguayan
                            delegation presented a memorandum together with two draft <pb n="577"
                                xml:id="pg_577" facs="0585"/>notes, copies and translations of which
                            are enclosed with this despatch.<note n="42" xml:id="d481fn42">None
                                printed.</note> It will be observed from the text of the covering
                            memorandum that the divergency in basic view points is still as wide as
                            ever. However, the memorandum brings out the rather ingenuous argument
                            that, since the United States is not in a position to accord tariff
                            concessions to Uruguay which have the relative importance of those
                            accorded to Argentina, it should be willing to allow greater latitude to
                            Uruguay with respect to its exchange-control policy. Specifically, the
                            memorandum proposes that Uruguay consider itself bound to give
                            most-favored-nation treatment as respects exchange to the United States
                            only when the facilities available to Uruguay permit it to do so. In
                            effect, the wording of the second draft note is just as loose as
                            that.</p>
                        <p>The first note is modelled in general upon the exchange of notes
                            supplementing the Argentine Agreement, although here again the wording
                            is somewhat looser.</p>
                        <p>In accepting the memorandum and the draft notes, the representatives of
                            the Embassy stated that they were of course not in a position to make
                            any reply but would submit the text of the documents to the Department
                            for study. However, they did observe that, even in the unlikely event
                            that it were possible to make a specific concession of this nature to
                            Uruguay alone, it would probably prove impracticable on the basic ground
                            that such a concession, if given to Uruguay, would have to be
                            generalized to every other country entitled to most-favored-nation
                            treatment by the United States.</p>
                        <p>From the foregoing and from a study of the enclosures the Department will
                            realize the difficulty of reconciling the two points of view and that a
                            good deal of persuasion may be necessary before the Uruguayan Government
                            can be disposed to recede from its position. In this connection it will
                            be recalled that no original concessions of any importance not covered
                            in the Argentine Trade Agreement have been offered by this Government to
                            Uruguay. While persuasive arguments by a trained specialist in
                            trade-agreement negotiations may be of some assistance in obtaining a
                            modification of the Uruguayan position, it is to be feared that unless
                            we offer some special inducement or bring some special economic pressure
                            upon Uruguay it will be very difficult, if not impossible, to obtain a
                            satisfactory agreement.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to my despatch
                            No. 270 of November 5 reporting on the state of the resumed negotiations
                            for a trade agreement with Uruguay and particularly on the divergence of
                            viewpoint which has been encountered over the proposal to extend
                            complete most-favored nation treatment with regard not only to
                            commodities but also with regard to exchange.</p>
                        <p>It will be observed from the draft notes submitted by the Uruguayan
                            representatives at the third meeting on November 4 as a
                            counter-proposal, that the Uruguayan representatives take the position
                            that while subscribing to the principle of complete most-favored nation
                            treatment, they have been forced to adopt the bilateral policy by the
                            insistence of the European countries which constitute their principal
                            purchasers, and that in particular they attribute this pressure to the
                            policy of the United Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy has reason to believe that the British Government has in fact
                            exerted considerable influence upon the Uruguayan authorities and has on
                            several occasions brought pressure to bear when the Uruguayan
                            authorities seemed likely to grant more liberal treatment as regards
                            exchange to Uruguayan imports from the United States, when these imports
                            consisted of what are known as “American specialties” but which are
                            competitive to similar British products. Even today when practically all
                            coal imported into Uruguay must be purchased in the United States since
                            shipping facilities are not available for this product to be imported
                            from Great Britain, the British Legation in Montevideo has insisted that
                            each order for coal first be cleared with the Commercial Secretary
                            before being finally concluded.</p>
                        <p>A representative of the Bank of England and indirectly of the British
                            Treasury, Mr. Phillimore, who has been covering Argentina, Uruguay, and
                            Brazil, recently called at the Embassy when he frankly expressed the
                            considerable interest of his Government in learning of the demands the
                            United States might make in its trade agreement negotiations and
                            specifically whether we might ask for liberal exchange treatment which
                            would conflict with the provisions of the British Trade Treaty. He was
                            informed at the time that the progress of negotiations was not such as
                            to be able to give him any information of a concrete nature, but the
                            frankness of his approach gives further evidence, if such were needed,
                            that the British Government does not look with complete favor upon our
                            efforts in this area <pb n="579" xml:id="pg_579" facs="0587"/>at
                            extending the basic principles of the Secretary’s liberal trade
                            policy.</p>
                        <p>The thought has occurred to me, since as stated above the Uruguayan
                            negotiators base their attitude primarily on their contractual
                            obligations to Great Britain, that it might be helpful if the British
                            Government could be induced to inform the Uruguayan Government that far
                            from placing obstacles in the path of the negotiations between our
                            Government and Uruguay, it looked with favor upon the extension of
                            liberal trade practices and in fact would be prepared to relax some of
                            the provisions of the existing trade treaty between Uruguay and the
                            United Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>Although it is realized that little concrete has been accomplished in the
                            plans for a post-war policy of trade cooperation and coordination
                            between the British commonwealth of nations and the United States,
                            according to the statements of the new British Minister in Montevideo,
                            Mr. Stevenson, it appears that the British Government may have
                            manifested some interest in the general proposal. In any event, it seems
                            unlikely in view of the cooperation and assistance which we have been
                            extending to the British Government that that Government would not wish
                            in turn to cooperate with the United States in the extension of one of
                            our most cherished policies in the inter-American field. I therefore
                            venture the suggestion that the Department may wish to consider raising
                            with the British Embassy in Washington our general aspirations in South
                            America for the extension of liberal trade principles and more
                            specifically inquiring whether the British Government would be disposed
                            to inform the Uruguayan Government that it might reconsider certain of
                            the provisions of its own trade treaty with Uruguay in order to
                            facilitate the conclusion of the proposed United States trade agreement
                            with Uruguay.</p>

                            Uruguayan Government ever expressed—except in the most general and
                            non-committal terms—a willingness to accord non-discriminatory exchange
                            treatment to imports from the United States if this means relinquishing
                            control over the exchange created by their exports to Great Britain and

                                    discussed the possibility of an agreement with the Directors of
                                    the Bank of the Republic and with the Minister of Finance, that
                                    they had canvassed the various possible suggestions to be made

                                    memorandum presented this morning, and that the conclusion of
                                    the Uruguayan officials had been that it was not practicable for
                                    the Uruguayan Government to abandon its system of bilateral
                                    trade. He stated that he had been authorized to express the

                                    in preliminary form and that this statement would subsequently

                                    the American memorandum, if desired. Mr. Fowler decided that in
                                    view of the very informal character of these discussions the
                                    preparation of a memorandum would not be necessary.</p>

                                    to the United States. He added that the main cause of the
                                    present commercial difficulties was the high American duties,
                                    and that if they should be reduced Uruguayan exports to the
                                    United States would doubtless increase, and that under such
                                    circumstances an import quota would be assigned for American
                                    goods and the present difficulties would be over.</p>
                                <p>“He repeated the often-stated position of the Uruguayan
                                    Government that theoretically it favored multilateral trade, but
                                    because of pressure on the part of European nations, which
                                    together have purchased some 80 percent of Uruguayan exports,
                                    Uruguay was not in a position to engage in multilateral
                                    trade.</p>
                                <p>“Mr. Fowler pointed out that the memorandum proposed restriction
                                    of imports by classes of merchandise rather than by countries,
                                    and that the former plan would offer Uruguay ample opportunities
                                    for balancing payments. Señor Silveira Zorzi said, however, that
                                    this system did not provide exchange, and that its adoption
                                    would undoubtedly result in an immediate decrease of Uruguay’s
                                    exports.</p>
                                <p>“Mr. Fowler stated that the British officials now in charge of
                                    foreign trade matters were not the same as those of a few years
                                    ago, and that he believed that they were willing to consider a
                                    more liberal treatment of the River Plate countries, and asked
                                    whether, in the event that the British Government should relax
                                    its pressure on Uruguayan exchange, the Uruguayan Government
                                    would be willing to consider the abandonment of the bilateral
                                    system. Señor Silveira Zorzi said, and was supported by Señor
                                    Grucci, that such a possibility was extremely interesting to the
                                    Uruguayan Government, and that if it existed the Government
                                    would be glad to give serious consideration to an alteration of
                                    its policy.</p>
                                <p>“Failing any alteration of policy, however, by the British
                                    Government, the American proposal was not acceptable at

                                        to take 1934 as the ‘previous representative period’ in
                                        fixing the initial quotas. They believe this would cause no

                                        accepted as a satisfactory representative period for fixing

                            earlier discussions. As indicated in the Embassy’s despatch No. 270 of
                            November 5, 1941, however, these concessions to the Uruguayan viewpoint
                            have apparently served only to prompt a request that Uruguay be allowed
                            in effect to continue the complete latitude with respect to the
                            allocation of exchange for American products that has heretofore been

                                Therefore, the Department feels that you should refrain from taking
                                up this matter officially with the British Minister at this time.
                                However, should the opportunity present itself, the Department
                                perceives no objection to your discussing the matter with him in

                            <item>It is not our intention to seek in a trade agreement with Uruguay
                                more rigorous assurances of nondiscriminatory treatment than we
                                obtained in our recent agreement with Argentina; more particularly,
                                we would not expect to include therein provisions which would
                                require a modification of Uruguay’s war-time payments arrangement
                                with the United Kingdom. What we do hope to obtain is formal
                                recognition on the part of the Uruguayan Government of the basic
                                principles of nondiscriminatory treatment and multilateral trade
                                with assurances that it will, on the coming into force of the
                                agreement, abolish existing discriminations against imports of
                                American origin other than those excepted in the two proposed
                                exchanges of notes as was done in the case of Argentina. Even these
                                we would expect to have eliminated as rapidly as circumstances
                                permit.</item>

                            <item>It would appear that Uruguay’s present trade position and import
                                control system would permit its acceptance of general provisions and
                                related notes substantially the same as those contained in our
                                agreement with Argentina. As regards this point, please report
                                specifically what modifications, if any, of Uruguay’s present import
                                control system and contractual obligations would be necessitated by
                                its acceptance of general provisions and related notes <pb n="585"
                                    xml:id="pg_585" facs="0593"/>similar to those in our trade
                                agreement with Argentina. In this connection, the Department
                                perceives no good reason why Uruguay should continue in force
                                contractual commitments to certain countries other than the United
                                Kingdom, if such commitments, which have become practically
                                inoperative because of the war, stand in the way of the conclusion
                                of a trade agreement with the United States embodying the principles
                                of nondiscriminatory treatment.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>Accordingly, unless you perceive objection, you should inform the
                                appropriate Uruguayan authorities in the sense of the foregoing and
                                state that therefore the Department, while prepared to accept the
                                same reservations on Uruguay’s part as are contained in the two
                                exchanges of notes accompanying the trade agreement between the
                                United States and Argentina, nevertheless feels that it cannot agree
                                to a further reservation such as that embodied in the third exchange
                                of notes proposed by the Uruguayan authorities. Such a reservation
                                might in certain circumstances be construed as in effect completely
                                nullifying the proposed provisions of the agreement relating to
                                nondiscriminatory treatment by Uruguay of American commerce.
                                However, you should state that if, following the coming into force
                                of the agreement, any circumstance should develop in Uruguay’s
                                commercial relations with a third country which it considered,
                                because of the commitments in its trade agreement with the United
                                States, had the effect of prejudicing the commerce of Uruguay, the
                                Government of Uruguay might invoke paragraph 1 of Article XII of the
                                proposed general provisions.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>With reference to the Uruguayan statement that the trade agreement
                                concluded recently between the United States and Argentina accords
                                the latter nation advantages which do not benefit Uruguay, you
                                should point out that the tariff concessions granted by the United
                                States to Argentina apply to products which in 1939 and 1940
                                accounted for 62 and 35 percent, respectively, of the value of total
                                imports for consumption into the United States from Uruguay. In this
                                connection, you should also emphasize that the conclusion of a trade
                                agreement between the United States and Uruguay would provide a
                                contractual basis for the continued extension to Uruguay by the
                                United States of the benefit of the tariff concessions made by the
                                United States in existing trade agreements with Argentina and other
                                countries, as well as any concession on fine wools which the United
                                States might at some future time grant in a trade agreement with the
                                principal supplier of these wools.</item>

                            part as are embodied in exchange of notes accompanying agreement with
                            Argentina would be acceptable.</p>

                            324, please telegraph that portion of text of proposed note which
                            differs from corresponding Argentine note.</p>
                        <p>It is believed that the views expressed today by Zorzi indicate that the
                            Uruguayan Government is now prepared to accept our position with respect
                            to the general provisions and related notes and that a statement to this
                            effect will be officially communicated to the Embassy at a meeting with
                            appropriate officials, arranged for December 22. If the Department does
                            not find it necessary to insist upon more than a very limited number of
                            improvements in the concessions offered in the Uruguayan counterproposal
                            to schedule I transmitted with my despatch under reference it is
                            believed that negotiations can be terminated within the near future.</p>
                        <p>Certain necessary clarification of nomenclature included in
                            aforementioned counterproposal together with Embassy’s recommendations
                            will be submitted in subsequent telegram.</p>

                        <p>567. At this morning’s meeting the Uruguayan subcommittee orally agreed
                            to recommend to the Cabinet that our proposed general provisions with
                            the exception of article 2 be accepted if accompanied by the related
                            notes described below: <pb n="588" xml:id="pg_588" facs="0596"/>

                                <item>Note based on text of Argentine note regarding preferences to
                                    contiguous countries with the addition of the words “and Bolivia
                                    and Paraguay” following the phrases “to a contiguous country”
                                    and “to contiguous countries” in sections 1 and 2 of the last
                                    substantive paragraph. Wherever they appear the words “and Peru”
                                    will be omitted. There will of course be other changes in
                                    terminology consistent with the two foregoing amendments. These
                                    modifications are designed to permit Uruguay to accord permanent
                                    tariff preferences and temporary exchange preferences to Bolivia
                                    and Paraguay as well as to contiguous countries. Pursuant to
                                    convention No. 8 contained in the Final Minutes of the Regional
                                    Conference of the River Plate Countries (transmitted with the
                                    Embassy despatch No. 778 of February 8, 1941<note n="56"

                                <item>As regards article 2, Uruguayans propose the addition of a
                                    second paragraph as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                        <p>“The provisions of this article relating to national
                                            treatment shall not apply to taxes imposed by the
                                            Oriental Republic of Uruguay on pharmaceutical
                                            specialties, toilet and perfumery products, cigarettes,
                                            cigars, fortified wines, vermouth, champagne, matches,
                                            and playing cards.”</p>

                            </list></p>
                        <p>It may be explained that the existing internal taxes levied upon the
                            above-enumerated products of national origin are slightly lower than
                            those imposed on similar articles of foreign origin. The subcommittee
                            expects to meet no the[<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] serious difficulties
                            in securing the Cabinet’s approval of the above proposals and therefore
                            hopes to subject [<hi rend="italic">submit?</hi>] a formal memorandum to
                            the Embassy in confirmation thereof not later than December 24.</p>

                        <p>580. Embassy’s telegram No. 567, December 22. Memoranda presented to
                            Embassy this afternoon by Foreign Office confirm oral acceptance of our
                            proposed general provisions contingent upon our <pb n="589"
                                xml:id="pg_589" facs="0597"/>willingness, first, to add a paragraph
                            to article II along general lines of that described in paragraph 3 of
                            Embassy’s telegram under reference, second, to suppress paragraph 1 of
                            article XVI and, third, to amend note regarding preferences to
                            contiguous countries to include Bolivia and Paraguay (see paragraph 1,
                            Embassy’s telegram No. 567).</p>
                        <p>Uruguayans contend that their basic customs law does not permit any
                            consideration of intent in connection with errors in documentation. (See
                            Embassy’s despatch No. 897 of April 23, 1941.) It is pointed out,
                            however, that the customs regulations permit an importer to examine,
                            weigh, and extract samples from shipments before beginning clearance
                            proceedings. The Department’s early reaction to the Uruguayan proposal
                            with respect to the inclusion of Bolivia and Paraguay in the contiguous
                            country note would be appreciated.</p>

                            contained in the Uruguayan counterproposal with respect to automobiles,
                            it may be noted that with the net duty on a Chevrolet weighing 1,380
                            kilos amounting to 633 Uruguayan pesos on the basis of the reduced rate
                            offered in the Uruguayan counterproposal, it will be found that their
                            contention that this amount of duty is equivalent to that imposed by
                            Argentina is without foundation. As a matter of fact the Uruguayan duty
                            charges would continue to be almost double those provided for in the
                            Argentine agreement. It is therefore recommended that the Embassy be
                            authorized to make a determined effort to obtain a greater reduction of
                            duties on automobiles</p>

                        <p>226. The Federal Loan Agency is prepared to enter into an agreement with
                            the Uruguayan Government whereby, upon the establishment of an export
                            control system prohibiting the export of wool and hides from Uruguay
                            except to the United States, to other American republics having systems
                            of export control satisfactory to the Government of the United States,
                            and to the British Empire, the Federal Loan Agency will agree to
                            purchase the entire exportable surpluses of wool and hides in Uruguay
                            other than that purchased by United States private trade, the other
                            American republics and the British Empire. The agreement would take the
                            form of a commitment by the <pb n="591" xml:id="pg_591" facs="0599"
                            />Loan Agency to buy a fixed amount of the products in question at
                            prices slightly under the current market price. These fixed maxima would
                            be in amounts corresponding to the total exports of the products in
                            question for the preceding year. The obligation of the Loan Agency would
                            thus, in effect, be to take the entire exportable surplus not required
                            by other approved purchasers. As you are no doubt aware, negotiations
                            are now under way for the purchase by the Federal Loan Agency of various
                            Argentine products,<note n="58" xml:id="d493fn58">See <ref

                            be in substantially the form suggested above.</p>
                        <p>Prices would have to be established for each of the various grades of
                            wool and hides, and there would probably be certain grades which would
                            have to be excluded from the agreement for quality reasons.</p>
                        <p>You are requested to consult with the appropriate Uruguayan authorities
                            and to inquire whether such an agreement is acceptable in principle to
                            them. If it is, the Federal Loan Agency will designate some one in
                            Montevideo or will send some one there to collaborate with you in
                            negotiating the agreement.</p>

                        <p>411. Department’s telegram 226 of September 9. Our proposal was submitted
                            to the Foreign Office in a note dated September 9 and shortly thereafter
                            I had an opportunity to discuss it with Guani<note n="59"
                                xml:id="d494fn59">Alberto Guani, Uruguayan Minister for Foreign
                                Affairs.</note> and the President.<note n="60" xml:id="d494fn60"
                                >Alfredo Baldomir.</note> The latter’s immediate reaction was that
                            while the proposal was interesting Uruguay’s commercial treaty with
                            Japan might prove an obstacle. No reply has thus far been received from
                            the Foreign Office. However, the Foreign Office expert handling the
                            matter tells me confidentially that in his opinion the establishment of
                            the export control system which we propose would be inconsistent with
                            Uruguay’s commercial treaties with Japan and Sweden.<note n="61"

                        <p>278. Reference your 411, October 1. Has a report been received from the
                            Foreign Office? The Department agrees with the suggestion that an
                            agreement between the producers and Defense Suplies Corporation would
                            not be satisfactory. The commercial treaties referred to in your 411 are
                            concerned chiefly with customs duties, and it appears to the Department
                            that it would not be inconsistent with those treaties for the Uruguayan
                            Government to enter into an agreement with Defense Supplies Corporation
                            and the British Government agreeing to sell to them a specified amount
                            of hides and wool of certain grades, which amount would be in excess of
                            the recent production of Uruguay. The agreement would also provide that
                            the Uruguayan Government would not be under liability for failure to
                            obtain and sell the maximum amounts of hides and wools specified; its
                            obligation being restricted to a commitment to use its best efforts to
                            cause the respective amounts of hides and wool to be produced and sold
                            to Defense Supplies Corporation and the British Government. The
                            agreement would not contain a provision for export control prohibiting
                            the export of hides and wool to countries other than the United States
                            and Great Britain, but by reason of the size of the commitment to those
                            two countries, the agreement would have the effect of causing the entire
                            production of hides and wool to be made available to the United States
                            and Great Britain. You are requested to explore the possibility of such
                            a solution with the Uruguayan authorities and to telegraph the
                            Department.</p>

                        <p>448. Department’s telegram 278 of October 23. No reply has been received
                            from the Foreign Office. I raised the matter again a few days ago with
                            Guani who told me that he was discussing it with the Bank of the
                            Republic. I acquainted him yesterday with the solution proposed in the
                            Department’s 278 which he is going to study. In our conversation
                            yesterday he told me that he had requested the Uruguayan Embassy in
                            Buenos Aires to obtain information as to the status of our negotiations
                            with Argentina regarding the similar proposal submitted to that
                            country.</p>
                        <p>I have the distinct impression that Guani desires to cooperate with us
                            and in order to expedite matters I suggest that the Defense Supplies
                            Corporation cable its representative in Buenos Aires, Thomas J.
                            Williams, authorizing him to proceed to Montevideo when I so

                            along the lines of Department 278, October 23, 11 p.m., Uruguayan
                            authorities appear favorably disposed to some such solution providing it

                        <p>The Defense Supplies Corporation would agree to buy for one year from the
                            Uruguayan Government or such agency as the latter may designate the
                            entire exportable surplus of wool and hides at prices prevailing in the
                            principal United States markets at the time of the offer. Grades and
                            qualities would be left for later determination it being understood as
                            in the case of our agreement with Argentina that we will include certain
                            grades and qualities of wool and of hides normally of little interest to
                            American consumers.</p>
                        <pb n="594" xml:id="pg_594" facs="0602"/>
                        <p>In view of existing treaty obligations Uruguay will not establish any
                            export control for these products but will place the total exportable
                            surplus at our disposal.</p>
                        <p>I also request authority to offer a commitment similar to that in the

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Chargé d’affaires</hi>: In view of the
                            impossibility, on account of the blockade, of bringing from Germany
                            turbines, generators and other elements necessary for the hydroelectric
                            plant on the Rio Negro, as you are no doubt aware, the Government is
                            attempting to find a solution to this serious difficulty which seriously
                            prejudices the national economy and the industrial development of the
                            country.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, negotiations are now taking place in the United States for
                            the urgent manufacture of the essential machinery for the installation.
                            Difficulties have been encountered recently because of the defense
                            program and the restrictions imposed by your Government for the free
                            supply of raw materials, particularly metal.</p>
                        <p>For these reasons, the Chancellery expresses to the Chargé d’affaires its
                            hope that your Government, convinced of the vital importance of the
                            above mentioned installation, will lend its good offices with respect to
                            the United States firms for a priority manufacture of the said machinery
                            and making available to this end metals to the total of 8,500 tons as
                            soon as possible.</p>

                            felt that there was certain other information which my Government would

                            </list></p>
                        <p>In conclusion, I pointed out to Dr. Guani that, while I knew that the
                            Government of the United States was always disposed and even anxious to
                            tender its cooperation to the Uruguayan Government <pb n="596"
                                xml:id="pg_596" facs="0604"/>with respect to a project of such
                            importance to the country when it might be undertaken by the Uruguayan
                            Government itself, I did not feel that my Government would be disposed
                            to assist in any project which might help German firms to maintain their
                            position in Uruguay, since this would be tantamount to aiding directly
                            totalitarian agencies which might later work against the best interests
                            of our two countries.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Guani said that he felt that the considerations which I had advanced
                            were quite understandable and entirely reasonable, and in my presence he
                            telephoned the director of the Rione (Rio Negro Project
                                Administration)<note n="69" xml:id="d499fn69">Luis Giorgi.</note>
                            and put to him confidentially the first four of the points set forth
                            above. While I naturally could hear but Dr. Guani’s part of the
                            conversation, it was very evident that the Administration had not given
                            any thought to the political aspects of its requests. I inferred that
                            the Administration had rather ingenuously taken for granted that the
                            United States Government would be willing to export the desired material
                            even though it were to be turned over to the German engineers and
                            technical men now at work on the Project.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Guani, upon terminating his telephone conversation, said that he
                            would call a meeting of all the interested Uruguayan Government
                            officials for this morning at eleven o’clock, since he felt that he must
                            explain the situation personally to the Rione Administration and to the
                            Minister of Public Works. He added that he himself felt that the
                            original contract with the German syndicate had been a very unfavorable
                            one for Uruguay, and that, in view of the manifest impossibility of the
                            German syndicate to carry out its contract at the present time, he felt
                            that whatever the provisions of the contract, the Uruguayan Government
                            had the right to insist upon its cancellation. He emphasized the
                            importance of the Project for the economy of the country, and said that
                            the continued delay was a source of serious prejudice to Uruguay. He
                            inquired whether, in the event that the contract were entirely
                            cancelled, it might be possible to obtain a loan from the Export-Import
                            Bank to complete the Project. I replied that, while I did not know what
                            the obligations of the Export-Import Bank were at the moment, and, while
                            of course I could not speak without consulting the Department, I
                            believed that I could say as my personal opinion that our Government
                            would be glad to give sympathetic consideration to such a request for
                            assistance for Uruguay, provided we had assurances that the German
                            interests had been definitely eliminated from the Project.</p>
                        <p>When I left, Dr. Guani said that he would call me immediately after the
                            meeting and give me the answers to the points which I had <pb n="597"
                                xml:id="pg_597" facs="0605"/>raised with him, so that they might be
                            included in a despatch for the airmail pouch leaving today. This he has
                            not done, and it may be assumed that he has encountered temporary
                            difficulties in obtaining the desired assurances with respect to the
                            ultimate destination and control of the material which the Rione desires
                            to purchase in the United States.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to my despatch
                            No. 939 of May 7, 1941, transmitting a copy of a note received from the
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs requesting certain assistance in connection
                            with the completion of the Rio Negro Hydroelectric Project in
                            Uruguay.</p>
                        <p>As stated in my despatch, I approached the Minister for Foreign Affairs
                            informally for supplementary information which I stated our government
                            would need before it could give full consideration to the Uruguayan
                            request. There is enclosed a copy and translation of a memorandum of May
                                8<note n="70" xml:id="d500fn70">Not printed.</note> transmitted to
                            me by the Minister for Foreign Affairs attempting to reply to the
                            specific points which I raised with him.</p>
                        <p>It will be noted that although the Uruguayan Government gives assurances
                            that the proposed purchases of hydroelectric equipment in the United
                            States are for its own account rather than that of the German syndicate
                            and will be treated as a separate contract for eventual control by the
                            Uruguayan Government, these assurances do not, in the Legation’s
                            opinion, cover the question of continued German participation in the
                            project. In particular, although it states that the proposed contract
                            with United States firms would be similar to the present contract with
                            the German syndicate and “exclusively for the execution of works made by
                            the Uruguayan Government itself”, the Uruguayan Government does not
                            venture to communicate to our government a copy of the contract with the
                            German Consortium. Finally, it may be observed that although the
                            purchase from the United States of hydroelectric equipment and its
                            installation on the project would no doubt be a direct primary benefit
                            to the Uruguayan Government, the point is not made clear that it would
                            not be an indirect benefit to the German Consortium.</p>
                        <pb n="598" xml:id="pg_598" facs="0606"/>
                        <p>Accordingly, the Legation feels that the United States Government would
                            be well within its rights if it informed the Uruguayan Government that
                            before giving any final consideration to the request, it should be
                            furnished with a copy of the original contract between the Uruguayan
                            Government and the German Consortium, together with copies of such
                            subsidiary agreements or understandings as may in any way depend
                            therefrom.</p>
                        <p>Up to the present time, since it is without any specific instructions
                            from the Department, the Legation has not felt authorized to go so far
                            as to insist upon obtaining a copy of the contract, but it now strongly
                            recommends that the Department instruct it to do so before proceeding to
                            any final decision in the matter.</p>

                        <p>77. The Uruguayan Minister<note n="71" xml:id="d501fn71">José
                                Richling.</note> has inquired whether this Government would
                            intercede in order to assist private manufacturers with whom the
                            Uruguayan Government is now in touch to obtain the necessary equipment
                            to complete the Rio Negro hydroelectric project.</p>
                        <p>Without approaching any government authorities please endeavor to
                            ascertain at once the precise size and number of such generators and
                            turbines and any other description which you can obtain of the other
                            equipment desired. In addition it is essential that we know the
                            approximate date on which the Uruguayan Government would require
                            delivery of this equipment.</p>
                        <p>For your information the Department’s present view is that it will only
                            interest itself in securing the required priorities and export licenses
                            provided the completion of the project is entrusted to American

                        <p>Since the matter was raised I have again discussed the matter with Guani
                            and he has promised to furnish the technical details of the machinery
                            and equipment desired. As regards delivery he said no date had been set
                            because the Rione had no means of determining how long the construction
                            of the equipment which is to follow special specifications, no doubt
                            originally drawn by German engineers, would take in American plants, but
                            that the turbine and equipment were desired as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>I emphasized that Rione’s statement forwarded in my despatch 946, May 10
                            did not appear to satisfy fully our inquiries with regard to the
                            relationship between the proposed contract and that between the
                            Uruguayan Government and the German syndicate particularly respecting
                            the continued presence of Germans on the project. The Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs informed me that he would clarify this matter in the
                            next few days in a memorandum.</p>
                        <p>Although the Uruguayan Government has indicated that it would be prepared
                            to consider the contract as a separate one to be completed by American
                            engineers it is not clear from the Department’s telegram whether this
                            assurance would be sufficient or whether the Department predicates its
                            assistance on the grounds that the entire contract be awarded to an
                            American company, thus eliminating German influence entirely. In any
                            case as suggested in my despatch the Legation believes that the
                            Department may desire to insist upon obtaining a copy of the original
                            contract with the German syndicate before making final decision.</p>

                        <p>195. My number 190, May 14, 6 p.m. Guani handed me last night a <hi
                                rend="italic">note verbale</hi> containing the promised memorandum
                            from Rione clarifying the relationship between the Uruguayan Government
                            and the German Consortium with regard to the Rio Negro Hydroelectric
                            Project. Although the Rione memorandum has already been sent to the
                            Uruguayan Minister in Washington for presentation to the Department, the
                            Legation is forwarding copies in today’s airmail pouch.<note n="72"

                        <p>The Department’s attention is especially invited to items 2 and 5 of the
                            Rione’s memorandum from which it is clear that while the proposed

                                xml:id="pg_600" facs="0608"/>equipment is considered a separate
                            contract the Rione does not contemplate the elimination of German
                            interests in other phases of the project and that in fact German
                            personnel will continue to work on the project.</p>

                        <p>88. Your 190, May 14, 6 p.m. The Department has not yet received the
                            second of the despatches mentioned and cannot, consequently, comment
                            fully. It is the Department’s view, however, that it would not be enough
                            for the Uruguayan Government to consider the proposed contract a
                            separate one to be completed by American engineers. The Department feels
                            that the German influence must be eliminated entirely.</p>
                        <p>The Department has the copy of the public contract with the German
                            syndicate which was published in the <hi rend="italic">Diario
                                Oficial</hi> of April 16, 1937, but it understands that there is in
                            addition a confidential contract. Please inform the Foreign Minister
                            that the Department would require copies of all contracts and
                            commitments entered into with the German syndicate before making final
                            decision.</p>

                        <p>200. Department’s telegram No. 88, May 17, 9 a.m. [<hi rend="italic"
                                >p.m.</hi>] Yesterday I again discussed with Guani the Rio Negro
                            Hydroelectric Project and informed him that the Department would require
                            copies of all contracts and commitments entered into with the German
                            Syndicate before making final decision. I said that although the
                            Department had not yet received my last two despatches especially the
                            one transmitting the memorandum<note n="73" xml:id="d505fn73">See first

                            relationship between the Uruguayan Government and the German Consortium,
                            the Department had indicated that it would not feel inclined to assist
                            in the matter until “German influence had been eliminated entirely.”</p>
                        <p>Guani said that if by “influence” the United States meant “participation”
                            what [it was] asking was in effect a total rescission of the German
                            contract and that although such a course was possible theoretically in
                            the case of “unreasonable delay” the German Government <pb n="601"
                                xml:id="pg_601" facs="0609"/>had already made clear what
                            interpretation is placed on the words “unreasonable delay” in the
                            cancellation clause and had made it known that a rescission of the
                            contract now would be considered by the German Government as a direct
                            affront—a step which Uruguay was obviously not prepared to
                            undertake.</p>
                        <p>The whole interview was friendly and although Guani professed that the
                            fulfillment of a separate contract by an American firm would not
                            materially assist the German interests, it was clear to me that he
                            realized that his arguments were not very forceful. In conclusion he
                            reiterated that the turbo generating equipment was of vital interest to
                            Uruguay, again expressing the hope that the Department might be disposed
                            to accept the Uruguayan Government’s contention that German influence
                            would be eliminated from the proposed American contract and to assist
                            Uruguay after it had had an opportunity to examine the memorandum

                        <p>97. Your 200, May 20, 6 p.m. The Department has received from the
                            Uruguayan Minister the memoranda of Rione and the Ministry of Foreign
                            Affairs. In order to consider the matter further this Government will
                            have to ascertain whether it will be possible in connection with our own
                            defense program to make this type of material available to Uruguay,
                            provided that proper agreement with respect to the German interests is
                            reached. In order to do this it is necessary to have exact information,
                            with particular reference to the hydraulic machinery, electrical
                            machinery, electrical implements and power line materials needed. The
                            information transmitted with your despatch no. 939 of May 7 refers only
                            to the weight in tons of the equipment. The Department in addition must
                            have full detailed specifications including the size and capacity of the
                            generators, the number of generators and turbines, and so forth. The
                            voluntary report on the hydroelectric project mailed May 18, 1939<note
                                n="74" xml:id="d506fn74">Not printed.</note> by the Consulate gives
                            certain incomplete technical specifications which may or may not have
                            been changed in the intervening 2 years.</p>
                        <p>The Department requests that you airmail immediately as full technical
                            specifications as possible, and that you telegraph at once the summary
                            specifications of the principal turbines, generators and other large
                            items required.</p>

                        <p>256. Department’s No. 97, May 27 [<hi rend="italic">24</hi>], 7 p.m. The
                            Minister of Foreign Affairs has just informed me that as a result of a
                            recent Cabinet decision as to the Rio Negro, administration was sending
                            Director General Luis Giorgi to the United States and that he will take
                            the specifications for machinery desired together with copies of the
                            contracts, agreements, et cetera. Giorgi expects to depart July 2 by
                            plane to Washington to be followed by an assistant, Juan Rezzano.</p>
                        <p>When I pointed out that my Government had indicated that it will not be
                            inclined to assist in the Project until German influence had been
                            eliminated, he said that he understood the situation and had made it
                            clear in the Cabinet meeting. He intimated that the Rione administration
                            was unable or unwilling to understand our views and that he had
                            therefore washed his hands of the matter allowing the representative of
                            the Rione administration to proceed to the United States to learn what
                            Guani tried to make clear to him here.</p>

                        <p>133. Your 256, June 20, 11 p.m. The Department has been discussing the
                            Rio Negro project with the Uruguayan Minister here and on June 7 gave
                            him an informal memorandum<note n="75" xml:id="d508fn75">Not
                                printed.</note> which he a few days later transmitted by airmail to
                            the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This memorandum made it clear that no
                            discussions could profitably take place unless it were clear that the
                            entire German influence was to be eliminated.</p>
                        <p>The Department at the same time indicated that it would be necessary to
                            devise some American consortium to undertake the work, and of course to
                            get priorities clearance. The latter matter is still under discussion
                            with the Office of Production Management, while Mr. Simmons of the
                            General Cable Company is informally considering the possibility of
                            getting together a suitable group to undertake the project.</p>
                        <p>There is no lack of technical information here, since Mr. Simmons has the
                            complete detailed specifications, and the discussion at this point is
                            entirely on a policy level.</p>
                        <pb n="603" xml:id="pg_603" facs="0611"/>
                        <p>It consequently would not appear necessary for any technicians to come
                            from Uruguay. While this Department will of course welcome the visit of
                            the Director of the Rione, it feels that his visit might more
                            opportunely be made later when the basic decisions have been taken and
                            when it would be appropriate to discuss matters of detail.</p>
                        <p>For your confidential information the Uruguayan Minister concurs in this
                            view.</p>

                            Foreign Affairs but orally to Señor Giorgi himself, Giorgi, who had
                            already made plans and who informed Chapin that he had intended to take
                            up other business in the United States, left on the Pan American plane
                            on the 12th via west coast and is proceeding directly to Washington.</p>

                        <p>322. President Baldomir sent for me yesterday to discuss various matters
                            including the pending request of the Uruguayan Government for equipment
                            to place the Rio Negro Project in partial operation. I explained our
                            position carefully with particular reference to the Department’s opinion
                            that the Uruguayan Government should abrogate that portion of the
                            present contract pertaining to generating equipment, et cetera. The
                            President said that he does not see how Uruguay could do so for the
                            following reasons: Clause 57 of the contract gives the contractors the
                            clear right to delay fulfillment in case of war. When the war broke out
                            the German Consortium had ready for shipment much of the generating
                            equipment for which the Uruguayan Government had already advanced over
                            4,000,000 pesos.</p>
                        <p>The President and his legal advisers are convinced that if Uruguay were
                            to cancel the contract the Consortium would demand repayment <pb n="604"
                                xml:id="pg_604" facs="0612"/>in full and probably damages, and that
                            any court of law would uphold the German claim. He estimates that
                            cancellation would expose Uruguay to eventual losses of from 15 to 20
                            million pesos. He intimated that rather than run such a risk it might be
                            better to suspend work entirely until after the war.</p>
                        <p>The President asked me specifically to inform the Department that nothing
                            in the contract contemplates any German participation or influence in
                            the operation of the project once it is completed. He said that Giorgi
                            has the contract in his possession in Washington.</p>
                        <p>For reasons already known to the Department the Uruguayan Government is
                            extremely desirous of placing the project in partial operation as soon
                            as practicable in view of an impending power shortage which will be
                            acute by the middle of 1943 or earlier. If we were disposed to furnish
                            the limited equipment requested (with proper guarantees of course for
                            the temporary elimination of all German influence) our action would I
                            believe assist the Uruguayan Government politically, contribute to a
                            long-range solution of the fuel and shipping problems, give us a
                            bargaining point which we could use to advantage, and help counteract
                            the impression encountered in official and business circles that Uruguay
                            has not been given all the consideration which it deserves in return for
                            its wholehearted support of our policies.</p>

                        <p>The Government of the United States has studied carefully the request of
                            the Government of Uruguay for assistance in the completion of the Rio
                            Negro hydroelectric project, in order to satisfy the urgent requirements
                            for electric power for the city of Montevideo. The Department of State
                            on June 7, 1941 handed the Uruguayan Minister an informal
                                memorandum,<note n="76" xml:id="d511fn76">Not printed.</note>
                            outlining the general basis on which discussion of such possible
                            assistance might go forward. Since that time a group of United States
                            companies has discussed in a preliminary way with technical
                            representatives of the Uruguayan Government and with the appropriate
                            agencies of the United States the technical and engineering aspects of
                            the problem, including, especially, possible delivery schedules for the
                            material which would be required, such schedules being considered in
                            relation to the requirements of <pb n="605" xml:id="pg_605" facs="0613"
                            />national defense. Such discussions have resulted in a tentative
                            understanding on a proposed schedule of delivery between the
                            manufacturers of the equipment and the appropriate agencies of the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>In view of the general progress which has been made in all of the
                            technical matters mentioned in the memorandum of June 7, 1941, the
                            Department is now in a position to submit the following bases for the
                            continued discussion of the request of the Uruguayan Government: <list>

                                <item>A United States consortium now being formed would undertake to

                                    be exported from the United States, to provide engineers to

                                    receiving substations, and accessory equipment and materials.
                                    The Uruguayan Government would undertake to supply all materials
                                    not exported from the United States and to install and erect
                                    under the supervision of the engineers supplied by the

                                    supplied by the consortium. Details of this undertaking would be

                                    States consortium. The United States consortium would undertake,
                                    with the approval of the appropriate agencies of the Government

                                Welles.</note> The General Staff has received secret information
                            recently which leads it to believe that some attempt may be made upon
                            the oil tanks or refineries in Aruba and Curaçao by Axis agents, either
                            by means of a raider disguised as a merchant vessel or by airplanes now
                            in German hands.</p>
                        <p>As a means of precaution, it considers that the best safeguard would be
                            the storage of airplane bombs in Maracaibo and either in La Guaira or in
                            some convenient place adjacent to La Guaira so that in the event of the
                            contingency above mentioned, planes could be sent speedily from the
                            Panama Canal to pick up the bombs at the places mentioned as a means of
                            defense against the acts of aggression above specified.</p>
                        <p>If the steps contemplated were taken, the General Staff would wish to
                            station, as custodian of the bombs to be stored, a skeleton company in
                            the two places mentioned. The plan would envisage the sending of these
                            two companies as technical instructors at the invitation of the
                            Venezuelan Government or as part of any military mission of instruction
                            which ostensibly might be desired by the Venezuelan Government.</p>
                        <p>Please take up this question in strict confidence at the earliest
                            opportunity with Dr. Gil Borges<note n="2" xml:id="d512fn2">Venezuelan
                                Minister for Foreign Affairs.</note> or, if he is not sufficiently

                        <p>8. For the Under Secretary. Your 8, January 19. This morning Dr. Gil
                            Borges informed me that after laying the matter in complete confidence
                            before the President the latter stated that skeleton companies could not
                            be stationed in Venezuela without congressional legislation authorizing
                            such a procedure. As an alternative the President suggested that the
                            United States [might] store the bombs on a suitable ship stationed at or
                            near the Isle de Aves about 60 miles east of Curaçao or the bombs might
                            be stored on this island in custody of the Venezuelan garrison
                            there.</p>
                        <p>In intimate conversation I was able to draw out from Gil Borges in
                            strictest confidence the fact that the real reason back of the
                            President’s reluctance was his conviction that the stationing of
                            American troops or other custodians in Venezuela would have a very bad
                            effect on the public opinion. The President stated that such a move
                            could not be kept secret and would be immediately seized upon by the
                            Germans or other hostile groups to create trouble. In this connection he
                            referred to complications such as had occurred in Uruguay. Dr. Gil
                            Borges added his opinion that the move would be premature at this time,
                            but that were the United States at war much more far-reaching measures
                            could be taken immediately and would be accepted by public opinion in
                            all quarters. He terminated by expressing the President’s desire to
                            cooperate with the United States in every possible way.</p>

                        <p>15. From the Under Secretary. Your no. 8, January 21, 4 p.m. In view of
                            the Venezuelan Government’s suggestion that bombs might be stored in its
                            territory, you will please inquire whether Venezuelan authorities would
                            consent to the stationing of two noncommissioned officers of the United
                            States Army at each place of storage. They would be instructed to
                            supervise construction of storage as well as measures adopted for
                            guarding the bombs and would be authorized to employ Venezuelan
                            civilians as guards.</p>
                        <p>They could also assist in training Venezuelan troops. This Government
                            would be glad to offer their services if so requested. It is believed
                                <pb n="609" xml:id="pg_609" facs="0617"/>that this might provide the
                            Venezuelan Government with a reasonable basis for justifying the
                            presence of these soldiers. [Welles.]</p>

                            of basic agreement for the lend-lease program of transferring military
                            matériel to Venezuela. The principal financial provisions are as
                            follows: Venezuela is to receive a total of $20,000,000 of war and navy
                            matériel of which it is expected $5,000,000 of army matériel and
                            $1,000,000 of navy matériel will be transferred during the fiscal year
                            ending June 30, 1942. This delivery date is subject to change if broad
                            defense considerations so require.</p>

                            fiscal year until 1947, making a total of $9,000,000 to be repaid prior
                            to June 30, 1947. In consideration of the broad objectives of the
                            program and of certain very general economic concepts, the entire
                            obligation of Venezuela to the United States would be considered
                            discharged by such payments.</p>

                        <p>Dr. Escalante<note n="9" xml:id="d517fn9">Diógenes Escalante, Venezuelan
                                Ambassador.</note> informed Mr. Berle<note n="10" xml:id="d517fn10"
                                >Adolf A. Berle, Jr., Assistant Secretary of State.</note> that his
                            Government in studying the Lend-Lease requirements of Venezuela had come
                            to the conclusion that a large expenditure of money for purely military
                            purposes was unjustified and not warranted, particularly since the
                            construction of a ring of bases from Trinidad to the Panama Canal
                            reduced to almost nothing the probability of the success of an attack on
                            Venezuelan shores by a foreign power. Escalante went on to say that the
                            economic strengthening and development of Venezuela would be its best
                            contribution to hemisphere defense.</p>
                        <p>He inquired, therefore, whether the United States Government could assist
                            Venezuela in developing the projects described below in place of and
                            under the same terms as military equipment under Lend-Lease. The
                            projects the Venezuelan Government has in mind are the following: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>Construction of roads, particularly in eastern Venezuela and a
                                    few in western Venezuela toward the Colombian frontier. The
                                    roads in eastern Venezuela would be designed to extend the
                                    network connecting the various oil fields in that region.</item>

                                    vessels could at all times call at river ports. At present, the
                                    navigable mouth silts up rapidly, frequently delaying traffic
                                    and preventing the use of the river by large ships.</item>

                                    would eventually form a part of a direct air system across

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Collado</hi>: Some time ago Mr. Berle asked me
                            to explore the possibility of acceding to Ambassador Escalante’s request
                            that the Lend-Lease arrangement with Venezuela be confined to the
                            canalization of the Orinoco, building of strategic roads and airports,
                            and so forth, rather than military equipment which Venezuela did not
                            need or want, especially as it considers that its defense will be amply
                            taken care of by the ring of bases in the Caribbean.</p>
                        <p>I understand that for legal and other considerations Lend-Lease funds
                            cannot be used in the manner suggested by the Venezuelan Government. Mr.
                            Berle will, I believe, wish to explain to Ambassador Escalante why the
                            suggestion of the Venezuelan Government cannot be entertained. Can you

                            airplanes and anti-aircraft guns and material which are urgently needed
                            to ward off attack which may be made on oil installations and airports.
                            He is convinced of the real danger of such attack and that it must be
                            anticipated. He stated that he has sufficient trained personnel if they
                            can be supplied with equipment.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With reference to my telegrams Nos. 301,
                            December 13, 2:00 p.m., and 322, December 22, 7:00 p.m., respectively, I
                            have the honor to report that as a result of my conversations with
                            officials in the oil industry and military and naval officers, both
                            Venezuelan and American, the possibilities to be guarded against in
                            adequately protecting the petroleum supply emanating from this country
                            are the following:</p>
                        <p>In Venezuela itself the danger of possible sabotage is an ever present
                            one, and to guard against this the oil companies have requested and
                            obtained special military protection for their various properties in
                            addition to the intensification of the protection facilities already
                            functioning. However, in addition there is the always present danger of
                            attack from the sea by air on the producing installations, in spite of
                            the risk to the enemy of being intercepted by the American patrol in the
                            Atlantic and being unable to escape after such an attack.</p>
                        <p>A danger greater than that which might result from an attack on producing
                            wells by sabotage or from the air arises in the possibility of an air or
                            submarine attack on the refineries at Aruba and Curaçao. Here it is
                            considered that danger from sabotage or from fifth column activity can
                            be dealt with, but there is particular apprehension concerning the
                            possibility of a submarine attack which might not only damage the
                            refineries but destroy all or a part of the fleet of tanks which furnish
                            the life line for the transportation of petroleum from Venezuelan ports
                            to Aruba and Curaçao. This danger is one which I consider should be
                            guarded against to the fullest extent possible with sufficient forces to
                            prevent any such eventuality. It is the opinion of some experts that a
                            submarine attack which would damage the refineries and put out of
                            commission the specially designed shallow draft tankers which ply
                            between Venezuela and the Dutch islands, could do the greatest damage
                            and is most to be feared.</p>
                        <pb n="614" xml:id="pg_614" facs="0622"/>
                        <p>There exists at present no adequate defense against such an attack, as
                            far as Venezuela is concerned, and it is urged that immediate steps be
                            taken to provide security for this vital industry.</p>
