                <head>About the Series</head>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents
                    the official documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and
                    significant diplomatic activity of the United States Government. The Historian
                    of the Department of State is charged with the responsibility for the
                    preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The staff of
                    the Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, under the direction of
                    the General Editor of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series,
                    plans, researches, compiles, and edits the volumes in the series. Secretary of
                    State Frank B. Kellogg first promulgated official regulations codifying specific
                    standards for the selection and editing of documents for the series on March 26,
                    1925. These regulations, with minor modifications, guided the series through
                    1991.</p>
                <p>Public Law 102–138, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, established a new
                    statutory charter for the preparation of the series, which was signed by
                    President George H.W. Bush on October 28, 1991. Section 198 of P.L. 102–138
                    added a new Title IV to the Department of State’s Basic Authorities Act of 1956
                    (22 U.S.C. 4351, et seq.).</p>
                <p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be
                    a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major United States foreign policy
                    decisions and significant United States diplomatic activity. The volumes of the
                    series should include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation
                    of major foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States Government.
                    The statute also confirms the editing principles established by Secretary
                    Kellogg: the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series is guided by the
                    principles of historical objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered
                    or deletions made without indicating in the published text that a deletion has
                    been made; the published record should omit no facts that were of major
                    importance in reaching a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the
                    purposes of concealing a defect in policy. The statute also requires that the
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be published not more than
                    30 years after the events recorded. The editors are convinced that this volume
                    meets all regulatory, statutory, and scholarly standards of selection and
                    editing.</p>

                    Series</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute requires that the published
                    record in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations </hi>series include all
                    records needed to provide comprehensive documentation of major U.S. foreign
                    policy decisions and significant U.S. diplomatic activity. It further requires
                    that government <pb n="IV" facs="0005" xml:id="pg_IV"/>agencies, departments,
                    and other entities of the U.S. Government engaged in foreign policy formulation,
                    execution, or support cooperate with the Department of State historians by
                    providing full and complete access to records pertinent to foreign policy
                    decisions and actions and by providing copies of selected records. Most of the
                    sources consulted in the preparation of this volume have been declassified and
                    are available for review at the National Archives and Records Administration
                    (Archives II), in College Park, Maryland.</p>
                <p>The editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series have complete
                    access to all the retired records and papers of the Department of State: the
                    central files of the Department; the special decentralized files (“lot files”)
                    of the Department at the bureau, office, and division levels; the files of the
                    Department’s Executive Secretariat, which contain the records of international
                    conferences and high-level official visits, correspondence with foreign leaders
                    by the President and Secretary of State, and the memoranda of conversations
                    between the President and the Secretary of State and foreign officials; and the
                    files of overseas diplomatic posts. All of the Department’s central files for
                    1977–1981 are available in electronic or microfilm formats at Archives II, and
                    may be accessed using the Access to Archival Databases (AAD) tool. Almost all of
                    the Department’s decentralized office files covering this period, which the
                    National Archives deems worthy of permanent retention, have been transferred to
                    or are in the process of being transferred from the Department’s custody to
                    Archives II.</p>
                <p>Research for <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes is undertaken
                    through special access to restricted documents at the Jimmy Carter Presidential
                    Library and other agencies. While all the material printed in this volume has
                    been declassified, some of it is extracted from still-classified documents. The
                    staff of the Carter Library is processing and declassifying many of the
                    documents used in this volume, but they may not be available in their entirety
                    at the time of publication. Presidential papers maintained and preserved at the
                    Carter Library include some of the most significant foreign-affairs related
                    documentation from White House offices, the Department of State, and other
                    federal agencies including the National Security Council, the Central
                    Intelligence Agency, the Department of Defense, and the Joint Chiefs of
                    Staff.</p>

                <p rend="sectiontitleital"> Editorial Methodology</p>
                <p>The documents in this volume are presented chronologically according to
                    Washington time. Memoranda of conversation are placed according to the time and
                    date of the conversation, rather than the date the memorandum was drafted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by
                    guidance <pb n="V" facs="0006" xml:id="pg_V"/>from the General Editor and the
                    Chief of the Editing and Publishing Division. The documents are reproduced as
                    exactly as possible, including marginalia or other notations, which are
                    described in the footnotes. Texts are transcribed and printed according to
                    accepted conventions for the publication of historical documents within the
                    limitations of modern typography. A heading has been supplied by the editors for
                    each document included in this volume. Spelling, capitalization, and punctuation
                    are retained as found in the original text, except that obvious typographical
                    errors are silently corrected. Other mistakes and omissions in documents are
                    corrected by bracketed insertions: a correction is set in italic type; an
                    addition in roman type. Words repeated in telegrams to avoid garbling or provide
                    emphasis are silently corrected. Words and phrases underlined in the source text
                    are printed in italics. Abbreviations and contractions are preserved as found in
                    the original text, and a list of abbreviations is included in the front matter
                    of each volume.</p>
                <p>Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate omitted text that deals with an
                    unrelated subject (in roman type) or that remains classified after
                    declassification review (in italic type). The amount and, where possible, the
                    nature of the material not declassified has been noted by indicating the number
                    of lines or pages of text that were omitted. Entire documents withheld for
                    declassification purposes have been accounted for and are listed with headings,
                    source notes, and number of pages not declassified in their chronological place.
                    All brackets that appear in the original text are so identified in footnotes.
                    All ellipses are in the original documents.</p>
                <p>The first footnote to each document indicates the source of the document,
                    original classification, distribution, and drafting information. This note also
                    provides the background of important documents and policies and indicates
                    whether the President or his major policy advisers read the document.</p>
                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not
                    printed in the volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources,
                    provide references to important related documents printed in other volumes,
                    describe key events, and provide summaries of and citations to public statements
                    that supplement and elucidate the printed documents. Information derived from
                    memoirs and other first-hand accounts has been used when appropriate to
                    supplement or explicate the official record.</p>
                <p>The numbers in the index refer to document numbers rather than to page
                    numbers.</p>

                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic
                    Documentation</p>
                <p>The Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation, established under
                    the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute, reviews records, <pb
                        n="VI" facs="0007" xml:id="pg_VI"/>advises, and makes recommendations
                    concerning the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The Advisory
                    Committee monitors the overall compilation and editorial process of the series
                    and advises on all aspects of the preparation and declassification of the
                    series. The Advisory Committee does not necessarily review the contents of
                    individual volumes in the series, but it makes recommendations on issues that
                    come to its attention and reviews volumes as it deems necessary to fulfill its
                    advisory and statutory obligations.</p>

                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Declassification Review</p>
                <p>The Office of Information Programs and Services, Bureau of Administration,
                    conducted the declassification review for the Department of State of the
                    documents published in this volume. The review was conducted in accordance with
                    the standards set forth in Executive Order 13526 on Classified National Security
                    Information and applicable laws.</p>
                <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information,
                    subject only to the current requirements of national security as embodied in law
                    and regulation. Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the
                    appropriate geographic and functional bureaus in the Department of State, other
                    concerned agencies of the U.S. Government, and the appropriate foreign
                    governments regarding specific documents of those governments. The
                    declassification review of this volume, which began in 2011 and was completed in
                    2012, resulted in the decision to withhold 3 documents in full, excise a
                    paragraph or more in 6 documents, and make minor excisions of less than a
                    paragraph in 20 documents.</p>
                <p>The Office of the Historian is confident, on the basis of the research conducted
                    in preparing this volume and as a result of the declassification review process
                    described above, that the documentation and editorial notes presented here
                    provide a thorough, accurate, and reliable—given the limitations of space—record
                    of the Carter administration’s policy toward the Eastern Mediterranean region,
                    Cyprus, Turkey, and Greece.</p>

                        Relations</hi> Series</p>
                <p>This volume is part of a <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> subseries that
                    documents the most important foreign policy issues of the administration of
                    Jimmy Carter. The focus of this volume is on U.S. policy towards Cyprus, Turkey,
                    and Greece. U.S. diplomacy in the Eastern Mediterranean region under President
                    Carter, however, was heavily influenced by dramatic events during the <persName
                        corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1"
                        >Ford</persName> administrations; in particular, the attempt by the Greek
                    military Junta to depose Cypriot leader Makarios III in July 1974 and the
                    subsequent Turkish invasion of Cyprus. The 1974 Cyprus crisis still posed a
                    daunting set of interrelated policy challenges two and a half years later.
                    First, the Turkish invasion created a violent de facto division of Cyprus
                    between its ethnic Greek and ethnic Turkish communities. Second, Greece, citing
                    the inability of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to prevent the
                    invasion, removed itself from the Alliance’s military structure. And third, the
                    U.S. Congress, in protest of the <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName>
                    administration’s perceived “tilt” toward Turkey in this dispute, imposed an arms
                    embargo on Turkey, which went into effect in February 1975. Readers who wish to
                    understand the broader context of the Carter administration’s Eastern
                    Mediterranean region policy, therefore, should consult <ref

                <p>This volume documents the major foreign policy decisions taken by the Carter
                    administration toward Cyprus, Turkey, and Greece. Documentation in this volume
                    includes memoranda; records of discussions within the U.S. policymaking
                    community as well as with foreign officials; cables to and from U.S. diplomatic
                    posts; and papers that set forth policy issues and options and that show
                    decisions or actions taken. The documentation emphasizes both the process by

                    behind the Carter administration’s approach to the Eastern Mediterranean region.
                    Unlike previous <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes on the subject,
                    this volume features a regional compilation on the <pb n="VIII" facs="0009"
                        xml:id="pg_VIII"/>Cyprus conflict. This editorial decision reflects the
                    strategic and political decision by the administration, at the outset, to
                    approach the division of Cyprus holistically as a complicated matrix of issues
                    involving not only Cyprus, Turkey, and Greece, but also the Greek and Turkish
                    Cypriot communities and their respective relations with their counterparts in
                    Athens and Ankara.</p>
                <p>The regional compilation features documentation on Carter’s prior commitment to
                    resolving the Cyprus conflict. As a candidate for President, Governor Carter and
                    his principal foreign policy advisers, Cyrus Vance and Zbigniew Brzezinski, saw
                    in the region an opportunity to draw a sharp distinction between what they
                    perceived as the <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> administration’s
                    failed approach of “tilting” toward Turkey and downplaying the human rights
                    violations that occurred as a result of the Turkish invasion. Carter’s critique
                    of <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName>’s policy aligned him with those
                    in Congress who supported the arms embargo on Turkey. Carter pledged that, if
                    elected President, he would put renewed focus on the region through high-level
                    diplomacy.</p>
                <p>The memoranda and reports contained in the regional compilation show the Carter
                    administration grappling with the Cyprus issue in strictly multilateral terms.
                    This regional coverage, however, has its limitations. The vast majority of
                    Embassy cable traffic, as well as records of bilateral meetings between U.S.
                    officials and their counterparts, are in the country compilations. Furthermore,
                    toward the end of the administration, when it became clear that Carter’s initial
                    goal of reunifying Cyprus would not succeed, U.S. officials resorted to a more
                    bilateral approach in Greece and Turkey, while at the same time decreasing
                    Washington’s profile in the ongoing negotiations between Greek and Turkish
                    Cypriots. As a result, the regional compilation is “top heavy.” As the
                    administration’s multilateral approach became less intense, there was less
                    corresponding documentation.</p>
                <p>As with the regional compilation, most of the documents in the bilateral Cyprus
                    compilation date from the administration’s first two years. Carter and his
                    advisers initially viewed a Cyprus settlement and reunification of the Greek and
                    Turkish Cypriot communities as pivotal to defusing tensions between Greece and
                    Turkey; consequently, the administration focused much of its initial efforts on
                    Cyprus. The documents in this compilation demonstrate that the interests of the
                    Greek and Turkish Cypriots did not always align with their respective
                    counterparts in Athens and Ankara. This divergence, along with the largely
                    irreconcilable negotiating postures among the leaders of both Cypriot
                    communities, effectively brought the prospects of a full settlement to a halt by
                    the end of 1977. Although Carter and his advisers continued to advocate a
                    settlement and push for the United Nations to take an increasingly active role
                    in negotiations, the momentum required to achieve a breakthrough was largely
                    lost by early 1978.</p>
                <pb n="IX" facs="0010" xml:id="pg_IX"/>
                <p>The compilation on Turkey includes documentation on the administration’s decision
                    in 1978—despite lack of progress on Cyprus—to press Congress to overturn the
                    arms embargo on Turkey. Many U.S. officials concluded that the embargo had taken
                    a serious toll on Turkey’s defense posture—the ramifications of which affected
                    not only Turkey itself but NATO as a whole—and that, in turn, U.S.-Turkish
                    relations were rapidly deteriorating. Members of Congress who had advocated
                    linking a Cyprus settlement to the arms embargo argued that Carter had broken
                    his campaign promise. Citing high-level efforts to forge a settlement, the
                    administration—notably, Paul Henze of the National Security Council
                    Staff—countered that, without abandoning its goals for Cyprus, U.S. interests in
                    the Eastern Mediterranean region were broader than the island stalemate. The
                    White House lobbying campaign paid off: in the summer of 1978, both houses of
                    Congress voted to overturn the arms embargo on Turkey, thus improving
                    U.S.-Turkish relations and addressing concerns for the viability of NATO.</p>
                <p>The principal focus in the compilation on Greece is the Carter administration’s
                    efforts to reintegrate the Greek military into the NATO command structure. In
                    light of the administration’s de facto de-linking of Cyprus from the arms
                    embargo on Turkey, this proved to be no easy task. While Greek leaders gradually
                    de-emphasized the role of Cyprus in U.S.-Greek relations, Athens was unwavering
                    in its insistence that Washington maintain the arms embargo on Turkey. Greece
                    insisted that not only would lifting the embargo make Turkey more intransigent
                    on Cyprus, but also that the ethnic Turkish community in Cyprus was much less
                    independent of Turkey than Ankara claimed. As the documents in this compilation
                    demonstrate, Greek concerns were rooted more deeply in strategic concerns
                    relating to the military competition and territorial disputes in the Aegean Sea
                    with Turkey. Athens argued that lifting the arms embargo would make Turkey more
                    likely to engage in regional adventurism. In October 1980, after a protracted
                    series of negotiations on the command and control structure of Greek and Turkish
                    forces in the Aegean, Greece—with the support of the new military government in
                    Turkey, which took power in a coup the previous month—agreed to rejoin the
                    military structure of NATO, on the condition that a NATO commander would direct
                    Greek and Turkish forces on a case-by-case basis.</p>

                    1977–1980, Volume XXI, Cyprus; Turkey; Greece</p>
                <p>In preparation for this volume, the editors made extensive use primarily of
                    Presidential materials held in the Jimmy Carter Presidential Library and
                    Department of State materials held in the National Archives and Records
                    Administration (Archives II) in College Park, Maryland. Of the Presidential
                    materials, several collections proved to be particularly valuable for this
                    volume. The 1977 Transition File contains a number of documents that detail how
                    Governor Carter developed his policy toward the Eastern Mediterranean as a
                    Presidential candidate. These documents provide a blueprint for Carter’s
                    subsequent policies during his first year in office, and they also serve as a
                    baseline to illustrate the extent to which the Carter administration reversed
                    course once it had determined that a full negotiated settlement in Cyprus was
                    out of reach. The National Security Affairs, Brzezinski Material, Country File
                    for Cyprus, Turkey, and Greece is an excellent resource for many of the most
                    important policy meetings on the Eastern Mediterranean region as well as
                    miscellaneous but important documents pertaining to each country. The National
                    Security Council, Institutional Files contain many of the NSC’s key meetings
                    regarding policy toward the region. The National Security Affairs, Brzezinski
                    Material, Subject File is generally the best source for memoranda of
                    conversation between U.S. officials and their foreign counterparts. Finally, the
                    National Security Affairs, Staff Material, Horn/Special File, containing
                    memoranda from National Security Council Staff member Paul Henze to Assistant to
                    the President for National Security Affairs Zbigniew Brzezinski, is an
                    indispensable resource for understanding how the Carter administration
                    eventually pursued policies that were more closely aligned with those of the
                        <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> administration than with
                    Carter’s own pledges first as a candidate for President and then during his
                    first year in office.</p>
                <p>Several collections originating in the Department of State and now housed at
                    Archives II also proved extremely valuable for this volume. The Central Foreign
                    Policy File is a repository for telegrams between the Department of State and
                    U.S. diplomatic posts. Because of the multilateral nature of the issues in the
                    Eastern Mediterranean, the cable traffic to, from, and among the Embassies in
                    Nicosia, Ankara, and Athens is vital to understand Cypriot, Turkish, and Greek
                    responses to U.S. policy. The lot file containing the records of Secretary of
                    State <pb n="XIV" facs="0015" xml:id="pg_XIV"/>Cyrus Vance is a rich repository
                    of key memoranda of conversation between Vance and the leading political figures
                    of the region. The records of Deputy Secretary of State Warren Christopher (much
                    of which was already declassified at the time of research) proved important
                    particularly when he was serving as Acting Secretary of State. Finally, it would
                    not have been possible to document the diplomatic challenges of the Cyprus
                    impasse without the records of Department of State Counselor Matthew Nimetz.
                    Nimetz, who served as the Department’s point person on Cyprus, was involved in
                    nearly every aspect of U.S. efforts to achieve a settlement between the ethnic
                    Greek and ethnic Turkish communities of Cyprus, both as a direct mediator and as
                    a partner to UN Secretary General Kurt Waldheim. The files of Matthew Nimetz and
                    Paul Henze demonstrate the real and sometimes mutually exclusive choices
                    confronted by the Carter administration and provide valuable insight in
                    assessing the overall policy of the administration toward Cyprus, Turkey, and
                    Greece. They also document the enormous influence that can be exerted by
                    relatively unknown U.S. officials in the foreign policy establishment.</p>
                <p>Because intelligence-gathering and analysis did not play a large role in the
                    formulation of U.S. policy toward Cyprus, Greece, and Turkey, documentation
                    originating in the Central Intelligence Agency is not prominently featured in
                    this volume. Still, a number of documents from the CIA’s National Intelligence
                    Council Files provide key insights into the political and tactical calculations
                    of the leaders of Cyprus, Greece, and Turkey. Finally, the Department of Defense
                    took a leading negotiation position with regard to efforts to reintegrate Greece
                    into the military structure of NATO. Documents housed at the Washington National
                    Records Center provided key memoranda between Department of Defense officials
                    and their counterparts in Greece in the successful effort to reintegrate Greece
                    and thus bring NATO back to its state before the war in Cyprus in 1974.</p>

                        </opener>
                        <p>While we touched on the national security issue at our lunch the other
                            day, we failed to discuss a challenge <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1"
                                >Ford</persName> can present in debate which best exposes the
                            mutually exclusive goals we recommend for Governor <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>, i.e., win over the
                            Greek-Americans while guarding against alienating the Turks. This
                            challenge would come in the form of a question designed to elicit the
                            Governor’s specific position on the Defense Cooperation Agreement with
                            Turkey. The question might be phrased as follows:</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> has acknowledged
                            the great importance of Turkey to the security of the United States. My
                            Administration, after months of negotiation, has concluded an agreement
                            with that <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> ally that will enable
                            the United States to reopen our vital intelligence bases, and to assure
                            the integrity of <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>’s southern
                            flank. The Democratic Congress has refused even to consider this
                            agreement thereby further damaging our relations with Turkey and setting
                            back our efforts to gain a Cyprus settlement. I think it is vitally
                            important to know whether Governor <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                >Carter</persName> will support the implementation of this agreement
                            if he becomes President, or whether he is willing to precipitate a
                            crisis with Turkey that could leave our country badly weakened in the
                            eastern Mediterranean.</p>
                        <p>The Demirel government, which has steadfastly maintained its pro-West
                            outlook, has banked its prestige on its agreement with the <pb n="2"
                                facs="0035" xml:id="pg_2"/>United States. The four-year agreement
                            was designed to satisfy the Turkish demand for a “Congress-proof” pact.
                            It has significantly alleviated political pressure on Demirel, though
                            the State Department argues that he is becoming increasingly nervous
                            over congressional inaction as his government approaches an election
                            year.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, although the signing of a new arms agreement with Turkey at
                            this time ignores the will of Congress and seems a poor prescription for
                            a tense situation, the failure to implement the agreement will
                            undoubtedly elicit a strong Turkish reaction. Turkey could close our
                            bases permanently and/or drop out of the military arm of <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> (though, like Greece, maintaining
                            its membership in the political council).</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>’s outright
                            rejection of the agreement will significantly compromise his ability to
                            deal with Turkey later. And, if he embraces it in any way,
                            Greek-Americans will be offended.</p>
                        <p>My recommendation is that Governor <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                >Carter</persName> use the opening to recount the failure of the
                                <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName>/<persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> policy on Cyprus and the
                            Administration’s inability to work with Congress in designing a foreign
                            policy that deserves public support. The Governor should stress that his
                            Administration will provide an opportunity for a fresh look at the
                            Cyprus problem—a complex problem involving both humanitarian and
                            security considerations.<note n="2" xml:id="d1fn2">An unknown hand, most

                            an agreement which, if implemented in the absence of a similar agreement
                            for Greece, would have badly distorted the balance of military power in
                            the eastern Mediterranean. (If the agreement with Greece is submitted
                            before the end of this session of Congress, the same argument can be
                            used but with the added point that there was no time to carefully
                            consider the implications of both agreements.)</p>
                        <p>The Governor should then assert that it would be improper for a
                            prospective President to comment on whether any particular international
                            agreement—particularly one not yet approved by Congress—would comport
                            with whatever policy a future Administration might adopt.</p>
                        <p>Finally, Zbig, let me say this: I recognize that the foregoing may be a
                            bit too detailed insofar as setting forth the essence of a sound
                            position for Governor <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> to
                            have in his mind in a national debate. Frankly, this position was
                            devised as a response to a specific question which may not be
                            forthcoming. As a general proposition, I think <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> might be better off sticking to
                            the following fundamentals on Cyprus:</p>
                        <p>1.) The <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>/<persName
                                corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> Cyprus policy has been an
                            unmitigated disaster, alienating Cyprus, Greece, and Turkey
                            simultaneously!</p>
                        <p>2.) As President he will instruct his new Secretary of State to give
                            priority attention to the matter and to use the influence and good
                            offices of the United States to work with all the interested
                            parties.</p>
                        <p>3.) That a solution on Cyprus, like it or not, is intertwined (avoiding
                            the code word “linked”) with other disputes between Greece and Turkey
                            (e.g. Aegean oil).</p>
                        <p>4.) A fresh approach by a fresh Administration might work. The old
                            approach by the old Administration will be simply more of the same and
                            is doomed to failure.<note n="5" xml:id="d1fn5">In the margin, an

                        <p>1. In 1967, the United States determined that it was in its interest and
                            that of world peace to play an active part in attempting to prevent a
                            war between Greece and Turkey over Cyprus, and in assisting the parties
                            to resolve their differences. To this end, President <persName

                            assist in mediating the potential conflict. In carrying out this

                            immediately flew to Ankara and then shuttled back and forth between
                            Athens and Ankara in an attempt to ascertain the essential demands of
                            the parties. This was done in an even-handed fashion without any tilt
                            toward either of the parties. After receiving a full bill of particulars
                            from both sides, <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> prepared
                            four points of proposed agreement which, in his judgment, met the
                            essential demands of the parties and gave them a face-saving formula
                            under which each could draw back from the brink. With minor
                            modifications, both countries agreed to these points. Thereupon,

                            neither country (especially Greece, the weaker) wants war between them.

                            wobbly American policy in 1974 undoubtedly gave Turkey some
                            encouragement when it decided to seize and occupy a major part of
                            Cyprus, with consequences that will continue to be an issue in 1977.</p>
                        <p>Both Greece and Turkey, especially the latter, are relatively poor
                            countries by European standards and seek fuller economic integration
                            with Europe. Better relations between them could hasten this process by
                            enabling them to focus more resources on development.</p>
                        <p>The essence of the matter is that the United States, <gloss

                            Mediterranean have a very strong interest in getting stability in the
                            area.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_BJ_1">Brademas</persName> began by telling Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> that the Congressmen
                            were concerned about rumors that he was under pressure from the outgoing
                            administration to allow the Turkish <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>
                            to go forward to the Congress in early January. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> said that no pressures had been
                            applied, but that he had been asked whether he would object to such a
                            move. <persName corresp="#p_BJ_1">Brademas</persName> responded that it
                            would be an “extremely dangerous mistake” to resubmit the <gloss
                                target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> to Congress immediately despite the
                            view held by the “career people at State” that a Democratic President
                            will be better able to influence the Democratic Congress on this issue.
                            He added that it would be “disastrous” to have an immediate confronta<pb
                                n="7" facs="0040" xml:id="pg_7"/>tion on the <gloss
                                target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> and that Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> should do what he can to avoid
                            being “squeezed” between the outgoing administration and Congress.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SPS_1">Sarbanes</persName> said that Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> had considerable “running room”
                            on this issue as long as he allowed it to lie dormant for awhile.
                            Sending the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> up to Congress now
                            would place the issue “front and center” and force hostile Democratic
                            Congressmen to respond negatively. Delaying its submission to Congress
                            could be explained by the need to review all multi-year arms supply
                            agreements, including the Greek <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>
                            which has not yet been concluded.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BJ_1">Brademas</persName> said that it would be a
                            mistake to assume that the conclusion of a <gloss target="#t_DCA_1"
                                >DCA</gloss> agreement with Greece would satisfy Congress and allow
                            passage of the Turkish <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> as long as
                            there was no progress on Cyprus. He added that the two <gloss
                                target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>’s raised important budgetary
                            questions: should the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> pay $1.7
                            billion to two <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> allies? <persName
                                corresp="#p_SPS_1">Sarbanes</persName> mentioned that delaying
                            submission of the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> would signal to
                            the Congress that the new administration is rethinking its policies in
                            the area, without interrupting the flow of arms to Turkey that is now
                            proceeding. <persName corresp="#p_BJ_1">Brademas</persName> said that he
                            strongly supported allowing $170 million in <gloss target="#t_FMS_1"
                                >FMS</gloss> to go to Ankara despite Turkish “colonization” of much
                            of Cyprus, a move that will shortly be condemned by the Council of
                            Europe. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> then pointed
                            out that Greece had also been guilty of violations of neutrality in the
                            area.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RBS_1">Rosenthal</persName> stated that the new
                            administration’s position on Cyprus should be based on consultation with
                            those who have opposed the current State Department position, and Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> replied that he very
                            much wanted Congressional input on this and other issues. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RBS_1">Rosenthal</persName> continued that submission of
                            the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> would be an “offensive act,”
                            and that Governor <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> and Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> should “stop
                            everything” and “put the machine in neutral.” They should rethink the
                            Cyprus problem from scratch, change American ambassadors to the three
                            concerned countries, and send a fact-finder to visit the area. No <gloss
                                target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>’s should be submitted until the Cyprus
                            question is resolved and the new administration comes up with sweeping
                            new policies on how to regulate <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            arms sales worldwide which are now totalling $11–12 billion a year.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> then indicated that if
                            he advised Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>
                            against submitting the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> now, the
                            current administration would hold it back. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> added that he might well proceed
                            to change some of the American ambassadors in the area.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BJ_1">Brademas</persName> commented that <persName
                                corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName> is likely to be much more
                            flexible on the terms of a settlement with the new American
                            administration, and that he had clear and persuasive evidence to this
                            effect. <persName corresp="#p_SPS_1">Sarbanes</persName> said that a
                            Cyprus settlement is possible now, and that Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> had much more “running room” on
                            the issue than did Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_RBS_1"
                                >Rosenthal</persName> added that if Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1"
                                >Vance</persName> tells the Congress that certain <pb n="8"
                                facs="0041" xml:id="pg_8"/>parties are acting unreasonably in the
                            Cyprus dispute, he will be believed in a way that Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> was not.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BJ_1">Brademas</persName> asserted that the
                            Turkish General Staff will compromise on Cyprus but that Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> had never really
                            pushed the Turks. When Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> showed the Department’s reporting cables from
                            Ankara to <persName corresp="#p_BJ_1">Brademas</persName>, it was
                            obvious to him that no real pressure had been applied on Ankara.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BJ_1">Brademas</persName> stated that he fully
                            recognized the need to keep Turkey in <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_SPS_1">Sarbanes</persName>
                            suggested that the West Europeans—especially the Germans and
                            Italians—could be helpful in mediating the Cyprus dispute. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RBS_1">Rosenthal</persName> pledged that the Congressmen
                            would “keep quiet” until the new administration had put together a
                            “package” on Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> then offered to share
                            his thinking on the issue with the Congressmen. He read the text of the
                            five Cyprus principles that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> had wanted to offer to the interested parties
                            as a basis for negotiation, and that had been approved by the members of
                            the European Community.<note n="2" xml:id="d3fn2">

                                corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> that the political situation in
                            Turkey was still very tense with public opinion highly inflamed on the
                            Cyprus issue. The <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> was very
                            important to Turkey, and failure to pass it would drastically reduce
                            American leverage in Ankara although the Turks would not leave <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> if rebuffed. <persName
                                corresp="#p_TI_1">Turkmen</persName> said that the Turkish military
                            was not dictating the government’s Cyprus policies, although the
                            generals did determine the size of the Turkish forces that were needed
                            for the portion of Cyprus being occupied. If the <gloss
                                target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> were passed, Turkey would move ahead
                            on Cyprus. <persName corresp="#p_TI_1">Turkmen</persName> added that he
                            was fairly optimistic that the talks between Greece and Turkey on the
                            Aegean would make some progress. The representatives of the Cypriot
                            Government who had sought out Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1"
                                >Vance</persName> were much more specific. They had come with a map
                            of the island with proposed divisions between the two communities and
                            had stated that their views must be taken into account, warning that no
                            settlement should be negotiated over their heads.</p>

                        <p>The Congressmen replied that they saw the present Cyprus situation much
                            in the same way as Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SPS_1">Sarbanes</persName> expressed regret
                            that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> had
                            turned down a proposal that Senator <persName corresp="#p_ETF_1"
                                >Eagleton</persName> and then Secretary of Defense <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJR_1">Schlesinger</persName> had discussed which would
                            have involved a “step-by-step” plan beginning with President <persName
                                corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> exercising his waiver rights to
                            allow up to $100 million to go to Turkey despite the imposition by
                            Congress of an arms embargo.<note n="4" xml:id="d3fn4">The waiver rights
                                formulation was discussed in a conversation among <persName

                                    >Kissinger</persName>, and several members of Congress in June
                                1975. See <ref target="frus1969-76v30#d228">

                            Following this move Ankara would have allowed some Greek refugees to
                            return to Turkish-occupied territory. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> argued that the Turks
                            rejected this formula, but <persName corresp="#p_SPS_1"
                                >Sarbanes</persName> expressed the view that Ankara was never really
                            urged by the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> to accept it. He said
                            that it may no longer be possible to work out a “step-by-step” scenario
                            in the Cyprus dispute.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> conveyed his view that
                            Turkey was prepared to compromise, but that a way must be found to
                            permit Ankara to change its position without appearing to be forced into
                            backing down publicly. The Congressmen agreed and said that they “have
                            the same problem.” Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>
                            pointed out <persName corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName>’ resistance
                            to sign anything that recognized a bi-zonal Cyprus. The Congressmen then
                            disagreed among themselves about whether it was clear that <persName
                                corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName> is prepared to be more
                            flexible.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SPS_1">Sarbanes</persName> said that if Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> sent an emissary to
                            Greece, Turkey and Cyprus who came back and convinced Congress of the
                            worth of a new set of proposals to end the dispute, the Congress would
                            then bring “pressure” on <persName corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName>
                            and <persName corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName>, help enlist the
                            support of the West Europeans, and vote sufficient aid funds to sweeten
                            the package. <persName corresp="#p_SPS_1">Sarbanes</persName> added that
                            “time is not on <persName corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName>’ side.”
                                <persName corresp="#p_RBS_1">Rosenthal</persName> commented that Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> brought with him
                            “fresh air, objectivity, credibility” and that Congress would cooperate
                            in effecting a settlement that leave each of the three interested
                            parties “somewhat unhappy.” He added the view that the Turks are also
                            looking for a way out, since they do not want to be ostracized by
                            Western Europe and the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> The Turkish
                            economy is faring poorly and outside help is needed. Turkey does not
                            want to have to occupy Cyprus forever.</p>
                        <p>The Congressmen then summarized their views:</p>
                        <p>1. Nothing should be done on the Cyprus issue in the coming weeks that
                            would force confrontation between the Congress and the administration;
                            and</p>
                        <p>2. The new administration should announce that it is taking a new look at
                            the problem, name new American ambassadors in the region, <pb n="10"
                                facs="0043" xml:id="pg_10"/>and send an emissary to the three
                            contending countries while working quietly behind the scenes to prepare
                            a solution.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> replied that he had
                            already been considering the advisability of sending an emissary to
                            visit the area in order to study the Cyprus problem. The most difficult
                            problem would be determining how much territory will remain under
                            Turkish control. The interested parties, not the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss>, should supply proposals for a division of the island
                            between the two communities, and then proceed to negotiate together.
                                <persName corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName> nevertheless remains
                            a problem. The West Europeans could be helpful, but it is still
                            uncertain how rapidly a solution can be worked out.</p>

                        <p>The President has directed that the Policy Review Committee undertake,
                            under the chairmanship of the Department of State, a review of Cyprus
                            and the situation in the Aegean. This review should assess our interests
                            and objectives, and the possibilities for moving toward a peaceful
                            solution of both disputes, in light of the new Administration’s

                        <p>The review should:</p>
                        <p>1. Provide a State/<gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> assessment of the
                            current positions of the principal parties—the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
                            leaders, the Greek, Turkish and Cypriot Governments. The assessment
                            should include what each expects of the United States in the near term.
                            It should evaluate the domestic pressures each faces, and discuss the
                            possibility that those pressures will lead to defined developments
                            affecting particular American strategic interests in Greece and Turkey.
                            It should also describe the relationship between the Cyprus question and
                            the disputes over the Aegean continental shelf and air space.</p>
                        <p>2. Examine the components of a Cyprus settlement: territorial
                            adjustments, form of government, economic requirements, and guarantees,
                            including the role of the United Nations or other outside powers.
                            (State)</p>
                        <p>3. Analyze alternatives available to the United States in order to
                            promote a settlement, likely reactions of the parties, kinds of American
                            commitments required, and implications for the mid-term. (State,
                            Defense)</p>
                        <p>4. Assess, as a special feature of alternative strategies, the two
                            Defense Cooperation Agreements with Greece and Turkey, and the bearing
                            of those agreements on the Cyprus and Aegean disputes. (State, Defense,
                                <gloss target="#t_JCS_1">JCS</gloss>)</p>
                        <p>5. Review the possibilities for involving our European allies in the
                            process of settling the disputes, including assessments of various forms
                            of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-European cooperation and/or
                            types of negotiating forums. (State)</p>
                        <p>6. Review the state of Congressional and public opinion toward the Cyprus
                            question and the two base agreements, and suggest, as an integral part
                            of our diplomatic approach, strategies for dealing with Congress and the

                            (by <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>) of how things stand

                                >Knoche</persName>:</hi> (On Turkey) Our main concern is Turkey;
                            elections are scheduled for next October; if the internal situation
                            deteriorates, it is likely the military may intervene; there is internal
                            disorder, particularly student disorder; at this moment, the chances are
                            less than 50–50 that the military will intervene before the <persName

                                personal emissary to undertake a mission to Greece, Cyprus, and

                            Also we should keep in mind that the pattern of military intervention in
                            Turkish do<pb n="13" facs="0046" xml:id="pg_13"/>mestic politics is one
                            of imposing martial law for a time until order is reestablished and then
                            withdrawing rather than taking over, becoming the government. There is a
                            kind of “democratic tradition” in Turkish military intervention in
                            domestic affairs. So, such intervention, should it occur, would not
                            embarrass the <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName>

                                in Nicosia.</note> The meeting was held on Turkish initiative after

                            announced; it was probably a move designed to make the Turkish-Cypriot
                            leadership look good before <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1"

                        <p>The Turkish Cypriot position defines the territory to be held by Turkey
                            between 30–33%; the Greek-Cypriot position, no more than 20%. Somewhere
                            between this 20% and this 30–33% is the room for maneuver and
                            compromise.</p>
                        <p>(On Aegean) Tension remains. The Greeks insist on their exclusive right
                            to the seabed. However, Turkey feels the stronger party; they have the
                            upper hand in Cyprus and it will be difficult . . . there will be
                            trouble if they are asked to move away from this position of
                            strength.</p>

                            Turkish and Cypriot ambassadors, and with Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_TSM_1">Turner</persName>. These are my conclusions:</p>
                        <p>Congress is saying that unless there is action on Cyprus there will be no
                            action on Turkish <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>; there is a
                            distinct reluctance to go along <pb n="15" facs="0048" xml:id="pg_15"
                            />even with part-time or halfway measures. Even the military aid
                            currently given to Turkey is under close questioning. On the other hand,
                            the view of the Turkish Ambassador is that “if the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> links Cyprus to the <gloss
                                target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> you’ll get nowhere.” A complete
                            separation is requested.</p>
                        <p>Turkey, up to now, had the feeling that the executive branch was
                            sympathetic to its outlook; it (Turkey) felt it could pretty much ignore
                            Congress, not be bound by its action. I have attempted to indicate
                            clearly to the Turkish Ambassador that this is a new deal; that times
                            have changed; that there is a Democratic President and a Democratic
                            majority, and that the Congress and the Administration will move
                            together . . .</p>

                            I expect good cooperation from the Greeks. <persName corresp="#p_DR_1"

                        <p>The problems of a Cyprus settlement are many:</p>

                        <p>If we can get an understanding on basic principle, an agreement to come
                            back with, we can perhaps go to Congress with this and ask them to go

                                settlement of the Cyprus dispute. The first option reads: “If the

                                    >U.S.</gloss> initiative on Cyprus and the European Community
                                continues to want to work closely with us, we should make a major

                                communities.” The second option reads: “If one or more of the

                            issue: is it wise to focus so heavily and directly on the Cyprus issue
                            itself? Ought we not to consider, not a new line, but a somewhat
                            different focus for this mission? As stated now, there is the danger
                            that the <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> mission could
                            be perceived as a <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> mediation effort
                            on Cyprus. Should we not consider the alternative of focusing on the
                            general Greek-Turkish relationship as such . . . <pb n="17" facs="0050"

                            the question becomes what do you say as you get off the plane in Athens,
                            then in Ankara . . . In Athens the emphasis should be placed on US-Greek
                            relations; if the question of Cyprus comes up, fine, discuss it in
                            private meetings. In Ankara, I will emphasize my defense background and
                            the long-standing US-Turkish defense relationship with reference to
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>, our bases, etc. I intend to
                            make no mention of Cyprus at all. However, when I talk privately with
                            Demirel I can say “Mr. Prime Min<pb n="18" facs="0051" xml:id="pg_18"
                            />ister, it is up to you: do you want to help us with the problem we
                            have with Congress?”</p>
                        <p>We can lay off Cyprus; but in the last analysis in addition to furthering
                            relations with two important allies, it is progress in Cyprus that
                            interests Congress; in fact, Congress is shockingly uninterested in
                            long-term Greek-US and Turkish-US relationship.</p>

                            improve Greco-Turkish relations so that within that climate the Cyprus
                            question can be resolved.</p>

                            has no real economic significance for Turkey; it has no military

                            can diminish this emotional factor and set Cyprus within the framework
                            of the factors that are of much greater importance to Turkey—military

                            Turks 30–33%; then someone within that range will have to say “this is
                            the line.” They will not do it themselves. Neither wants to give way to
                            the other.</p>

                            the Nine can help, the English and French have indicated a desire to

                            Turkish feeling that for the past two years we have been putting it to
                            them. It is very unlikely that they will be in a mood for any
                            concessions. There is a strong feeling of injustice felt particularly by
                            the military people.</p>

                            Turkey is the problem. They are deeply aggrieved by what they consider
                            our improper, infamous actions in the past. But we have to convince them
                            that this is a new deal, that they and we should find a way to be of
                            benefit to them. I hope that by the third day I would be successful in
                            changing their attitude.</p>

                            Turks have accomplished their objectives in Cyprus: they are protecting

                        <p>All agreed that Turkey is the key to the current problem. It deeply
                            resents the arms embargo and Congress’ failure to approve the Defense
                            Cooperation Agreement. Turkey bridles at any attempt to link
                            Congressional passage of the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> or
                            military aid to Turkish concessions on Cyprus. At the same time, the
                            attitude in Congress remains stiff: if there is no Turkish movement on
                            Cyprus, Congress may not approve the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1"

                            reported that many in Congress are surprisingly insensitive to the

                            <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName>’s mission will be
                            exploratory in nature, an effort to improve the climate for negotiations
                            in the region, not to seek final solutions. However, the mission will be
                            an important shaper of the tone of future American policy and how it is
                            perceived. Cyprus is the Congressional problem, all agreed, but there
                            were differences about what that meant for immediate strategy. Several
                            suggested that there is no way to avoid confronting the Cyprus problem
                            early and directly, with the considerable American involvement in
                            negotiating a solution. Others, however, worried that too much focus on
                            Cyprus, rather than on more general Greek-Turkish relations, would make
                            the entire process hostage to the Cypriot leaders, especially <persName

                            progress on Cyprus is possible. The maximum objective would be to return
                            with enough evidence of Turkish flexibility on Cyprus to induce Congress

                            All agreed, however, that the chance of that is practically nil. It

                        <p>1. The President outlined his understanding of the current situation: we
                            need the bases in Greece and Turkey. There is a strong Greek-American
                            political force that must be recognized. There may be some feeling in
                            Turkey that the President is biased towards Greece. The President noted
                            the progress made in the intercommunal talks under <pb n="23"

                                UN, which commenced in January 1975, see <hi rend="italic">Yearbook
                                    of the United Nations, 1975</hi>, pp. 273–277. Talks continued
                                intermittently over the next two years with Greek and Turkish

                                tensions between the two communities had quieted over the previous
                                several months, although the fundamental problems arising from the
                                conflict in 1974 remained unresolved. (<hi rend="italic">Yearbook of
                                    the United Nations, 1976</hi>, pp. 296–297)</note> He also noted
                            the leverage provided by West Germany’s relationship with Turkey, and he
                            indicated that <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> should
                            see <persName corresp="#p_SH_3">Schmidt</persName> if he thought it
                            useful.</p>
                        <p>2. The President said we want to let Greece and Turkey know we are
                            prepared to help but will not intrude. We need a Greek <gloss

                            Turkey. There will be no public link between Cyprus and the <gloss

                            wise and timely, though it is unlikely to result in a major
                            breakthrough. He described his discussions with Congress and emphasized
                            the apparent impasse between Congress and the Turks over passage of the
                                <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>. He suggested that the

                            development, are unlikely to result in a settlement without pressure
                            from Greece and Turkey.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> indicated that the
                            United States is not too popular in Greece. He felt the Greeks might be
                            prepared to give up their <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> if that
                            would prevent the Turks from obtaining theirs.</p>
                        <p>5. In Turkey, <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> said he
                            would emphasize that the situation has changed from the previous
                            Administration. Congress and the Executive will work together. He will
                            say explicitly that we want the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> to
                            pass, but that we will need help from the Turks.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> indicated we have no
                            plan to take to the area. After the trip, however, we should have a
                            better sense of the situation, the constraints, and the possibilities
                            for movement. If that enables us to develop a plan about how to proceed,
                            perhaps that plan should be passed to the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>
                            concurred in the outline of <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1"
                                >Clifford</persName>’s strategy. It seems sensible to him to try to
                            solve the Cyprus issue by improving relations between ourselves and
                            Greece and Turkey, and between the two of them, rather than through a
                            head-on approach.</p>
                        <p>7. In closing, <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> indicated
                            the deadline imposed by Congressional action on the budget. The
                                <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> budget contains $250
                            million in Turkish aid. This Administration will have to make its
                            intentions known about that aid, perhaps as early as late March.</p>

                        <p>The mission you assigned to me and my associates has proved to be a
                            fascinating one and we are gratified that progress was made in the
                            various areas of concern that the United States has felt over
                            developments in the Eastern Mediterranean.</p>
                        <p>There was assigned to me an unusually able and experienced staff. Messrs.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName>, <persName
                                corresp="#p_LNC_1">Ledsky</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_TGF_1"
                                >Treverton</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HRF_1"
                                >Hopper</persName> made an invaluable contribution to the mission.
                            We had team strategy sessions before going to each country and reached
                            agreement as to the proper approach to be employed. The United States
                            Ambassadors and their staffs in the countries we visited also made
                            important contributions to our efforts and fully participated in our
                            discussions.</p>
                        <p>In analyzing the conversation that you and I had, plus the briefings that
                            I received at the State Department and from the National Security
                            Council, I felt that you had given me four assignments:</p>
                        <p>1. Gather the facts regarding the problems of the Eastern Mediterranean
                            and get the attitudes of the various leaders of Greece, Turkey and
                            Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>2. Begin making a preliminary effort to lessen tensions that exist
                            between Greece and Turkey over the Aegean.</p>
                        <p>3. Search for ways to improve the bilateral relationships that exist
                            between the United States and Greece and the United States and
                            Turkey.</p>
                        <p>4. Ascertain what contribution, if any, the United States could make
                            toward obtaining progress in the solution of the bitter dispute in
                            Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>In an assignment of this kind, my experience leads me to believe that one
                            of the first orders of business is to ascertain where the pressure
                            points are. What leverage do we have on the various parties that we can
                            properly utilize to pursuade them to make a contribution toward peace in
                            the area? To illustrate: it was already clear before we left Washington
                            that if the question of the settlement of the Cyprus question were left
                            solely to the two Cypriot communities, there was virtually no chance <pb
                                n="25" facs="0058" xml:id="pg_25"/>that progress would be made. For
                            two and a half years the parties have scarcely been talking. United
                            Nations machinery has been ineffective in getting the parties to
                            negotiate seriously. Some new effort was clearly needed.</p>
                        <p>I shall now address myself to the four assignments that you gave us.</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Gather the facts and obtain the attitudes of the
                                leaders.</hi> We have learned a great deal about the area. Our
                            meetings in the various countries were with the heads of government and
                            their senior advisers, as well as with Secretary General <persName
                                corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName>. In each country we visited,
                            I held several private conversations with the national leader, and as a
                            team we held lengthy substantive discussions on major issues of concern
                            with the foreign ministers, defense ministers and senior officials. As
                            personal relationships were developed, the talks became franker and more
                            forthright. By the time we left each country we had a clear picture of
                            the attitude of each government and the personalities of the men who
                            were involved. We not only directed our inquiries to the governments now
                            in office, but in each instance had excellent meetings with opposition
                            leaders. This resulted in the acquisition of much valuable information
                            that will be useful to us in the future. Appended to this report is a
                            chronology of our meetings and general summary reports of our
                            discussions in each country we visited. We have also attached memoranda
                            of conversations prepared with respect to certain particularly important
                            meetings.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Make an effort to lessen the tension in the
                                Aegean.</hi> I believe we all received the clear impression that the
                            dispute between Greece and Turkey in the Aegean could result in an
                            incident leading to confrontation or even war. Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName> lectured us with intense
                            feeling on his perception of Turkish expansionism in the Aegean. The
                            controversies between Greece and Turkey center upon the following: (a)
                            questions regarding the continental shelf in the Aegean; (b) the air
                            control zone over the Aegean; (c) the boundaries of territorial waters;
                            (d) militarization of certain Greek islands contrary to treaty
                            obligations; and (e) the creation of a Turkish amphibious military force
                            along the Aegean coast.</p>
                        <p>We noted with care Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_CC_1"
                                >Caramanlis</persName>’ points and presented them to the Turkish
                            Government. Turkish officials went to great length to explain the
                            Turkish position in each instance and argued vehemently that Turkey was
                            not expansionist.</p>
                        <p>I believe that this discussion had a number of benefits. It acquainted
                            Turkey with the intensity of <persName corresp="#p_CC_1"
                                >Caramanlis</persName>’ feeling about these Aegean problems. It may
                            persuade both sides to negotiate more seriously during the forthcoming
                            round of continental shelf talks in Paris. The expression of our deep
                            concern about possible incidents may re<pb n="26" facs="0059"
                                xml:id="pg_26"/>duce the risk of unilateral research operations by
                            Turkey in sensitive disputed areas of the Aegean, but it should be noted
                            that we received no assurance in this regard. Turkey has been made aware
                            of our deep concern about difficulties in the Aegean and of our opinion
                            that hostilities between the two countries would mean an immediate
                            cessation of US arms flow to the area. We should build upon this
                            understanding in Turkey to discuss the Aegean issues more forthrightly
                            with the Greek Government with a view to encouraging substantive
                            negotiations and avoiding unfortunate incidents.</p>

                            received in the area, as was the knowledge that the new United States
                            Administration was reviewing its policies in the Eastern
                            Mediterranean.</p>
                        <p>Lengthy and valuable conversations were held on a range of bilateral
                            issues. Both Greece and Turkey are dissatisfied with their relationships
                            with the United States and we gave them full opportunity to air all
                            their grievances. There is now a better understanding on the part of
                            these nations regarding the attitude of the United States.</p>
                        <p>For a considerable period of time the Greeks have taken a relaxed
                            attitude toward resuming negotiations regarding the US-Greek Defense
                            Cooperation Agreement. During our discussions we pressed them to set a
                            date for resumption of the talks. On the last day of our stay in Athens,
                            the Foreign Minister informed us that he had been instructed by
                                <persName corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName> to say that by the
                            middle of March the Greeks would have a team ready to negotiate. In our
                            discussions with the Greeks about their <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss> relationship, we obtained their fundamental support
                            for a gradual reintegration in <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>’s
                            military wing, but we believe this will proceed slowly until the Cyprus
                            and Aegean issues are closer to solution.</p>
                        <p>We discussed United States-Turkish bilateral relations at some length in
                            Ankara, and we believe the Turkish leaders now understand as never
                            before that improved relations depend on movement in Cyprus. However, we
                            emphasized, publicly and privately, our desire <pb n="27" facs="0060"

                                States could make to getting progress in the solution of the bitter
                                dispute in Cyprus.</hi> This is the toughest nut of them all to
                            crack. The parties operate within a framework of a long history of
                            bitterness, recrimination and intercommunal violence. We all recognized
                            that this was the problem that would take the greatest efforts if any
                            concrete commitments were to be obtained.</p>
                        <p>Our strategy began in Turkey. We informed the Turks flatly that there was
                            no chance that the United States Congress would pass a Defense
                            Cooperation Agreement with the Turkish Government until substantial
                            continuing progress was made in Cyprus. The Turks repeated their
                            long-standing objection to linking the defense agreement with Cyprus and
                            said that they felt they had been treated very unfairly by the United
                            States Congress and in fact had been humiliated by the imposition of the
                            embargo. They believe they have a strong legal case and a strong moral
                            case for their intervention in Cyprus. As the talks progressed, however,
                            they became more realistic. The Turks were finally convinced that it did
                            them no good to rail at the Congress, but that if they wished to improve
                            their position with the United States in the defense field, they would
                            have to make a substantial contribution to the solution of the Cyprus
                            question.</p>
                        <p>Late on the last day of our visit in Ankara, the Foreign Minister
                            informed us that, after intense deliberations, his government would give
                            us its commitment that the Turkish Cypriot negotiator would place upon
                            the table, at the March 31 Vienna intercommunal talks, a concrete and
                            reasonable proposal for the constitutional structure of a new government
                            in Cyprus. They also agreed to serious and sustained negotiations in the
                            future.</p>
                        <p>We consider this Turkish commitment to be an important step forward. The
                            parties have talked intermittently at each other for some time but each
                            has refused to make written proposals or to talk seriously about
                            substance. We made no reciprocal United States commitment in response to
                            this decision other than to say that the Turkish action would have a
                            favorable impact upon our policy review, and that we would seek to
                            obtain a reciprocal territorial proposal from Archbishop <persName
                                corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName>.</p>
                        <p>After this forward step in Ankara, we proceeded to Cyprus for conferences
                            with Archbishop <persName corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName> and the
                            Turkish leader, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName>. I
                            had two lengthy visits with Archbishop <persName corresp="#p_M3_1"
                                >Makarios</persName>. Our team decided on the strategy that
                                <persName corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName> must be told that
                            United States interest in Cyprus, while at the present time at a high
                            level, is <pb n="28" facs="0061" xml:id="pg_28"/>fairly certain to
                            decline. <persName corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName> was told that
                            if a settlement in Cyprus was not reached during this year, he could
                            expect the United States interest to decline to the point where his
                            bargaining posture would deteriorate substantially. In addition, we told
                                <persName corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName> that our concern
                            over our bilateral relationship with Turkey and the condition of the
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> alliance was such that we
                            could not endanger those relationships much longer by using whatever
                            leverage we had to obtain the cooperation of other nations in working
                            toward a settlement in Cyprus. Noting the great importance of the
                            territorial issue to the Greek Cypriots, we suggested that the most
                            valuable contribution that <persName corresp="#p_M3_1"
                                >Makarios</persName> could make would be for him to agree to place
                            upon the table a specific proposal covering the division of
                            territory.</p>
                        <p>The impact of this argument on <persName corresp="#p_M3_1"
                                >Makarios</persName> was profound. At our second meeting, he was
                            more forthcoming and stated that he had reached the decision to place
                            upon the table in Vienna on March 31 a map which would recognize the
                            principle of bizonality (a concession he has never before made directly
                            to the Turks), and would provide for a 20% Turkish zone. Such a proposal
                            would form the basis of the negotiations over the territorial division
                            in a federal state between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots.
                            Furthermore, <persName corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName> and his
                            Foreign Minister promised to engage in sustained negotiations and
                            indicated they would welcome continued help from the United States.</p>
                        <p>The conference with the Turkish Cypriot leader, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName>, was the most difficult of all
                            because he resented the pressure toward a settlement he was receiving
                            from the Turks and further resented the fact that there was nothing he
                            could do about it. However, <persName corresp="#p_DR_1"
                                >Denktash</persName> and his Turkish Cypriot associates did confirm
                            that they would present a written constitutional proposal in Vienna. In
                            addition, <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> did agree that
                            serious and sustained negotiations would be undertaken.</p>
                        <p>The negotiations between Greek and Turkish Cypriots will continue to take
                            place under United Nations auspices, and we assured Secretary General
                                <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> that our
                            involvement was in no way in competition with his prominent role.
                                <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName>, however, is eager
                            for our assistance and support. Now that the parties are committed to
                            submit concrete, responsible proposals (the Turks on constitutional
                            arrangements and the Greeks on territorial division) and to negotiate
                            responsibly, a supportive role in encouraging further progress seems
                            appropriate for the United States.</p>
                        <p>A supportive role for the British and perhaps other European powers may
                            also be helpful at an appropriate time. We discussed the Cyprus part of
                            our mission in detail with Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_OD_1"
                                >Owen</persName> in London at the conclusion of our travels. The
                            British are guarantors, along with Greece and Turkey, of the 1960 Cyprus
                            constitution and also retain two sovereign base areas on the island
                            which we believe to be of <pb n="29" facs="0062" xml:id="pg_29"/>great
                            value to the United States and Western Europe and to the present

                                of Greece, Turkey, and the United Kingdom signed an agreement on

                                each country guarantor status to ensure the independence and
                                territorial integrity of Cyprus. (Department of State <hi

                                leading to Cypriot independence on August 16, 1960. The United
                                Kingdom retained sovereignty over two military bases on the

                            visit next week, for they have been seeking to reduce their commitments
                            on Cyprus. This concerns us. Both the Turkish leaders and <persName
                                corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName> explicitly requested that the
                            other Europeans not be brought into the detailed Cyprus negotiations at
                            this time, and we have honored their request in our discussions with the
                            British.</p>
                        <p>No one can guarantee that once the negotiations between Greek and Turkish
                            Cypriots actually begin in Vienna, the parties will act in good faith.
                            Each has, however, been given the clear impression that if the proposal
                            each presents is merely formal, or is plainly unreasonable, and if
                            substantive negotiations do not ensue, that fact will not be lost upon
                            us.</p>
                        <p>The only way that <persName corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> can reach agreement
                            will be under the continued leverage that has now been introduced and
                            that must be continued, certainly during the balance of this year. We
                            believe that this leverage can be successful because both the Turkish
                            and the Cypriot leaders now understand that they have more to gain from
                            making a serious effort to seek a solution through the creation of a
                            unitary, bizonal, federal state on Cyprus then to remain intransigent
                            and inflexible and risk United States displeasure.</p>
                        <p>The interest displayed by the President of the United States in the
                            Eastern Mediterranean, in itself, has had a profound impact upon the
                            area. Everyone took note of the fact that you chose in the first month
                            of your new term to give such important attention to the problems of
                            that area and that you were seriously reviewing United States policies
                            in the region. The nations involved would like to establish a good
                            working relationship with the new Administration, and we emphasized the
                            fact that the next eight-year period of the <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                >Carter</persName> Administration would be extremely critical for
                            their political, military and economic interests.</p>
                        <p>We have a delicate task in the future to relax certain restrictions
                            regarding Turkey, to strengthen relationships with Greece without
                            incurring Turkish displeasure, and at the same time to maintain
                            sufficient leverage to obtain their continued interest in assisting in
                            the settlement of the Cyprus question. We believe that this task is well
                            worth undertaking to further the important interests of the United
                            States in strengthening the southern flank of <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendations</p>
                        <p>On the basis of the facts we have gathered, the efforts we have made, and
                            the progress already achieved in improving United States relations with
                            the countries of the Eastern Mediterranean, we believe that our policies
                            in the months ahead should be directed toward the following ends:</p>
                        <p>1. Given the importance we attach to <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss>, the rebuilding of its Southeastern flank, and our own
                            bilateral security relationship with Turkey, as well as the positive
                            attitude we encountered in Ankara, we recommend that at an early date
                            the Administration endorse in principle the United States-Turkish
                            Defense Cooperation Agreement which has already been submitted to
                            Congress. This endorsement should be coupled, however, with an
                            indication that the Administration will not press for Congressional
                            approval of this agreement at this time. It would be understood that the
                            Administration would take an active role in seeking enactment of the
                                <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> only after substantial progress
                            has been made toward achieving a Cyprus settlement, which we believe can
                            occur in 1977.</p>
                        <p>2. We recommend, as an interim measure, that you request Congress to
                            enact legislation for <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1978 that will
                            permit foreign military sales to Turkey, as well as <gloss
                                target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> financing of $175 million, through
                            credits or guaranties. This recommendation to Congress could be coupled
                            with a request to selected <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> allies
                            that they provide additional military equipment which Turkey needs to
                            fulfill <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> commitments. We believe
                            this positive approach to Turkish military needs would be appreciated in
                            Ankara, but would not be seen in Greece or Cyprus as inimical to their
                            interests.</p>
                        <p>3. We strongly believe that the United States must continue to play an
                            active role in the Cyprus negotiating process. This role should be
                            supportive of United Nations Secretary General <persName
                                corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName>, and closely coordinated with
                            our principal European allies.</p>
                        <p>4. Especially with respect to Cyprus, we consider it important that
                            between now and the resumption of intercommunal negotiations in Vienna
                            on March 31, our efforts be directed to ensuring that Greek Cypriot
                            proposals on territory, and Turkish Cypriot proposals on a future Cyprus
                            constitution, be sufficiently realistic and constructive as to form the
                            basis for sustained negotiations. Assistance to the parties might also
                            be necessary in connection with the meetings, so as to avoid the
                            procedural breakdowns that have occurred in the past. We should maintain
                            a supportive role with the parties to the intercommunal talks, to
                            encourage a sustained negotiating tempo. This will probably entail <pb
                                n="31" facs="0064" xml:id="pg_31"/>maintaining effective leverage on
                            Turkey, Cyprus and Greece to make the reasonable concessions and
                            accommodations that will be essential.</p>
                        <p>5. Further with respect to Cyprus, we recommend that you ask the Congress
                            to appropriate assistance funds to be made available once the two
                            Cypriot communities reach a settlement. The funds would be designed for
                            reconstruction and development of the island and would be apportioned on
                            a fair basis so that both the Greek and Turkish zones would benefit.</p>
                        <p>6. A strong effort should be made to persuade the British to retain their
                            two important sovereign base areas on Cyprus. As a last resort, some
                            United States financial support for these bases may be necessary, but we
                            need not decide upon any such arrangement before consultations with the
                            British on this subject are held. Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJ_2">Callaghan</persName> will very likely have a
                            request in this regard when he talks with you in Washington next
                            week.</p>
                        <p>7. With respect to Greece, we believe it is important to resume talks as
                            soon as possible to conclude a United States-Greek Defense Cooperation
                            Agreement. We must anticipate, however, that the Greek Government may
                            move slowly since it has little incentive to conclude the agreement
                            until it is convinced that your Administration will recommend
                            Congressional approval of the United States-Turkish Defense Cooperation
                            Agreement.</p>
                        <p>8. To preserve and rebuild the Southeastern flank of <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>, we recommend continuing to work for
                            the reintroduction of Greece into the military wing of <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> as early as possible. We should
                            pursue this goal through the alliance structure and with our individual
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> partners.</p>
                        <p>9. The Aegean controversy between Greece and Turkey is potentially the
                            most explosive dispute in the Eastern Mediterranean. We do not believe
                            that our Government’s own views on the complex underlying issues are as
                            yet clearly formed. Accordingly, we propose that a comprehensive study
                            of Aegean issues be undertaken under the leadership of the Secretary of
                            State and that once firm conclusions are rendered, both Greece and
                            Turkey be counseled as to our conclusions and asked whether we might be
                            of further assistance in resolving Aegean difficulties. Until this study
                            is completed, we recommend that the United States steer an even-handed
                            course and refrain from giving the Greek Government the type of written
                            security guarantee that it is seeking from us. Instead, we should
                            continue to tell both the Greeks and the Turks of our strong desire that
                            these complex issues be resolved by substantive negotiation between them
                            or by mutually agreed upon third-party procedures.</p>
                        <p>I wish to express my gratitude to the President for this opportunity to
                            serve in this important area of international concern.</p>

                                    >Makarios</persName> and Turkish Cypriot leader <persName

                            <p>
                                <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> thanked the
                                Secretary General for making time available on his busy schedule,
                                and noted how valuable <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1"
                                    >Waldheim</persName>’s personal views would be to the US team
                                which was just beginning a trip to the Eastern Mediterranean.
                                Nuances which <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> could
                                provide of the meeting last weekend in Nicosia would be of great
                                value.</p>
                            <p>
                                <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> described the
                                meeting in Nicosia in a positive fashion. While noting that no
                                solution could be expected soon, he said he was pleased that things
                                were moving again. A new spirit was visible in Cyprus. Both
                                    <persName corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName> and <persName
                                    corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> seemed interested in
                                making progress and were now prepared to discuss substantive issues
                                in a way that had been impossible before. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> said <persName
                                    corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName> in particular appeared
                                anxious to negotiate, and while the verbal exchange between
                                    <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> and <persName
                                    corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName> had been extremely tough,
                                the atmosphere between the two was friendly throughout most of their
                                long four-hour meeting together.</p>
                            <p>
                                <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> then reviewed in
                                some detail the background of each of the four principles which had
                                been agreed upon, principles which he described as “sufficiently
                                clear” to offer a basis for subsequent negotiations. The key word in
                                the first principle, according to <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1"
                                    >Waldheim</persName>, was “bicommunal”. Use of this word allowed
                                    <persName corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName> to keep his
                                options open, although <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1"
                                    >Waldheim</persName> conceded that <persName corresp="#p_DR_1"
                                    >Denktash</persName> had made it adamantly clear that no
                                solution other than a bi-zonal one was possible.</p>
                            <pb n="33" facs="0066" xml:id="pg_33"/>
                            <p>
                                <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> said that there had
                                been an endless discussion of the second principle which dealt with
                                territory. The Turks had repeated their earlier figure of 32.8 or 20
                                percent. <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> said it
                                was his personal feeling on the basis of this and earlier
                                discussions that an eventual settlement somewhere between 25 and 27
                                percent was obtainable. As for the third point, <persName
                                    corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> said that <persName
                                    corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> had made it clear that
                                “freedom of settlement” could be no more than a statement of
                                principle. The phrase “certain practical difficulties” in this
                                principle was shorthand for Turkish security considerations.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> said there had
                                been general agreement in discussion of the fourth principle that
                                foreign affairs, defense and finance would be among those powers
                                reserved to the central government.</p>
                            <p>
                                <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> said that with
                                respect to subsequent negotiations, he had in mind convening
                                intercommunal talks in Vienna on March 30, or March 31. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> would stay in Vienna only
                                for the first four or five days, and then turn the negotiations over
                                to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DCJP_1">De Cuellar</persName>.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> said he hoped
                                this next round would last four to five weeks, and that a final
                                solution to the Cyprus problem could be achieved before the end of
                                1977. <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> cited two
                                reasons for the “breakthrough” which resulted in agreement to resume
                                the intercommunal talks. The first was Greek understanding that
                                support by the international community, as expressed through a
                                succession of US [<hi rend="italic">
                                    <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                                </hi>] resolutions, had provided no real basis for movement toward a
                                Cyprus settlement. The second reason was Turkish recognition that
                                despite their power on the ground, no international recognition for
                                the new Turkish status on Cyprus was possible without a negotiated
                                settlement. <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> said he
                                had no doubt also that Turkish desire to have the United States
                                approve the US-Turkish base agreement also had played an important
                                role in getting Ankara to be more flexible.</p>
                            <p>
                                <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> expressed his
                                appreciation to <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> for
                                his description and analysis. He explained briefly the nature of his
                                own mission to the area, putting emphasis on the US desire to begin
                                a resolution of the bilateral difficulties we faced in both Greece
                                and Turkey. He noted that our real interest centered on these
                                bilateral security questions though we recognize that continuing
                                difficulties in Cyprus prevented early progress in solving them.</p>
                            <p>With respect to Cyprus, <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1"
                                    >Clifford</persName> emphasized US interest in having the <gloss

                                contribute in any way we could to this <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                    >UN</gloss> effort. Our preference was to adopt and maintain a
                                low profile. We felt this was not only in our interest, but also
                                better for the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> as well. In this

                                <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> expressed
                                appreciation for this offer of US assistance. He agreed that the US
                                had a vital role to play, particularly through the contacts we have
                                and the influence we can exert in Ankara and Athens. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> noted that US and <gloss
                                    target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> efforts could and should be
                                complementary. The key to movement on Cyprus lay in Ankara, and it
                                was here that <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName>
                                thought we could be of most assistance. The territorial issue was
                                central for the Greek Cypriots, and US influence would be most
                                welcome in getting the Turks to show flexibility in this area.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> noted at the
                                same time that this could not come from direct US pressure, since
                                the Turks resisted any form of direct linkage of their <gloss

                                <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> thanked <persName

                                noted again that we did not wish to take a leading role in Cyprus
                                ourselves, but to contribute to maintaining the momentum which had
                                been established through the initiative of <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                    >UN</gloss> Secretary General <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1"
                                    >Waldheim</persName>. We wanted to help in any way we could. In

                                suggested that <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> pass
                                to the US any request he had for our assistance in moving the
                                parties closer to an agreement.</p>
                            <p>
                                <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> thanked Secretary

                                to the Cyprus problem could only come about through the kind of
                                complementary action by the US and the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                    >UN</gloss> which had been discussed. It was agreed that we
                                would work together in the months ahead, in an effort to move the
                                Cyprus negotiations as quickly and constructively as possible toward
                                a successful solution.</p>

                            <p>The Greeks presented their positions clearly and with great force.
                                These positions were not unlike those expressed in the past, but
                                there was a new sense of urgency and pessimism, especially in the
                                way Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName>
                                outlined his current problems. Greek leaders clearly appreciated the
                                chance to present their views to the President’s personal
                                emissary.</p>
                            <p>The major impression the Greeks wanted us to have was that Turkey had
                                become over the past two years a fundamentally expansionist power,
                                and that Turkish expansionism was aimed directly at Greece. The
                                Greeks cited as evidence of this:</p>
                            <p>A. Turkey’s second offensive in Cyprus in August 1974, and Turkish
                                failure to negotiate in Cyprus in good faith on the territorial
                                issue.</p>
                            <p>B. Disputes relating to the air zone over the Aegean.</p>
                            <p>C. Disputes over the Aegean continental shelf.</p>
                            <p>D. Other so-called Turkish provocative acts and statements.</p>
                            <p>In all their presentations, the Greeks stressed that the fault for
                                all their current problems lay with Turkey. The Greeks insisted they
                                were moderate and conciliatory, ready for negotiations and
                                compromise. All progress, however, was blocked because of Turkey’s
                                basically expansionist orientation. Thus, there was an air of
                                pessimism in every position. The Prime Minister stated with the
                                utmost seriousness that he would no longer be able to follow a
                                policy of moderation regarding Turkish provocations. He stated that
                                Greece could be humiliated no longer because the Greek people would
                                not stand for it. As an illustration, he stated flatly that if the
                                Turks sent out an exploratory ship again, <pb n="36" facs="0069"
                                    xml:id="pg_36"/>Greece could no longer rely on diplomacy. With
                                considerable emotion he informed us that the continuance of the
                                present Turkish attitude, in his opinion, would lead to war between
                                the two countries.</p>
                            <p>With reference to individual issues, the Greek positions can be
                                summarized as follows:</p>
                            <p>A. We requested the Greeks to set a date for resumption of base
                                negotiations. At formal meetings they were evasive. However, at our
                                final lunch, the Foreign Minister stated that the Prime Minister had
                                agreed to our request. He indicated an announcement to this effect
                                will not be made until after the <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1"
                                    >Clifford</persName> party leaves, ostensibly because of Greek
                                domestic sensitivities, but also possibly because the Greeks are
                                waiting to see what position the <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1"
                                    >Clifford</persName> party will take with respect to the Turkish
                                Defense Cooperation Agreement. We agreed to a delay in the Greek
                                announcement, and we expect the negotiations to resume either in
                                Washington or Athens on or about March 15.</p>
                            <p>B. While Greek officials acknowledged that the position on the
                                Turkish <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> was fully a matter
                                solely for the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> to decide, both
                                    <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName> and <persName
                                    corresp="#p_BD_2">Bitsios</persName> expressed a “private” view
                                that <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> military aid to Turkey
                                should not be resumed until after a settlement of both the Cyprus
                                issue and Greek-Turkish difficulties in the Aegean. This latter
                                condition, which would link the resumption of Turkish military aid
                                to resolution of the Aegean problem, constitutes a new and more
                                rigid Greek position. The Greeks did suggest that both base
                                agreements might be completed and ratified, but that the respective
                                aid packages should be separated from the general documents.</p>
                            <p>C. With respect to <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>, the Greeks
                                indicated they were in favor of the Alliance and wanted to move back
                                towards full membership. But until there was progress on Cyprus and
                                the Aegean, this re-entry would have to take a slow and measured
                                pace, and therefore had to be organized on the basis of a special

                            <p>D. The Greeks refrained from giving an indication of how the <gloss
                                    target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> might be of assistance in
                                facilitating a Cyprus settlement, although we put the question
                                directly several times. The Greeks made clear that they themselves
                                could not adopt an active role at present, but would continue to be
                                helpful behind the scenes. The Greeks maintained that <persName
                                    corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName> was now reasonable and
                                wanted to negotiate and that therefore our most important service
                                would be to press the Turks to make a reasonable territorial
                                proposal. The Greeks, however, were not optimistic about the
                                prospects for forthcoming intercommunal talks in Vienna in
                                March.</p>
                            <p>The Greek Foreign Minister asked that the <persName

                                carefully in the Government’s review of policies in this area.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> expressed the
                                view that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> wishes to promote
                                a strong <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>, to restore good
                                    <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> relations with both Greece
                                and Turkey, and to help Greece and Turkey resolve their
                                differences.</p>
                            <p>Greek leaders expressed throughout their presentations their strong
                                fears of Turkish intentions, including possible ultimate threats
                                against the Greek islands in the Aegean. At the same time the
                                Greeks, while insisting they were moderate, seemed to have no idea
                                as to how they might resolve their problems with Turkey themselves.
                                While talking of further negotiations they appeared to have no plan
                                as to how to proceed, and they seem to have prepared no substantive
                                proposals of their own, particularly with respect to the Aegean
                                question which they claim is the most dangerous.</p>
                            <p>Greek moderation indeed appears based on a realization of Greece’s
                                fundamental weaknesses vis-a-vis Turkey. Nonetheless, the Prime
                                Minister emphasized that hostilities between the two countries might
                                occur and that he might not be able to restrain the Greek military
                                and populace if what Greeks fear is Turkish provocation continues
                                (such as seismic research operations by the Turks in the Aegean this
                                spring and summer).</p>

                            <p>These meetings were long, intensive and frank. Throughout <persName

                                <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> told the Turkish
                                leaders the following: Our Government believed in a strong
                                US-Turkish relationship; we believed it to be in our interest and in
                                Turkey’s interest to maintain and strengthen the <gloss
                                    target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> relationship; it was the basic
                                desire of the United States Government to promote the defense
                                cooperation agreement that had been signed; the attitude of our
                                Congress was largely unchanged; and discernible improvement in the
                                Cyprus situation was necessary if the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1"
                                    >DCA</gloss> was to be pushed to enactment by the
                                Administration. The United States and Turkey should be partners in a
                                process of strengthening our relationship and getting the <gloss
                                    target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> enacted. Turkey’s role in the
                                partnership must be to encourage substantial progress in the Cyprus
                                negotiations. We recognized Turkish sensitivities about linking
                                Cyprus to the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> and also the
                                potential impact of this issue in their forthcoming election.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> made no public
                                mention of any Cyprus/DCA link, and seldom referred publicly to
                                Cyprus at all.</p>
                            <p>
                                <hi rend="italic">Turkish Response.</hi> The Turkish leaders
                                expressed great concern about the arms embargo and the need for
                                Congressional approval of the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>.
                                They described their long association as a trusted <gloss
                                    target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> ally; the long history of Cyprus
                                which has no clear rights or wrongs; and emphasized that an arms
                                embargo was not a proper way to treat an ally. This presentation of
                                the Turkish position was generally mild and was not coupled with any
                                threat to pull out of <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> or to
                                permit the US-Turkish relationship to deteriorate. On the contrary,
                                the Turks seemed—in private, of course—to accept the fact that
                                Cyprus and the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> are in reality
                                linked at least in the eyes of the Congress. With respect to Cyprus,
                                the Turks go back to 1959 and present a long list of grievances,
                                including use by the Greeks of US arms in Cyprus, which they point
                                out did not result in a US embargo of Greece. They are convinced,
                                furthermore, that they made a major contribution by getting the

                                <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> stated that he had
                                found a fear in Greece of possible expansionist intentions on the
                                part of Turkey, particularly with reference to the Aegean. This was
                                evidenced, in Greek eyes, by the occupation of Cyprus, the dispute
                                over air space, the continental shelf <pb n="39" facs="0072"
                                    xml:id="pg_39"/>and territorial waters, and the <hi

                                    >The <hi rend="italic">Sismik</hi> was a Turkish oil exploration
                                    vessel operating in the Aegean in 1976. Greece considered the
                                    presence of the <hi rend="italic">Sismik</hi> a provocation and
                                    threatened to deploy its navy to intercept the ship. News
                                    reports quoted Turkish Prime Minister Demirel as responding,
                                    “Interception of the <hi rend="italic">Sismik</hi> will be an

                                United States took no position on the Aegean issues and had no
                                desire to interfere between the two nations, but that the United
                                States was always concerned when two of its allies had disputes
                                between them.</p>

                                <hi rend="italic">Turkish Response on the Aegean.</hi> In response,
                                the Turks argued that they had good historical, equitable and legal
                                arguments with respect to the complex Aegean issues and noted that
                                Greece was turned down by both the Security Council and the World
                                Court. To them, Greece appears now to be raising procedural issues
                                to impede and delay substantive talks. The Turks further noted that
                                Greece has militarized islands off their coast in clear
                                contravention of provisions of the treaties by which Greece acquired
                                the islands, including the Treaty of Paris to which the United
                                States is a signatory. They asked why the United States does not
                                embargo arms to Greece in response to this treaty violation. The
                                Turks categorically reject the idea that they are an expansionist
                                power. They disclaim any hostile intentions against Greece and any
                                desire to take any of the Greek Aegean islands. This view was
                                especially eloquently presented by Opposition Leader <persName
                                    corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> who insisted that he and the
                                present Turkish Government stood together in this matter. They view
                                the Aegean problems as similar to those of other countries over
                                difficult maritime resource issues, and believe they can be resolved
                                by the two countries themselves through substantive negotiations.
                                They believe that Greece takes an unreasonable position in viewing
                                the Aegean as an exclusive Greek sea.</p>

                                <hi rend="italic">The Positive Response.</hi> During the course of
                                his presentation to the Turkish officials, <persName
                                    corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> stated the need for
                                movement on Cyprus in the strongest possible way. He told the Turks
                                that he hoped they would actively consider their discussions and
                                that he did not expect an immediate response. The message clearly
                                registered upon the Turkish leaders. At the final meeting with the
                                Foreign Minister and his top aides, <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1"
                                    >Clifford</persName> did receive a response. The Foreign
                                Minister, in a carefully worded statement, first repeated the basic
                                Turkish position, but then went on to say that Turkey wished to be
                                cooperative in this matter, and that the Turkish Cypriots would
                                present a concrete proposal at the March 31 intercommunal meeting in
                                Vienna, which we agreed to hold in the closest confidence. The
                                Foreign Minister proposed further that it would be helpful if the
                                Greek side would present a concrete territorial proposal, and
                                implied that the United States might be helpful in Athens and
                                Nicosia in obtaining such a step by the Greek Cypriot
                                negotiator.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> responded to the
                                Turks, after a caucus with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MWB_1"
                                    >Macomber</persName> and the members of his mission, as
                                follows:</p>
                            <p>(a) We were gratified by the serious thought they had given these
                                matters and the promptness and constructive nature of their
                                response;</p>
                            <p>(b) Their commitment to make such a concrete proposal in the Vienna
                                meeting could help lead to progress;</p>
                            <p>(c) We assumed this proposal would be reasonable, for obviously a
                                polemical proposal would be counter-productive;</p>
                            <p>(d) We agreed that it would be useful if serious territorial
                                proposals could also be on the table;</p>
                            <p>(e) We should obviously not disclose their proposed initiative, but
                                would discuss the possibilities of a territorial proposal in
                                Nicosia, London and Washington, and would keep the Government of
                                Turkey informed, and they should do the same with us.</p>
                            <p>
                                <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> did not, however,
                                give them much reason for optimism in expecting Archbishop <persName
                                    corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName> to table such a proposal.
                                He reiterated that this would be one of the matters we would discuss
                                in London and in Washington and would remain in touch with both
                                Ankara and Athens. <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName>
                                suggested the possibility of one or more third parties presenting a
                                territorial proposal through <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1"
                                    >Waldheim</persName> if for political reasons <persName
                                    corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName> would not.</p>
                            <p>
                                <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> also made the point
                                that the negotiators in Vienna should work on a sustained and
                                serious basis rather than have a mere pro forma meeting. The Turks
                                said they agreed with this and would do their best to assure Turkish
                                Cypriot cooperation.</p>
                            <p>
                                <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> promised the
                                Turkish leaders that their proposed initiative would not be
                                disclosed by him. Because the initiative might be imperiled if it
                                were publicly associated with his visit to Ankara, <persName
                                    corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> has requested that the
                                greatest confidentiality be accorded this information until such
                                time as it is made public by the parties themselves.</p>
                            <p>
                                <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> is not certain this
                                commitment by the Turkish Government will lead to real progress, but
                                it does constitute a concrete commitment. He was pleased with the
                                attitude of the Turkish leaders.</p>

                                    >Clerides</persName>, the Greek Cypriot negotiators in the

                                    >Denktash</persName>, the Turkish Cypriot negotiator and most of

                                of bizonality and to present a bizonal map with a 20 per cent
                                Turkish zone at Vienna to serve as the basis for negotiation of the

                                Cypriots was that he brought a message of friendship and concern
                                from our new President. He alluded to the Administration’s deep
                                humanitarian concern and its desire to assist in a just resolution
                                of the Cyprus problem. <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1"
                                    >Clifford</persName> indicated to President <persName
                                    corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName> and the Foreign Minister
                                that this was the best possible time to reach a settlement because
                                United States and world opinion was presently sympathetic to the
                                problem of Cyprus. However, he stated quite frankly that this
                                sympathetic attitude would change if the Cypriots did not make
                                progress in their discussions. He noted that the <gloss
                                    target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Turkish rift over Cyprus had
                                impaired our defense relationships and that a time would come when
                                we would have to remedy that situation. <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1"
                                    >Clifford</persName> implied that if the negotiations were
                                prolonged, especially by unrealistic Greek Cypriot demands, our
                                sympathy might dissipate.</p>

                                    corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName>’s message. We believe he
                                has decided to make a real attempt to reach a solution this year.
                                His agreement to table a bizonal map, referred to above, is an
                                important step. The Turks in Ankara had suggested that he try to get
                                Archbishop <persName corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName> to table
                                such a proposal. <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName>
                                had expressed pessimism about getting him to do so. The Greek

                                    >Clifford</persName>’s suggestion that the forthcoming Vienna

                                and serious. They indicated their interest in finding a procedural
                                approach that would be mutually satisfactory and would permit
                                substantive discussion.</p>

                                Turkish Cypriots were unhappy about <gloss target="#t_US_1"

                                    >Denktash</persName> explained at great length the history of
                                Turkish grievances at the hands of the Greek majority between 1960
                                and 1974. He expressed his belief that a solution could be reached
                                if the United States and the European nations left the Turkish
                                Cypriots (and the mainland Turks) alone to deal with the Greek
                                Cypriots. Western intervention, he argued, is always manipulated by
                                    <persName corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName>. However,
                                    <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> did clearly
                                state that his negotiators would present a written memorandum about
                                the allocation of authority between the central government and the
                                two bizonal states at the March 31 Vienna meetings, and that they
                                would negotiate in good faith. <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1"

                                primarily a result of his aggravation over being pressed from

                                Clifford</persName> for the outstanding job he had done on a
                            difficult task. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1"
                                >Clifford</persName> then summarized the fourteen-day mission. He
                            noted that it had been an extraordinarily interesting experience.
                            Lessons were learned on this mission that his instincts lead him to
                            conclude will be useful in the future. He thanked the Secretary for the
                            innovative, experienced and smooth team which he had been provided. He
                            then handed Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> a
                            copy of the report which he was submitting to the President.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d9fn2">See <ref target="#d8">Document 8</ref>. The report
                                includes records of <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>’s
                                discussions during his mission.</note> He thought the Secretary
                            would be pleased to learn that there was general jubilation in the area
                            over the election of President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                >Carter</persName> and particularly concerning Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>’s appointment as Secretary of
                            State.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName>’s principal conclusion
                            is that the Greek and Turkish Cypriots will never reach agreement if
                            left to themselves. There is too great a past history of recriminations
                            and mutual savagery. To negotiate within a framework of hundreds of
                            years of bitterness and suspicion is, of course, exceedingly
                            difficult.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> reported his team’s
                            conclusion that progress on Cyprus necessitated effective leverage on
                                <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName>, and the Turkish
                            Cypriots. This leverage had to come from Turkey. Therefore, the Ankara
                            stop was perhaps the most critical one of the entire mission. The first
                            full day in Ankara was spent building personal relationships. Once these
                            were built the firm and clear message was delivered that a US-Turkish
                                <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> could not be enacted without
                            constructive and active help by the <pb n="44" facs="0077"
                                xml:id="pg_44"/>Turkish Government in regard to Cyprus. The Turks
                            were informed that this was not due to the “Greek lobby” but rather
                            reflected a general Congressional attitude shared by its senior
                            leadership. The Turks were told that they were of course sovereign and
                            independent and could do as they liked, but if they wanted a <gloss
                                target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> they would have to act as the
                            Administration’s active partner in the Eastern Mediterranean while
                            trusting the Government to be Turkey’s partner in Washington. This idea
                            appeared to have some appeal.</p>
                        <p>It should not be overlooked, <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1"
                                >Clifford</persName> added, that the Turks are still embittered by
                            what they perceive as an unfair and humiliating embargo. They also
                            suffer from a national inferiority complex and feel isolated and
                            unappreciated. At the end of the <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1"
                                >Clifford</persName> visit, however, they were reasonably assured
                            that the <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> team was
                            Turkey’s sincere friend, but also understood that Turkish efforts on
                            Cyprus would be required if the US-Turkish relationship was to be
                            restored and improved.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> reported that at the
                            last hour of the last meeting on the last day in Ankara the Turkish
                            Foreign Minister said his Government had given intensive thought to
                                <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName>’s presentation and
                            would instruct the Turkish Cypriots to make a concrete constitutional
                            proposal in the next round of intercommunal talks. The Foreign Minister
                            stressed that he desired a reciprocal commitment from <persName
                                corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName> to put forward an equally
                            concrete territorial proposal. The Turks made clear their potential
                            embarrassment if they were the only side to make a concrete offer. They
                            were given no commitment by <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1"
                                >Clifford</persName> though he undertook to persuade <persName
                                corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName> of the merit of presenting a
                            territorial proposal. The Turks agreed that ultimately their offer was
                            not conditioned upon a proposal from the Greek Cypriots. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> then called to the
                            Secretary’s attention some interesting intelligence reports concerning
                            this matter.<note n="3" xml:id="d9fn3">Not further identified. See <ref

                        </p>
                        <p>In Nicosia, <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> had two long
                            visits with Archbishop <persName corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName>.
                            The first opened with a long discussion of each other’s personal
                            background and formal matters. The discussion then turned to the Cyprus
                            problem and <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> described
                            the Turkish proposal indicating that the time had come for an equal
                            contribution from the Greek Cypriots. <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1"
                                >Clifford</persName> asked <persName corresp="#p_M3_1"
                                >Makarios</persName> to think about the fact that the deep interest
                            displayed by the Government and Congress of the United States for a
                            Cyprus solution could well be a diminishing asset. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> suggested that <persName
                                corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName> move quickly. The United
                            States over the last thirty years had invested a great deal in <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> and in <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss>’s southern flank—Greece and Turkey. This investment
                            was important and when ultimately weighed against American interests in
                            Cyprus would eventu<pb n="45" facs="0078" xml:id="pg_45"/>ally be
                            overriding. 1977 represented the best year for a favorable solution
                            since it is possible that by 1978 the United States could not risk
                            further endangering <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> then described the
                            Archbishop’s three options: (1) negotiate now while friends were
                            interested; (2) negotiate later alone; and (3) the worst alternative,
                            failure to negotiate and being left with a divided island secured by
                            Turkish troops. <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName>
                            described his farewell with <persName corresp="#p_M3_1"
                                >Makarios</persName> after this meeting as having been formally warm
                            and in fact cool to the point where he doubted the Archbishop would
                            desire to hold a second meeting.</p>
                        <p>The same evening <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName>
                            delivered a similar message to the Greek Ambassador to Cyprus who
                            displayed a good deal of concern.<note n="4" xml:id="d9fn4">No record of

                            <persName corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName> renewed the tentatively
                            set farewell meeting planned for the next day. The meeting lasted for
                            over an hour and <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> said
                            the message from the previous meeting had the desired impact. <persName
                                corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName> committed himself to putting a
                            map on the table in Vienna. This map is to accept the principle of
                            bi-zonality and form the basis for serious territorial negotiations.</p>
                        <p>The Archbishop evidenced a concern that the Turkish constitutional
                            proposal would be a charade. <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1"
                                >Clifford</persName> assured him that the Turkish Foreign Minister
                            clearly understood the need for a serious Turkish Cypriot constitutional
                            proposal which would provide a reasonable basis for negotiations.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> described the
                            Archbishop’s complaint about dividing Cyprus into two local governments.
                                <persName corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName> expressed his
                            concern about such federal arrangements. <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1"
                                >Clifford</persName> responded that the United States had no problem
                            whatsoever with such a solution since we had made a federal government
                            work for over two hundred years.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> believes that the
                            trouble with the intercommunal negotiations to date is that there had
                            been interminable talk but nothing concrete on the table. He noted that
                            the mission had been very discreet in expressions of optimism until it
                            had received the two firm commitments. Then the mission consciously
                            decided to speak out in a more optimistic tone and to indicate that a
                            solution in 1977 was now possible.<note n="5" xml:id="d9fn5">In a news

                                >Clifford</persName> aside and for twenty minutes discussed the two
                            British Sovereign Base Areas. <persName corresp="#p_OD_1"
                                >Owen</persName> indicated he would raise this issue with the
                            President and the Secretary during his March visit to Washington.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> offered his opinion
                            that these bases, which are actually British sovereign soil, are
                            important and should be maintained. He noted that their 99 square miles
                            and 2,000 British military cost the British £36 million a year.
                                <persName corresp="#p_OD_1">Owen</persName> was fishing for some
                            encouragement that the United States could help them meet this expense.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> said he gave him
                            none beyond acknowledging that the bases are important. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> then said the British would
                            seek a clear indication of the new Administration’s attitude toward the
                            bases. <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> understands that
                            there was an agreement the UK would give the United States five years’
                            advance notice before abandoning either of the <gloss target="#t_SBA_1"
                                >SBA</gloss>’s. (Notetaker comment: this came from General <persName

                                >NSA</gloss> in a meeting with <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1"
                                >Clifford</persName> on February 26, 1977.) <persName
                                corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> thought <persName
                                corresp="#p_OD_1">Owen</persName> might ask for money but that he
                            would not at this point raise British abandonment of the bases.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> then explained the
                            approach he and his team had taken toward our bases in Turkey. There had
                            been a conscious decision to not mention them at all. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> said he repeatedly listed a
                            number of issues of concern between the United States and Turkey, never
                            including the bases. This so worried the Turks that Demirel finally
                            asked <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> about “our very
                            valuable bases.” <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName>
                            replied that in our relationship there are many other important issues
                            and that for the time being we were making other arrangements. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> assured Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> and the others of his
                            realization that the bases are valuable and that we ultimately want them
                            open, but that for now the relationship between Turkey and the United
                            States is best served if the Turks concentrated on other things, i.e.,
                            Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> then turned to the
                            Aegean. He had been startled at the vehemence of <persName
                                corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName>’ assertions that Turkish
                            policy had now entered a new expansionist phase and that grave danger
                            lies ahead. This emotion coming from the impressive and moderate
                                <persName corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName> had been
                            noteworthy. <persName corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName> took over
                            an hour to describe the several Aegean disputes. In summary there are
                            five: (1) delimitation of the continental shelf (<persName
                                corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> explained how absurd the
                            Turks find the Greek theory which, based upon their many Aegean islands,
                            effectively <pb n="47" facs="0080" xml:id="pg_47"/>denies to Turkey any
                            continental shelf); (2) air space; (3) territorial waters; (4) Greek
                            fortification of the Dodecanese and other islands (which Greece claims
                            is purely defensive and the Turks find a clear treaty violation); and
                            (5) the Turkish amphibian force on the Aegean (which was the most
                            worrisome for <persName corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName>).</p>
                        <p>After giving the Greek explanation for each of these issues, <persName
                                corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName> explained to <persName
                                corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> that he and the Greek people
                            had already suffered two humiliations at the hands of the Turks. These
                            were the second invasion of Cyprus and last summer’s sailings of the
                            SISMIK into disputed Aegean waters.<note n="7" xml:id="d9fn7">See <ref
                                    target="#d8fn10">footnote 10, Document 8</ref>.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName> claimed he had been
                            exceedingly moderate in both cases but could not guarantee continued
                            moderation if provoked again. He also claimed that he had tried to
                            negotiate these issues but had not been met with serious Turkish
                            responses.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> said he took great
                            pains to explain this Greek attitude to the Turks. During the second day
                            in Ankara, the Turks spent two and a half hours stoutly defending
                            themselves against the Greek charges. On some of the issues their case
                            has merit and on others it does not. In any event, Turkey has now
                            learned, from us, of the severity of present Greek views and of American
                            concern that any conflict between the two would be a grave event indeed.
                            Turkey now knows the United States would react negatively toward any
                            provocations and that the arms flow to both sides would be cut off in
                            the event of hostilities. <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1"
                                >Clifford</persName> concluded that individually the Aegean issues
                            seem amenable to technical solution. He recommended the United States
                            Government conduct a serious study of these issues and how they might be
                            resolved. Finally, he judged this three-sided exchange of views valuable
                            in that Greece and Turkey are aware that the United States expects them
                            to act in a cautious and responsible manner.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> asked <persName
                                corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> if <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> was on board regarding the
                            substantive constitutional proposal. <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1"
                                >Clifford</persName> answered that in each country he had met with
                            opposition leaders, with the knowledge of the government. He had held a
                            long visit with <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> who seemed
                            very intelligent and argued strongly for a Cyprus solution. On the other
                            hand, Prime Minister Demirel expressed to <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1"
                                >Clifford</persName> his fear that <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                >Ecevit</persName> is really waiting in the wings to accuse Demirel
                            of caving in to United States pressures on Cyprus. Demirel offered up
                            his weak governing coalition and the imminence of elections as excuses
                            for an inability to act. <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1"
                                >Clifford</persName> told him that the time had come for action and
                            that his internal problems could not be accepted as impediments to a
                            Cyprus solution.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_HPC_1">Habib</persName> then asked if Demirel
                            wasn’t really more afraid of his coalition partner <persName
                                corresp="#p_EN_1">Erbakan</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1"
                                >Clifford</persName> responded that coalition problems must <pb
                                n="48" facs="0081" xml:id="pg_48"/>have been seriously considered
                            before the Turkish Government decided to instruct <persName
                                corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> on the constitutional
                            proposal. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> then added
                            that he did not think <persName corresp="#p_EN_1">Erbakan</persName>
                            would torpedo the constitutional proposal, but that a final solution
                            would probably have to come after the Turkish election.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> asked if
                                <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> thought <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> would sabotage it. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> said <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> eloquently asserted the time had
                            come for a solution. He was probably not aware of the specific proposal
                            but he probably will not oppose it. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1"
                                >Nimetz</persName> reminded the group that <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> on the other hand is a hardliner
                            on the Aegean. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>
                            told of <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>’s comment to him
                            four months ago that he would settle for a percentage of the oil in the
                            Aegean, but felt the sovereignty problems would be much more difficult
                            to resolve.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> also reminded the group
                            that since Athens had been the mission’s first stop, it had not been
                            possible to report back to them on Turkish thinking. Moreover, the
                            Greeks were not flexible at all on the Aegean issues. Therefore, it was
                            clear that some time soon we would need to get back to them.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> asked if
                                <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> was prepared to
                            follow Ankara’s direction regarding Cyprus or would he find a way to
                            drag his feet. <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> thought
                                <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> had no alternatives.
                            His talk with <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> had been
                            very difficult and <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> was
                            almost personally offensive, but this was understandable. He was upset
                            at recent instructions he had received from Ankara to push the concrete
                            proposal. At the end of the meeting <persName corresp="#p_DR_1"
                                >Denktash</persName> grudgingly indicated he would do as he was
                            instructed and that the time had come for all Cypriots to agree on a
                            solution. He reiterated, however, his resentment of United States
                            involvement and his belief that whenever an American visits Cyprus, it
                            always strengthens <persName corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName>.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> said this long,
                            rather negative talk helped <persName corresp="#p_DR_1"
                                >Denktash</persName> work off some steam so that in a major press
                            conference afterward he seemed mollified, and made helpful
                            statements.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> said he felt
                                <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> would not be totally
                            intransigent. <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> agreed
                                <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> had to be responsive
                            since economic and military realities made him a servant of Ankara.
                            Moreover, the Turkish area of Cyprus had appeared to <persName
                                corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> strikingly poorer than the
                            Greek section. The Turkish area was feeling economic pressure and the
                            Turkish Cypriots and Turkey may have decided it was time to settle.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> then asked if the
                            Archbishop had really committed himself to a bi-zonal solution.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> said he thought so
                            and described the map <persName corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName>
                            had shown him which had included a Turkish zone which was very small but
                            was clearly bi-zonal. <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName>
                            concluded that he had asked the Archbishop if he now accepted
                            bi-zonality and the answer was yes. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1"
                                >Nimetz</persName> stated that he and Mr. <pb n="49" facs="0082"
                                xml:id="pg_49"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LNC_1">Ledsky</persName> had also pressed the
                            Cypriot Foreign Minister at a separate meeting who clearly understood
                            and accepted the necessity for proposing a bi-zonal system with a
                            dividing line providing the Turks with at least twenty percent of the
                                Republic.<note n="8" xml:id="d9fn8">No record of this meeting was
                                found.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_HPC_1">Habib</persName> then asked if the Greek
                            Cypriots would also submit a paper on the new constitution. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> said no. Both sides will be
                            content if each puts forward one proposal and then responds to the
                            proposal of the other. <persName corresp="#p_LNC_1">Ledsky</persName>
                            advised that this was necessary since <persName corresp="#p_EN_1"
                                >Erbakan</persName> would not permit a Turkish territorial proposal.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> reported that in both
                            Ankara and Nicosia the need for sustained and non-interrupted
                            negotiations had been stressed.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary and <persName corresp="#p_HPC_1">Habib</persName> then
                            asked what the role for the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> would be.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> described his
                            meeting with <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> in which
                            he had reassured the latter that the United States and the <persName
                                corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> mission would support and
                            complement <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> efforts. <persName
                                corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> was receptive to the offer of
                            assistance and found especially attractive the idea that at appropriate
                            times suggestions for breaking any stalemates would be passed to him.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> concluded that in
                            spite of past failures <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName>
                            and the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> do have a role to play and
                            that at some time someone, perhaps <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1"
                                >Waldheim</persName>, will have to describe a reasonable settlement
                            to the parties and then make them accept it. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HPC_1">Habib</persName> wondered whether that party
                            would not, in fact, have to be the United States. The Secretary replied
                            that while the United States might have to provide the final impetus for
                            a solution, such a push would best come under the umbrella of the United
                            Nations.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> then raised the problem
                            of the European Communities’ role. At one point he had felt the <gloss
                                target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> could usefully put forth a map but he
                            now strongly doubted they could take a visible, active role. The Turkish
                            Foreign Minister, in the strongest terms, had urged we not seek <gloss
                                target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> involvement. The reason he gave was
                            Soviet nervousness. Interestingly, in Nicosia the Archbishop had also
                            welcomed a US role but again cautioned against <gloss target="#t_EC_1"
                                >EC</gloss> initiatives. <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1"
                                >Clifford</persName> joined the Secretary in concluding that the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> is best positioned to play a
                            decisive role with US support and encouragement. A US role will be
                            required, however, since <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1"
                                >Waldheim</persName> has little leverage.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> then picked up
                            his copy of <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName>’s report
                            and promised to send it immediately to the President. He then turned to
                            the Congressional question pointing out that they are very interested
                            and that dealing with them will require great care. An approach must be
                            designed to treat the informational and policy elements of the
                            problem.</p>
                        <pb n="50" facs="0083" xml:id="pg_50"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> then asked where
                            we stood on the Greek <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> outlined the status of the
                            stalled talks and reported on his specific request to <persName
                                corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName> to reopen them. At the last
                            official event in Athens, Greek Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_BD_2">Bitsios</persName> told <persName
                                corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> he had been instructed by the
                            Prime Minister to select a team and resume negotiations in mid-March.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HPC_1">Habib</persName> then asked <persName
                                corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> if he felt a US team should
                            be created or if the Ambassador and <gloss target="#t_DCM_1">DCM</gloss>
                            should continue to direct the effort. It was agreed that this should be
                            dealt with later.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> then reported on
                            his conversation with Senator <persName corresp="#p_SPS_1"
                                >Sarbanes</persName> earlier in the week. The Senator told him he
                            had heard the State Department would recommend movement on both <gloss
                                target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>’s.<note n="9" xml:id="d9fn9">No record
                                of this meeting was found.</note> He added he would have trouble
                            with the total amount of assistance to Turkey over the four-year span
                            which he felt was out of proportion to their contribution toward Cyprus
                            progress. He asked the Secretary to scale down the size of Turkish aid.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> stated that the
                            Senator had not been accurately informed and did not clearly understand
                            the mission’s goals. <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName>
                            said the recommendation in his report is that the President generally
                            endorse the Turkish <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> in principle
                            but not move to finalize it. To encourage continued Turkish cooperation,
                            however, he would recommend $175 million in military assistance for
                            Turkey in <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1978. The $50 million
                            increase over 1977 would be a reward for their cooperation. The
                            difference between the <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1978 proposal
                            and a full four-year $1 billion <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>
                            would remain as a carrot to induce further cooperation. The Secretary
                            asked if the Turks understood this. <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1"
                                >Clifford</persName> explained that it had not been bluntly
                            communicated to them since it required a decision by the Secretary and
                            the President.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_HPC_1">Habib</persName> feared the Turks would
                            claim that they could do no more until they got the whole <gloss
                                target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1"
                                >Clifford</persName> said this had been the unhappy stalemate in the
                            past, but that the Turks now seemed to accept the idea of an active
                            partnership between Turkey and the United States to resolve the Cyprus
                            dispute and its relationship to defense cooperation. The Secretary
                            stated he had just read a message which indicated that the Turks
                            understood and accepted this.<note n="10" xml:id="d9fn10">Not further

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LNC_1">Ledsky</persName> gave his opinion that
                            in spite of the Greek acceptance of a resumption of negotiations they
                            will drag their feet until they are sure whether the new Administration

                                <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> should appear, but
                            that he should provide them with details only in closed session. He
                            thought it should be possible to work out something with Chairman
                                <persName corresp="#p_ZCJ_1">Zablocki</persName> and that <persName

                                corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> agreed it would be wise to
                            reserve much of his report to private sessions.</p>
                        <p>He then explained that during the mission he had stressed the President’s
                            early and personal interest in the Eastern Mediterranean to great
                            effect. To build up the momentum developed it would be very helpful to
                            have an early meeting with the President. After the meeting a carefully
                            thought out statement should be issued. Everyone agreed such a meeting
                            was imperative, not only for the signal it would send to the area, but
                            also to provide guidance for future contacts on the Hill. The Secretary
                            undertook to arrange such a meeting and once again thanked Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> for his effort.</p>

                                >See <ref target="#d8">Document 8</ref>.</note> He described it as
                            exhilarating and thought it had accomplished more than he had expected.
                            The mission brought a message of hope from a new President.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Cyprus</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> described his
                            strategy with regard to the Cyprus issue. The mission tried to see where
                            leverage existed. In Turkey the message was one of partnership: Turkey
                            wants an end to the arms embargo, and we want progress on Cyprus. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> disabused the Turks
                            of any thought that the position of Congress is only the result of the
                            “Greek lobby.” On the last day of the visit, the Foreign Minister
                            indicated that Ankara would press Turkish Cypriot leader <persName
                                corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> to submit a concrete proposal
                            on the form of government for Cyprus at the intercommunal negotiations
                            in Vienna at the end of March.</p>
                        <p>In Cyprus the message was very different. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> told <persName
                                corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName> of the Turkish initiative and
                            indicated that <persName corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName> should
                            present a territorial proposal. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1"
                                >Clifford</persName> noted the help we have rendered to Cyprus in
                            the past but suggested that we cannot continue indefinitely at serious
                            cost to our <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> relationships. In the
                            end, <persName corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName> agreed that his
                            negotiator would present a reasonable bizonal map in Vienna.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName>’s conversation with
                                <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> was the least
                            pleasant of any of his discussions. <persName corresp="#p_DR_1"
                                >Denktash</persName> resented being pressured by Ankara, but he
                            confirmed that he would present a proposal in Vienna.</p>

                            at the vehemence of Greek Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_CC_1"
                                >Caramanlis</persName>’ description of “Turkish expansionism” in the
                            Aegean. <persName corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName> said he had
                            been pushed as far as he could go, and any further Turkish action could
                            lead to war. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName>
                            believed, however, that the Aegean differences between Greece and Turkey
                            could be solved. The United States may be able to serve as a moderating,
                            intermediate influence. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1"
                                >Clifford</persName>, for instance, had been able to convey the

                        <p>We need to decide what strategy to follow with respect to our policies in
                            the Eastern Mediterranean now that the Vienna round of Cyprus
                            intercommunal talks has taken place.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Based on reports to date, it seems clear that both the Turkish and Greek
                            Cypriots have met their basic commitments to <persName
                                corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clark Clifford</persName>, i.e., the Turks tabled
                            a constitutional proposal, the Greeks put forward a territorial proposal
                            in the form of a map, and some substantive discussion of these proposals
                            took place in Vienna.<note n="2" xml:id="d11fn2">The meetings concluded
                                on April 7. See <ref target="#d38fn3">footnote 3, Document
                                38</ref>.</note> While both proposals were clearly inadequate and
                            were held to be unacceptable by the other side, they appear to have been
                            seriously worked out and put forward in good faith, and represented some
                            minimal advance from past substantive positions. The Vienna meetings
                            were used to exchange views on the proposals, although neither side
                            retreated from its respective opening positions which are far apart. The
                            parties are expected to meet again for another round in Nicosia next
                            month. However, Archbishop <persName corresp="#p_M3_1"
                                >Makarios</persName>’ illness and the pending June election in
                            Turkey will probably make important concessions impossible in the next
                            few weeks.</p>
                        <p>Continued United States support and involvement will be needed at every
                            step if any early positive results are to be achieved. The presence of a
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> observer in Vienna was welcomed
                            and appreciated by the U.N. as well as both parties. A continued <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> role is regarded as essential by all
                            concerned. The Turkish Foreign Minister observer in Vienna even went so
                            far as to suggest a future Cyprus negotiating procedure to replace the
                            intercommunal talks which would have Greece, Turkey, the UK, and <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> all at the table together with the
                            Greek Cypriots and <pb n="55" facs="0088" xml:id="pg_55"/>Turkish
                            Cypriots. The Cypriot Ambassador here asked <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1"
                                >Clark Clifford</persName> to consider more active <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> involvement.</p>
                        <p>A comment should be made about the parties’ proposals. The Turkish
                            Cypriot constitutional proposal, if implemented, would create a
                            government that resembles a confederation more than a federation. This
                            is not acceptable to the Greek Cypriots. Clearly the central government
                            must be given more authority. The Greek Cypriot territorial proposal is
                            not really bizonal (it has two zones and two enclaves, which meet at a
                            “federal” road-junction) and gives inadequate territory to the Turkish
                            zone. Clearly, the Turkish zone must be expanded. However, our summary
                            view is that the results of Vienna, while hardly a breakthrough, were
                            probably about all that could realistically have been expected at this
                            stage. Due largely to <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clark
                                Clifford</persName>’s discussions and energetic <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> follow-up, a process has at least been
                            started.</p>
                        <p>In considering our future strategy, these additional factors should also
                            be borne in mind:</p>
                        <p>A. Regardless of what flows from their proposal in Vienna, the Turks will
                            expect something positive from the Administration since they lived up to
                            their commitment to put a constitutional proposal on the table, and to
                            negotiate in good faith. Continued silence by the Administration after
                            Vienna will be seen in Ankara as proof that Washington is unreliable or
                            has chosen pro-Greek policies. Such an approach may lead to a negative
                            Turkish reaction to future Cyprus talks. Insisting upon a total solution
                            to Cyprus before aid levels are established runs grave risks in the
                            highly charged US-Turkish relationship, affecting important <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> interests.</p>
                        <p>B. Given the approaching June Turkish elections, a breakthrough toward a
                            Cyprus settlement cannot be expected in May or June, although a process
                            of constructive discussion should be sustainable.</p>
                        <p>C. To comply with a tight legislative schedule, the Congress must receive
                            Administration recommendations on the <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss>
                            1978 military assistance package by the time it returns from Easter
                            recess on April 18.</p>
                        <p>D. The Greek and Cypriot Governments can be expected to be disappointed
                            with any Administration recommendations for increased levels of military
                            sales credits to Turkey for <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1978.</p>
                        <p>E. US-Greek negotiations on the Greek <gloss target="#t_DCA_1"
                                >DCA</gloss> are due to resume April 13. <persName corresp="#p_KK_1"
                                >Karamanlis</persName> clearly wants to move Greece back to closer
                            integration into <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> and wants to
                            stabilize the US-Greek bilateral security relationship. By early May it
                            should be possible to determine whether the Greeks will move quickly to
                            complete these negotiations with the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> or whether they will drag their feet until they come
                            to realize that the Administration will support Congressional approval
                            at some point of the Turkish-US Defense Cooperation Agreement.</p>
                        <pb n="56" facs="0089" xml:id="pg_56"/>
                        <p>F. Difficulties in the Aegean traditionally increase seasonally in the
                            spring and summer; this is likely to happen shortly, thus taking the
                            spotlight off Cyprus as far as the Greeks and Turks are concerned. We do
                            not want to link these two problem areas. Studies are underway regarding
                            how the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> might help defuse or
                            resolve the complex of Aegean disputes. We will be back to you on this
                            later.</p>
                        <p>Bearing these factors in mind, we would suggest the following
                            scenario:</p>

                            justifies it, and has <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clark
                                Clifford</persName>’s concurrence, because of a feeling that the
                            Turkish Cypriots were less forthcoming at the recent Vienna talks than
                            they might have been. But I am not sure that holding back $15 million
                            may not simply annoy the Turkish military leaders and be felt by Demirel
                            as a petty wrist-slap as he goes into elections while it may have no
                            effect at all on the Turkish Cypriots in the next phase of the Cyprus
                            negotiations. If we are going to ask Congress to give Greece $175
                            million, we are best off being formally even-handed and asking for the
                            same amount for Turkey. (In actuality, considering Turkey’s far greater
                            population and much larger armed forces, the same amounts are not really
                            even-handed at all.)</p>

                            any aid to Turkey, they feel they have good chances of persuading the

                            not in the spirit of the President’s campaign promises; that they were
                            justified by neither human rights concerns nor by the outcome of the
                            recent Vienna discussions; that the increase in military transfers to
                            Turkey, including the exception for F–4s, was not just from $125 million
                            to $175 million but potentially to as much as a half billion dollars;
                            and that our policy amounted to a return to that of <persName

                        <p>In response, the President and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1"
                                >Vance</persName> both regretted the breakdown in communications.
                            The President indicated that the Administration had done all it could to
                            promote a Cyprus settlement—including sending <persName
                                corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clark Clifford</persName> to the region—and the
                            $175 would demonstrate our evenhandedness. He said he wanted to hear
                            what the Congressional discussants found objectionable.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> made similar
                            comments. He offered that if the Committee deleted the exemption for
                            F–4s, the Administration would not fight it. The President stressed
                            Turkish paranoia about any linkage between the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1"
                                >DCA</gloss> and Cyprus. That is overriding, and he thought we had
                            gone as far as we could, public, in making a link. Privately, the Turks
                            are under no illusions: they know there is a link.</p>
                        <p>There was implicit agreement on two points:</p>

                            informed of that, but the President stressed that no public mention be

                            suggesting a linkage (farther, in fact, than the President expected).
                            The members of Congress can run with those statements. They will
                            endeavor not to bring <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> back
                            to testify again.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Comment</p>
                        <p>The concession on the F–4 exemption will be taken hard by the Turks, but
                            the fall-out should be manageable provided we can make it appear that we
                            fought the good fight and lost. That, however, will not be easy. It will
                            take a careful orchestration. And we may be in the difficult position of
                            dissuading those who are prepared to support our formal position.
                                (<persName corresp="#p_HLH_1">Hamilton</persName>, for instance,
                            told us that he thought the package as proposed could pass both the
                            Committee and the full House.) Similarly with the <gloss
                                target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>, the magnificent ambiguity will be
                            hard to sustain. If Turkish officials or newsmen get a whiff of the
                            arrangement, they will pester with questions that will make it hard to
                            avoid either: (a) directly contradicting what <persName
                                corresp="#p_BJ_1">Brademas</persName>
                            <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> are saying; or (b) suggesting publicly that
                            there is a link. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> and I
                            have agreed that our best hope is letting the proposal proceed as
                            quietly as possible through the committees.</p>

                            11th, with Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1"
                                >Caglayangil</persName> of Turkey. He felt the breakfast went well
                            and that there was a frank exchange of views and there seemed to be a
                            desire on <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName>’s part to
                            get his positions clearly before the four men. At the conclusion of this
                            report, <persName corresp="#p_BJ_1">Brademas</persName> asked that I
                            bring the men up to date on the status of the present negotiations
                            involving Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>I stated I felt the general climate in the Eastern Mediterranean had
                            improved considerably since our trip some eight or nine months ago. The
                            Greeks seem to be acting moderately and we had definite word from the
                            Turks that they would refrain from provocative acts in the Aegean. I
                            dealt at some length on recent talks with <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1"
                                >Caglayangil</persName> in New York and the results of the <persName

                        </p>
                        <p>I informed the group that it was clearly my opinion that the Turkish
                            government had reached a policy decision to settle the Cyprus problem. I
                            thought this was due to a substantial degree because of the precarious
                            Turkish financial position. I stated that in the course of the recent
                            meetings which had been held with <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1"
                                >Caglayangil</persName>, subjects such as withdrawal of Turkish
                            troops from Cyprus, structure of the new government, territorial
                            settlement in Cyprus and similar problems, had been discussed in depth.
                            I expressed the opinion that progress was being made.</p>
                        <p>Each of the four men spoke and took the position that oral
                            representations from the Turks would mean nothing to them. It would be
                            necessary that definite action be taken. At one time or another, the
                            following suggestions for concrete action were made by them: <hi
                                rend="italic">(1)</hi> The <pb n="63" facs="0096" xml:id="pg_63"
                            />Greeks should be permitted to return to Famagusta and the operations
                            there should be reactivated; <hi rend="italic">(2)</hi> The airport,
                            which has been closed since 1974, should be reopened. Not only would it
                            be a great convenience to travelers but it would indicate a willingness
                            on the part of the Turks to cooperate; and <hi rend="italic">(3)</hi>
                            The main highway, which has been closed since 1974, should be
                            reopened.</p>
                        <p>These acts would constitute symbolic gestures demonstrating the good
                            faith of the Turks and their desire to solve the complexities of
                            Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>One rather interesting facet of the conversation was that the four men
                            indicated they were not impressed by the Turkish suggestion that the
                            withdrawal of Turkish troops from Cyprus would begin. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName> had indicated that the
                            presence of the Turkish troops there constituted a financial drain, so
                                <persName corresp="#p_SPS_1">Sarbanes</persName>’ attitude was that
                            the Turks would be doing this mainly for their own benefit and not as a
                            step toward peace. I disagreed with this and we had a friendly
                            discussion over the subject. I took the position that it would be
                            unrealistic to expect a settlement of all the issues in Cyprus before
                            the Congress would move on the matter. I said I thought there should be
                            simultaneous movement on the part of the Turks and Congress and that, as
                            progress was made, each side would be in a better position to make
                            concessions. <persName corresp="#p_SPS_1">Sarbanes</persName> wanted to
                            know immediately what kind of concessions I had in mind. I replied that
                            I was not in a position to go into detail in this regard but that a
                            number of concessions had already been made by Congress and these could
                            be carried forward.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SPS_1">Sarbanes</persName>, instead of attacking
                            the Turkish Defense Cooperation Agreement in its entirety, said he felt
                            that the principal fault of this program was that it extended for four
                            years. He believes this is a mistake. We do not have other similar
                            agreements for such a long period of time with other allies. When I
                            reminded him that the Greek <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> was for
                            four years, he said he was sure the Greeks would be willing to reduce
                            the term if the Turkish <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> were
                            similarly reduced.<note n="3" xml:id="d14fn3">The <gloss

                        </p>
                        <p>The suggestion was made that it might be advisable for the Administration
                            to abandon the idea of a Turkish <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>. I
                            felt called upon at this point to reiterate my personal support for the
                            Turkish <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> and to give my reasons why
                            I thought it should be passed ultimately. I argued that it was important
                            that we strengthen both Greece and Turkey’s military competence within
                            the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> framework. I concluded my
                            remarks on the note that I was very comfortable in the conviction that
                            strengthening these two <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> allies
                            would not in any way change the balance of military power between
                            them.</p>

                        <p>The climate of the meeting was friendly and more conciliatory than I had
                            anticipated. From time to time in the discussion, each man emphasized
                            the fact that the position they were taking was not only a moderate one,
                            but it was their intention to cooperate.</p>

                        <p>After reading the memorandum over, I was conscious of the fact that I had
                            not ascertained the manner in which the breakfast was set up between the
                            four Members of Congress and Foreign Minister <persName

                            and possibly having a talk.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BJ_1">Brademas</persName> replied that he had a

                                <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName> so he suggested
                            that he would get the other three men together for breakfast and they
                            could meet with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName>

                            <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clark Clifford</persName> asked that you
                            and the President be informed of what he told me during an hour’s review
                            on 14 October 1977 of his recent involvement in the Greece-Turkey-Cyprus
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>He feels the climate for recent talks was greatly improved because there
                            had been no flare-up of Greek-Turkish tension in the Aegean during the
                            summer. Last spring the Greeks were all talking of <hi rend="italic"
                                >war</hi> with the Turks. <persName corresp="#p_BD_2"
                                >Bitsios</persName> never used this word during his talks last week
                            with <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> and <persName

                                >Clifford</persName>’s net impression from talks with <persName
                                corresp="#p_BD_2">Bitsios</persName> is that the Greeks are no
                            longer gripped by fear of Turkey and therefore more amenable to real
                            bargaining after their elections, but that they have little enthusiasm
                            for a settlement and would just as well stall indefinitely. <persName

                                corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> asked to make an opening
                            statement:</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">
                                <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>:</hi> I believe there
                            is a real chance that the Turks are prepared to try to deal with the

                            not deal with the problem, it will fester and get much worse. It is
                            dangerous for <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> to have a weak
                            Turkey. I do not think we should look at the situation in terms of
                            whether Greek opposition is going to change over the next year or so. If
                            we do not deal with the problem now, it is going to erupt. Even though
                            there is a great deal of political risk involved—we may have a real
                            fight—the importance of what can be achieved is worth that risk.</p>

                            learned a lot in nine months. The Turks have continued to be difficult
                            as is their nature. They are deeply aggrieved by the actions our
                            government—as if it were a unit—has taken, as they put it. One factor
                            that has been demonstrated to me is the need we have to continue to back
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> all the way. Greece and
                            Turkey constitute the southern anchor of <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss>. Turkey has found no other course of action that would
                            suit her purposes better than remaining in <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss>. Because Turkey is very important to <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>, it is very important to us. Turkey
                            has not cooperated well with us up to now.</p>
                        <p>We still have an interest in Cyprus—but as a matter of fact, Cyprus is
                            just one smaller piece on the chessboard—it is Turkey and Greece and our
                            efforts to prevent trouble between them that matter. We do not want to
                            give the Soviets a chance to be real troublemakers in the Eastern
                            Mediterranean. The Turks want the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1"
                            >DCA</gloss>—they say, “You sign it and we will get on.” It is of
                            enormous significance to them. The military level of Turkey has been
                            slipping downward rather fast. It will not take a lot of money to get
                            them back in good shape. The <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> will
                            do it.</p>
                        <p>Cy and I had an enormously successful meeting in New York during the

                            For the first time we had a breakthrough: <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1"
                                >Caglayangil</persName> said: “It is my government’s intention to
                            settle the Cyprus matter.” Then he gave the reasons, including the fact
                            that they have very serious problems in their economy. As we talked on,
                            he gave us the impression that the Turkish Government is putting Cyprus
                            high on its agenda; they are facing reality almost for the first time.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName> said, “We intend
                            to settle the question of Cyprus.” I believe him and know that Cy
                            believed him at the time. But <pb n="68" facs="0101" xml:id="pg_68"/>the
                            Turks cannot go ahead and do all that our Greek friends would like them
                            to do on Cyprus. The answer is that we and they must move
                            contemporaneously. We want to face up to the decisions—it is the
                            unanimous opinion of all of us that the President should decide that he
                            is ready to proceed to persuade the Congress to pass the Turkish <gloss
                                target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>. There are things the Turks can
                            do—make some statements about settlement on Cyprus, e.g. They can start
                            withdrawing troops. They can start talking about how the new government
                            in Cyprus is to be constructed—<persName corresp="#p_CIS_1"
                                >Caglayangil</persName> said we should not worry about that, “We
                            will work out a reasonable arrangement on the government.” Then there is
                            the question of the dividing lines. The Turks can start talking about
                            that. <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName> went back and
                            talked to Demirel—the State Department now has word that Demirel’s
                            government approves this approach and is prepared to move. So we must
                            work together—they start to move toward a settlement and we plan the

                                >DCA</gloss> passed. We can do it. We can get the help of our
                            military. <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">George Brown</persName> said that
                            they would go all-out to help us organize support in Congress. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HAM_1">Al Haig</persName> will come back if we want him
                            to. If people on the fence in Congress hear a strong military
                            presentation, it will be difficult for the Greek Lobby to convince
                            fence-sitters that there are other considerations that are more
                            important.</p>
                        <p>We have initialled a Greek <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>. We would
                            like the Greeks to be prepared to move with us on their <gloss
                                target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>—we should move on both <gloss
                                target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>’s in Congress together. I agree with
                            Cy that there is a certain risk to the President and the government if
                            we go ahead. But it is my conviction that there is a greater risk if we
                            do not go ahead. I don’t know how long we could continue to hold the
                            Turks in line otherwise. They have come in with a reasonable attitude. A
                            rebuff from us would be quite serious. It is actually in the basic
                            selfish interest of both the Greeks and the Turks for us to move ahead.
                            So—if we are to be directed by the President to get ready there is a lot
                            we could do to begin to mount a well planned presentation.</p>

                                corresp="#p_SPS_1">Sarbanes</persName> initiated this meeting with
                            the Secretary to discuss the Administration’s <gloss target="#t_FY_1"
                                >FY</gloss> 1979 budget request for Greece, Turkey and Cyprus and
                            other related subjects. <persName corresp="#p_SPS_1">Paul
                                Sarbanes</persName> opened, saying that the purpose of the visit was
                            to get “your thinking” on the current situation in the Aegean. He said
                            the fiscal ’79 budget request would be the first made by this
                            Administration and would therefore be scrutinized carefully by the
                            Greek-American community and by the countries involved. He realized that
                            the vagaries of the budget cycle had forced difficult decisions on the
                            Administration, perhaps prematurely. Our actions, whether we like it or
                            not, would be read as signals of our intentions.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that both the Greek and Turkish DCAs had been
                            negotiated and are “in place.” The budgetary “numbers” we are
                            considering would represent the amounts necessary for implementation of
                            these agreements. He indicated that were the DCAs not acted upon,
                            “different numbers would be operative.” The major “footnote” to the
                            Administration’s budgetary request was the question of progress on
                            Cyprus. In that regard, we are “cautiously optimistic” that the Turkish
                            government is “getting around to taking serious steps on Cyprus.” We
                            hope to get the intercommunal talks reconvened where discussions can
                            take place on the difficult territorial and constitutional questions. We
                            feel it important that both the Turkish and Greek governments
                            participate in the talks. This is important because of their <pb n="72"
                                facs="0105" xml:id="pg_72"/>ability to exert influence over
                                <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> and the
                            Greek-Cypriot government. So far we have had some expressions of
                            interest on the part of the Greeks but are not sure whether they will
                            agree to participate.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he was meeting with both the Greek and Turkish
                            Foreign Ministers in Brussels and that he would have a better feel for
                            the prospects for progress on Cyprus after those meetings.<note n="2"

                            “line item” on Cyprus, but he was not sure of the amount. If we were to
                            achieve a Cyprus settlement, it may be necessary to request additional
                            appropriations for Cyprus perhaps in a supplemental request.</p>

                                >Sarbanes</persName> said that he was concerned that “the modalities

                                >Kissinger</persName>’s four-year, $1 billion agreement with

                            he said, precludes step-by-step movement toward a settlement in that it
                            restricts our ability to respond. We need to “break out of this pattern”
                            and to “find something short of the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1"
                            >DCA</gloss>” as a response to less than complete movement by the Turks.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BJ_1">Brademas</persName> added that we must
                            consider “a variety of graduated responses,” and adopt an
                            “action-for-action” strategy.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SPS_1">Sarbanes</persName> said that he thought a
                            broader question was involved in that the concept of four-year DCAs is
                            one which should undergo careful scrutiny within the Administration. He
                            said that we are currently burdened by this approach and that countries
                            such as the Philippines and Grenada were able to exert great leverage
                            over us (he added parenthetically that the Prime Minister of Grenada had
                            come to see him recently with a pitch for a multi-year aid contract with
                            the United States for continued use of communications facilities on the
                            island.) He suggested telling the Turks that they were “caught up in a
                            broader policy (re DCAs)” and that the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1"
                                >DCA</gloss> is no longer valid.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he had thought a great deal about the broader
                            problem and believed it would be best to “move away from that pattern.”
                            However, that is a long range issue, and he is not sure that it can be
                            done in this case. He said that he could not give an answer “at this
                            time.” <persName corresp="#p_SPS_1">Sarbanes</persName> reiterated his
                            view that we must find a way to respond if the Turks move some part of
                            the way toward a Cyprus settlement. Failure to approve the <gloss
                                target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>, he said, would not be as traumatic
                            for the Turks were we to place a change of position on the Turkish
                                <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> in the broader framework of a
                            general policy toward DCAs around the world.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_SPS_1">Sarbanes</persName> then asked the
                            Secretary to assess the recent Greek elections. The Secretary said that
                            he was somewhat disappointed with the result, that <persName
                                corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName> suffered some but that he
                            still had a broad margin and should have sufficient power to deal with
                            the problems of his country. He said that it was still too early to see
                            what the election would mean in terms of the US-Greek relationship. We
                            would soon send a new Ambassador to Greece. “As you know, I feel that

                            that our new ambassador is a good choice and that we expect him to be
                            well received. He then asked the two to offer their views on the Greek

                            <persName corresp="#p_SPS_1">Sarbanes</persName> said that he was
                            concerned over the results, that (Andreas) <persName corresp="#p_PA_1"
                                >Papandreou</persName> had “vaulted” into a powerful position using
                            an anti-American theme. This raises questions as to “what happens the
                            next time,” and underscores the urgency of resolving the Cyprus matter.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BJ_1">Brademas</persName> said that <persName

                            expressed concern that we may be taking Greece for granted. In a meeting
                            at the White House some months ago the President appeared “cavalier” in
                            that he seemed to assume that Greece would always be a close ally.<note

                            <persName corresp="#p_BJ_1">Brademas</persName> then asked what the

                                >DCA</gloss>. The Secretary said that he certainly hopes the Greek

                            he would learn more about their position at Brussels. <persName

                            and drop the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>. The Secretary said
                            that he felt this would be interpreted in Greece as a sign of weakness
                            on <persName corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName>’ part since his
                            government had negotiated the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> and
                            had advocated it publicly. <persName corresp="#p_SPS_1"
                                >Sarbanes</persName> disagreed and said that <persName

                            the Turks had a four-year agreement with the United States, Greece
                            should too.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then asked whether a reduction in the period of the Turkish
                                <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> from four to two years would
                            make a difference on the Hill. <persName corresp="#p_SPS_1"
                                >Sarbanes</persName> said that he could not comment on such a
                            proposal without knowing what the Turks were prepared to do on Cyprus.
                            “Let <pb n="74" facs="0107" xml:id="pg_74"/>us assume that the Turks are
                            prepared to undertake real drawdowns and other positive actions on
                            Cyprus,” the Secretary said.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SPS_1">Sarbanes</persName> responded that that did
                            not “get me very far” because a military drawdown on Cyprus would offer
                            the appearance of change with no real change. He said there would be no
                            actual movement on the island in that the Turks would still be able to
                            maintain military control over the Northern sector. Congress went to
                            $175 million (in <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> credits), an
                            increase of 40 percent over the previous amount, and there was still no
                            movement on the part of the Turks. The Greek-American community is now
                            asking why Turkey should get any money in Fiscal 1979. <persName

                            Turkey who told them that Turkey was ready to be helpful on Cyprus.
                            Despite this, he said, there had been no actual movement. “If the Turks
                            really want to do something, fine, but we must match action for action,”
                                <persName corresp="#p_BJ_1">Brademas</persName> said.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then asked the two for their views on what would be an
                            appropriate action by the Turks, “a withdrawal of forces?” <persName
                                corresp="#p_SPS_1">Sarbanes</persName> said that this would not be

                                <persName corresp="#p_BJ_1">Brademas</persName> said that movement
                            must be tangible and irreversible and mentioned reopening the road from

                            restlessness in the Greek-American community. He attributed the
                            restlessness to: (1) the role we played at the United Nations on the
                            Cyprus Resolution this year and our decision to abstain;<note n="6"

                                focused excessively on past tensions instead of looking ahead to
                                future solutions. The United States also objected that the
                                Resolution artificially inflated the threat of the Cyprus dispute to

                            is now. The Secretary said that we have made it clear to the Turks that
                            they must move now. In spite of Demirel’s weak government, we hoped that
                            Turkey would still be able to move on Cyprus.</p>

                                >Kyprianou</persName> has indicated that he would be somewhat

                            movement on Cyprus and that their inaction had made it difficult for him
                            and other Members of Congress to justify the increase to $175 million.

                            significant in that they held the promise of additional movement. He
                            said that they recently agreed to allow Greek hotel owners to move back

                            that it was important to retain these amounts in the budget “as a

                                <persName corresp="#p_BJ_1">Brademas</persName> said that he thought
                            that approach might be workable but that the descriptive language used

                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> with Turkey was negotiated in
                            the winter of 1975–76 and signed in March 1976. The <gloss
                                target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> with Greece was negotiated in part in
                            1976, then held up for nearly a year by the Greeks and completed only in
                            the summer of 1977. It was initialled on 28 July 1977 but <persName
                                corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName> has delayed signing it.</p>
                        <p>Both DCAs replaced earlier agreements which were declared invalid in the
                            wake of the Cyprus crisis of 1974. Both involved months of difficult,
                            detailed negotiation over the exact status of our military installations
                            in Greece and Turkey, import and export of equipment and supplies,
                            status of our personnel, communications arrangements, rights of access
                                [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] and some
                            supporting facilities by the Greeks and Turks. In both countries four
                            major installa<pb n="77" facs="0110" xml:id="pg_77"/>tions and two dozen
                            minor and auxiliary installations are covered. In both countries the
                            negotiations involved a serious process of give-and-take but the
                            agreements which emerged are sound and clear, and we feel they protect
                            our basic interests effectively, while at the same time providing the
                            basis for real, constructive cooperation with our two allies. They are
                            better than what we had before.</p>
                        <p>Both agreements include commitments to supply military assistance: $700
                            million over four years for Greece and $1 billion over four years for
                            Turkey. Per capita and in terms of the size of their armed forces, the
                            provision of aid is more generous for Greece than for Turkey.</p>
                        <p>The importance of the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> to the Turks
                            goes well beyond its specific provisions. They see it as evidence of our
                            basic politico-military commitment to them as allies and as
                            reaffirmation of their status as full members of the western alliance.
                            The Greeks are less emotionally attached to their <gloss
                                target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>—and have shown themselves willing to
                            delay every step connected with it as a means of forestalling
                            restoration of the Turkish-American relationship.</p>
                        <p>If we were to abandon the DCAs the Greeks would see this as a triumph
                            over the Turks and the Turks would feel outwitted by the Greeks.
                            Relations between the two countries would be seriously damaged. If the
                            Turkish <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> were presented separately
                            to the Congress and rejected, the Turks would consider the American
                            alliance as it has existed for 30 years at an end and might leave <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>. The Greeks do not see their <gloss
                                target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> as essential to the preservation of
                            their relationship with the United States, but <persName
                                corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName> must recognize that the
                                <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> provides the most practical
                            avenue for reassociating Greece with the United States and with <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>. If the Turkish <gloss
                                target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> is separately ratified, Greek interest
                            in having theirs signed and ratified will doubtlessly increase
                            sharply.</p>
                        <p>Ratification of both DCAs is the most clear-cut and evenhanded way of
                            laying the basis for settlement of Greek-Turkish differences and
                            restoration of both these countries to full participation in the western
                            alliance and the European and North Atlantic communities.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The Secretary described his more than two hours’ conversation with
                                <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> where they had talked
                            of global, regional, and bilateral issues. On the matters of immediate
                            interest, <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> said he was
                            determined to get the Cyprus issue settled so that it would not
                            interfere with the economic, social, and other priority issues which now
                            faced Turkey. He said he intended to be an activist and would have new
                            proposals for both the territorial and constitutional issues in Cyprus.
                            He had discussed his ideas with <persName corresp="#p_DR_1"
                                >Denktash</persName> who is in agreement on their substance. His
                            territorial proposal might not offer as much as the Greek Cypriots would
                            like at the outset of their discussions, but it would be a genuine offer
                            and a basis for negotiation. On the constitutional side he thought it
                            should be a federal and not a confederal system and his proposal would
                            be a real practical basis for resolving the situation. Cyprus, as he
                            said several times, was a thorn that had to be removed so that Turkey
                            could deal with issues that were more vital to Turkish needs.</p>
                        <p>As for the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>, <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> hoped the question would be
                            resolved soon. The Secretary told <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                >Ecevit</persName> that he was proceeding on the assumption that he,
                                <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>, knew that this issue
                            was linked to the situation in Cyprus and it was simply a matter of fact
                            that this relationship was much in the minds of Congressmen. <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> said that the <gloss
                                target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> was outmoded and not really fair to
                            the Turks because the dollar had depreci<pb n="79" facs="0112"
                                xml:id="pg_79"/>ated and arms cost more and maybe it should be
                            looked at again. The Secretary had responded that if the <gloss
                                target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> were opened up, it was unrealistic to
                            think that the result would be any increased amounts; that was a simple
                            fact of life. We had endorsed the Turkish <gloss target="#t_DCA_1"
                                >DCA</gloss> in principle and the decision as to when it would move
                            in Congress was related to the events in the Eastern Mediterranean, as
                            we had made clear to the previous Turkish administration and to the
                            Turkish Ambassador.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that in Greece he had a lengthy and useful discussion
                            with <persName corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName>. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName> explained that from his
                            point of view Cyprus was at the core of his difficulties with Turkey and
                            with the Greek-<gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> relationship. He
                            would like to have the Cyprus issue resolved, but he was inclined to
                            doubt the Turks would put a serious proposal on the table. The Secretary
                            explained to <persName corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName> what
                                <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> had said to him and
                                <persName corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName> responded that if
                            it should turn out that way, he would try to get Cyprus resolved, which
                            in turn could clear the way to reintegrate the Greek forces into <gloss

                            view the Aegean was more important than Cyprus. The Secretary told
                                <persName corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName> that he was
                            pleased that the two sides planned to resume their Paris discussions on
                            this issue on February 12 and asked what he proposed to do about
                                <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>’s offer for a summit.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName> had responded that
                            if something useful were to come, he would favor it, but he did have
                            questions. Did <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> have the
                            power to deliver? Was he sincere about trying to resolve the
                            difficulties? The Secretary pointed out that it would be possible to
                            have lower level talks to test the way, and if these proved encouraging,
                            he could go ahead at the top. (He commented to the Congressmen that he
                            was encouraged that now publicly <persName corresp="#p_CC_1"
                                >Caramanlis</persName> has followed this line.)</p>
                        <p>In general he said <persName corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName>’
                            mood was very good, optimistic, positive, and friendly. In fact, much
                            the same could be said of <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>.
                            Both urged that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> should not try
                            to play a direct role, but should be available to help if asked. The
                            Secretary said he made it clear that we are available to assist the U.N.
                            Secretary General and the parties if they wish, but we looked to them to
                            work it out.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary observed that his own feeling was that <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> had more to him than <persName
                                corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName> seemed to think at this
                            point. He believed that <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>,
                            who was a very bright man, really wanted to resolve the issues.</p>

                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BJ_1">Brademas</persName> asked if the Secretary
                            had made it clear to the Turks that linkage really remains a fact of
                            life here. The Secretary replied that insofar as Congress is concerned,
                            it was clear that there is linkage. <persName corresp="#p_BJ_1"
                                >Brademas</persName> noted that this Administration had inherited
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>’s <gloss
                                target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>-or-nothing framework and now that
                                <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> had raised
                            renegotiating the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>, he suggested we
                            could pick that up and find some way to get out of the four-year <gloss
                                target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> framework. The Secretary replied that
                            what <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> wanted was another
                            agreement with more money so renegotiating the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1"
                                >DCA</gloss> would not be helpful. We didn’t like the four-year
                            packages, but the arrangements with Spain, Turkey, Greece, and possibly
                            the Philippines were there and we were stuck with them. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BJ_1">Brademas</persName> persisted that if we wanted to
                            find a handle to move to another arrangement, <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> has provided an opening.</p>
                        <p>He then turned to the <gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss> and suggested
                            that the <gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss> people could tell the
                            Turks that they have a lot of extra expenses with their forces in
                            Cyprus. <persName corresp="#p_BJ_1">Brademas</persName> had the
                            impression that we had not done much with the economic weapon.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary interjected that he had raised with <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> the question of reducing the
                            number of years in the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>, and
                                <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> had replied it simply
                            would be disastrous and give the impression of a lack of <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> commitment and continuity in <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> policy.</p>
                        <p>Returning to linkage, <persName corresp="#p_BJ_1">Brademas</persName>
                            asked if he could say that he had been assured by the Administration
                            that there was no change in our policy and that the <gloss
                                target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> was linked to progress in Cyprus. The
                            Secretary replied that we had never said that, so the answer was no. He
                            went on: There would be hearings in the spring and the issue would come
                            up at that time. He would have to see what was put on the table by the
                            Turks and the others and after being in touch with the Congressmen, he
                            would then make his final decision. <persName corresp="#p_BJ_1"
                                >Brademas</persName> said that he recalled a meeting with the
                            President who had told him, “I can’t say it publicly, but I am telling
                            you there is a linkage.” He said he would like to say that the President
                            had made a campaign pledge to that effect and that he believed him. He
                            displayed a Greek-American newspaper with the headline, “Now it’s tricky
                            Jimmy.” The Secretary said it should be clear that when we see what is
                            on the table we, after consulting with the Congressmen, will decide what
                            the Administration will do.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SPS_1">Sarbanes</persName> interjected that he was
                            worried about <persName corresp="#p_PA_1">Papandreou</persName>’s
                            strength at the last election, which he understood had been heavily
                            financed by <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>. He was
                            concerned about the long-run situation in Greece. We don’t know what
                                <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> will put on the table.
                            We don’t like four-year agreements, but if the Cyprus situation is
                            resolved, we will be back to square one. He could see that eventually he
                            and the Administration could differ in judgment as to whether what
                                <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> put on <pb n="81"
                                facs="0114" xml:id="pg_81"/>the table was or was not reasonable.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SPS_1">Sarbanes</persName> went on that it did
                            not help to have <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>,
                            reinforced by the Pentagon, make statements favoring early action for
                            Turkey. This gave a picture of the Administration playing a double game.
                            He emphasized at once, however, that he did not attribute this to the
                            Secretary. However, he continued, the Administration’s approach was a
                            carrot and stick approach, and the military seem disposed to give the
                            carrot right away and try to end-run Congress. How optimistic, he said,
                            was the Secretary?</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied he could not say yet but, on the basis of what
                                <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> had told him, he felt that
                                <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> really wanted to get
                            the Cyprus issue out of the way. He thought <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                >Ecevit</persName> was sincere. <persName corresp="#p_CC_1"
                                >Caramanlis</persName> was doubtful, but was ready to explore the
                            possibilities. On constitutional issues he thought the proposal would be
                            forthcoming. On the territorial one the initial proposal would be at
                            least a fair beginning. That was his guess. On the <gloss
                                target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> he anticipated doing nothing on the
                            Hill before March. That would give time for the <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> proposals to be looked at in
                            February. <persName corresp="#p_SPS_1">Sarbanes</persName> returned to
                            his point that he was concerned that the Turks would look forthcoming
                            and Congress would be on the spot to give away its billion dollar
                            decision prematurely before we knew where the Turkish negotiations would
                            lead. The Secretary responded that until he saw what was on the table he
                            could not answer. <persName corresp="#p_RBS_1">Rosenthal</persName>
                            reinforced <persName corresp="#p_SPS_1">Sarbanes</persName>’ point and
                            said that once Congress had acted it would have no more carrot and the
                            Turks would only be midstream in the negotiations. The Secretary
                            responded that it really depended on momentum of events in the Eastern
                            Mediterranean. That was as close as he could go to linkage, and we had
                            explained before why we did not wish to go beyond that.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary circulated the figures that would be going up in the budget
                            for Greece and Turkey. He thought that the arrangement had been worked
                            out properly with lower numbers in the proposal and higher numbers in
                            the footnote, following the Congressmen’s suggestion from their last
                            meeting.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary noted that he had asked <persName corresp="#p_CC_1"
                                >Caramanlis</persName> what was his approach to the Greek <gloss
                                target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_CC_1"
                                >Caramanlis</persName> had said that although he might change his
                            mind, at that point he did not think he could go forward with it until
                            he had resolved the Greece-<gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                            relationship, and he could not resolve that until he had settled Cyprus.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BJ_1">Brademas</persName> observed that if the
                            Administration decided to push for the Turkish <gloss target="#t_DCA_1"
                                >DCA</gloss> and not the Greek <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>,
                            there would be all hell to pay on the Hill. He hoped we would not get
                            into this jam. The Secretary shared the hope.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary noted that the Turks would like follow-on discussions on
                            bilateral issues and in the course of that discussion he, the Secretary,
                            had urged the Foreign Minister to face up to their economic situation in
                            relation to the <gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss> review. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BJ_1">Brademas</persName> appreciated the fact that <pb
                                n="82" facs="0115" xml:id="pg_82"/>the Secretary had brought up
                            economics and the <gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss> with both
                                <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> and the Foreign
                            Minister.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_SPS_1">Sarbanes</persName> asked if the
                            Turks appreciated that if Cyprus were settled, the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Turkish relationship would be okay,
                            and the Secretary said yes. Particularly this was true of <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>, who was a sophisticated man.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BJ_1">Brademas</persName>, trying again, asked
                            if <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> is so important, why couldn’t
                            we urge <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> to be much more
                            forthcoming, implying that otherwise there might be a question of <gloss
                                target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss> help and arms. The Secretary responded

                        <p>The Secretary concluded that all concerned recognized this was a critical

                            and he had to be the men to settle things. He liked <persName

                                >Brademas</persName> noted that on several occasions recently

                            to them to work under the aegis of the United Nations. We agreed to do
                            so, but stand ready to assist if the United Nations and the concerned

                        </list>
                        <p>Congressional hearings have been scheduled during the first week of April
                            at which the Administration will be expected to present its program on
                            Greek and Turkish military assistance, and in particular its approach to
                            the Turkish embargo and the four-year, $1 billion Defense Cooperation
                            Agreement (<gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>). The embargo (Section
                            620(x) of the Foreign Assistance Act) was imposed by the Congress as a
                            result of the 1974 Turkish military operations in Cyprus. We have
                            endorsed the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> in principle, but have
                            not requested Congressional action; there has been an implicit
                            linkage—never publicly articulated—that our decision on the <gloss
                                target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> was related to positive Turkish
                            movement on a Cyprus settlement. However, we have also stressed the
                            importance of our bilateral relationship with Turkey and its major role
                            in <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>There is a general consensus in State, shared I believe by other
                            departments and agencies, that if we fail to restore the Turkish
                            relationship this year, these relations will deteriorate rapidly and may
                            lead to unfortunate actions by the <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                >Ecevit</persName> government with respect to our bases and military
                            presence in Turkey, Turkey’s commitment to <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss>, and Turkey’s general Western orientation. On the
                            other side, the Greeks and Cypriots would have a strong negative
                            reaction, as would important <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            constituencies, if we moved to a full restoration of the Turkish
                            relationship at a time when substantial progress on Cyprus has not yet
                            occurred. (Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>
                            has given public and private assurances that the Turkish Cypriots will
                            present meaningful proposals to <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1"
                                >Waldheim</persName> shortly, but we have no assurance as to the
                            timing or the contents of these proposals.)</p>
                        <p>Three possible courses of action which we have considered are the
                            following:</p>

                        <p>Request the Congress to repeal the embargo (Section 620(x)) and approve
                            the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>. At the same time, we would

                        </p>
                        <p>—This approach would clearly please the Turks and, if successful, would
                            ensure their continued Western orientation.</p>
                        <p>—It will face up fully to the issue of our Turkish relationship and allow
                            us to fight the battle on the Hill in terms of basic United States
                            interests in the region and not on the substance of the Cyprus
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>—It would lead to the re-opening of our intelligence bases in Turkey and

                        <p>—It may in the long run promote a Cyprus settlement because, assuming the
                            Turkish authorities present reasonable opening proposals, the lifting of
                            the embargo and passage of the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>
                            would make the Cypriots more willing to negotiate realistically.</p>

                            positive Cyprus proposals.</p>
                        <p>—It introduces the troublesome factor of a four-year base agreement which
                            many Members of Congress will oppose regardless of the country
                            involved.</p>
                        <p>—It imposes on the Administration a major battle in Congress at a time
                            when we are trying to reduce the number of open and difficult issues on

                        <p>—It will strain our relations with Greece and Cyprus and perhaps make

                        </p>
                        <p>—Lifting of the embargo deals with the major irritant in US-Turkish
                            relations. Both sides could benefit by the decision to re-negotiate the
                                <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>—The package addresses Turkey’s economic needs—something which the <gloss
                                target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> itself does not do.</p>
                        <p>—It is the kind of package which can be defended on its own merits in the
                            Congress, since it is something we have put together ourselves based on
                            our evaluation of the current circumstances.</p>
                        <p>—The package avoids a four-year, $1 billion commitment to Turkey, a
                            commitment many on the Hill oppose because of its precedent-setting
                            character.</p>
                        <p>—Since <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> did not negotiate
                            the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> and has occasionally criticized
                            it, our willingness to re-negotiate the document could be useful to

                            virtually certain to fight this package hard.</p>
                        <p>—In the continuing absence of a <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>, the
                            Turks may decide not to open our intelligence bases.</p>

                            upgrade the Turkish military establishment would be delayed.</p>
                        <p>—This approach may require another Congressional fight next year if a new

                            in Cyprus in the meantime may reduce this possibility.</p>

                            would re-assess their over-all security arrangements which risks a
                            loosening of Turkey’s ties with <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                            and with the West generally and a subsequent movement toward a more
                            neutralist approach.</p>
                        <p>—Media and Congressional reaction in the event Turkey reduced its links
                            with <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> and the West could provoke
                            unpleasant hearings critical of our Eastern Mediterranean policy
                            approach.</p>

                        <p>—Maintaining the embargo is unlikely to help solve Cyprus: On the
                            contrary, it might provoke the Turks to withdraw their proposals and
                            refuse to negotiate with the Cypriots; the Turks could even take out
                            their frustration by adopting a less compromising attitude toward
                            Greece.</p>

                                the Aegean have triggered significant changes in the two countries’
                                broader foreign policies. Their efforts to outmaneuver each other
                                have weakened <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>’s southeastern
                                flank and disrupted the harmony of the Western defense and economic
                                systems in general. At the same time, the critical importance to
                                both countries of their Western ties puts limits on how far they can
                                go. Neither—but especially the Greeks—can afford to leave the field
                                to its rival by bolting the West altogether. And Turkey will be
                                cautious in pursuing its self-proclaimed intention to adopt a more
                                independent foreign policy.</hi>

                        <p>When Greece and Turkey have quarreled in the past they have moved in
                            fairly predictable ways. The pattern followed by the Greeks has been to
                            secure external involvement, believing that this can only help them
                            against their more powerful adversary. This strategy has served them
                            well. Their independence from the Ottomans and all subsequent recoveries
                            of territories from the Turks have been won with the help of outside
                            intervention.</p>
                        <p>Precisely because of the Greeks’ success, the Turks for their part, have

                            with the Greeks. Indeed, it is their experience of constantly being
                            “ganged up” on by the West that accounts for the Turks’ [<hi

                            compensated for by a concerted drive to “join Western Europe” by way of
                            membership in the European Community. While that move is aimed mainly at
                            bolstering Greece’s economy and its Western democratic tradition, it is
                            also seen by Greeks as another “security blanket” of sorts against the
                            Turks. In that context, the rush to join is part of the broader
                            Greek-Turkish rivalry.</p>
                        <p>The Turks, on the other hand, have consistently maintained that
                            Greek-Turkish problems must not be linked to Turkey’s relations with its
                            US and West European allies. Believing that Turkey has other options by
                            virtue of its size and strategic location, the Demirel government
                            underscored this point in 1975 by suspending US base operations in
                            Turkey in response to the Congressionally imposed arms embargo. Beyond
                            that, the Turks have sought to counter Greek maneuvering within the
                            Western orbit with some of their own. They have tried to obstruct
                            Greece’s effort to negotiate a new relationship with <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>, in part because of a genuine
                            concern that the Greeks are trying to get a free ride but also in
                            retaliation for Greek lobbying in behalf of the US arms embargo.</p>
                        <p>And while the Turks have not officially opposed Greece’s prospective
                            membership in the <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss>, they are clearly
                            upset at the prospect of being isolated from that institution and they
                            have insisted that the Community must include Turkey in its political
                            consultative process once the Greeks get in.<note n="2" xml:id="d21fn2"
                                >The Greek Parliament ratified Greece’s accession to the European
                                Community on June 28, 1979, and Greece officially became a member on
                                January 1, 1981.</note> More important, the Turks have sought to
                            increase their leverage with their allies—and also to carve a new niche
                            for Turkey in international politics—by dangling the threat of a further
                            loosening of ties to the West and a closer relationship with the Soviet
                            Union and the Third World.</p>

                        <p>Greece, on the other hand, has been reluctant to wander outside the
                            Western orbit because of the close cultural, ideological, economic, and
                            security ties with the West that prompted <persName corresp="#p_DJF_1"
                                >John Foster Dulles</persName> to refer to Greece as a “hooked
                            fish.” <persName corresp="#p_DJF_1">Dulles</persName> was speaking in
                            the context of the East-West conflict; but the fact is even more
                            relevant in the Greek-Turkish rivalry since the Greeks cannot afford to
                            concede Western support to the Turks. Indeed, “We belong to the West”
                            has been a consistent slogan of the <persName corresp="#p_CC_1"
                                >Caramanlis</persName> government even as it seeks to bring pressure
                            to bear on the West to do its bidding toward the Turks.</p>
                        <pb n="90" facs="0123" xml:id="pg_90"/>
                        <p>Because of this sentiment, the Greeks have allowed US bases to operate
                            relatively unimpeded despite their unhappiness with the US response to
                            their case against the Turks. And most recently, Greek reaction to the
                            Administration’s decision to press for a lifting of the embargo against
                            Turkey has been rather muted and will probably remain so even if
                            Congress lifts the embargo.</p>
                        <p>Nor has the <persName corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName> government
                            felt very comfortable outside of <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                            >NATO</gloss>’s integrated military command. A trend toward slowly
                            bringing Greece back into the alliance began in 1976 when most of the
                            Greeks’ nuclear-capable forces were earmarked for <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> use. This was followed by a decision
                            last fall to participate selectively in alliance military exercises. It
                            culminated in a decision last winter to seek full reentry in all but
                            name as soon as possible. To be sure, the latter was also prompted by
                            indications from some West European leaders that Greece’s <gloss
                                target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> application might be processed more
                            speedily were it to return to <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> as
                            well as Greek concern that Turkey was dominating the alliance’s
                            southeastern flank by default. Indeed, the question of naval command and
                            air control in the Aegean are emerging as the major stumbling blocks in
                            the Greek-<gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> negotiations, with the
                            Greeks insisting that their former authority in these areas be restored
                            once they return, and the Turks in particular opposing such a move.</p>
                        <p>Greece’s troubles with its allies have not led to any noticeable
                            improvement in Greece’s relations with the Soviet Union. The staunch
                            anticommunism of the Greek political, military, and economic elite, the
                            Communist civil war experience, and Moscow’s courting of the Turks are
                            the reasons. And while there may be a slight thaw in the relationship
                            when Greek Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_RG_1"
                                >Rallis</persName> goes to Moscow this summer to sign some minor
                            cultural, consular, and trade agreements, Greek-Soviet relations are not
                            likely to improve substantially. On the other hand, <persName
                                corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName> by his “Balkan initiative”
                            has tried to bring about a greater measure of cooperation between Greece
                            and its Balkan Communist neighbors. Designed to secure Greece’s flank in
                            the event of a clash with Turkey and often resorted to by Greek leaders
                            in the past in times of Greek-Turkish friction, the effort has been most
                            successful with Yugoslavia, with which the Greeks have developed closer
                            political, economic, and even a limited amount of military cooperation.
                            Lately, Greek-Albanian relations have also improved.</p>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] But it will
                            remain so only so long as it is ruled by conservatives or centrists—such
                            as <persName corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName> and his
                            colleagues—who are committed to the West. Someone like leftist

                                Papandreou</persName> might seek permanently looser ties with the US

                            prospects will depend in part on the Greek electorate’s perception of

                            military presumably would be a constraint on <persName corresp="#p_PA_1"
                                >Papandreou</persName>, but the officer corps might itself acquiesce
                            in a reduction of ties to the West in the event of another humiliation
                            by Turkey to which it felt the West was unresponsive.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Turkey More Assertive</p>
                        <p>The Demirel government only flirted with the idea of loosening Turkey’s
                            ties to the West; the independent-minded <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                >Ecevit</persName> is considering it more seriously. But there is a
                            good deal of posturing in <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                            >Ecevit</persName>’s statements. He is fully cognizant that the
                            alternatives to Turkey’s economic and military ties with the West are
                            limited. Moreover, both he and the majority of the Turkish elite prize
                            their self image as “Western” and “European”.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> has talked about adopting
                            a “new defense concept” for Turkey. The concept’s meaning seems to have
                            been left purposefully vague; essentially, however, it envisages a role
                            for Turkey similar to that of the French in <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss> or the Romanians in the Warsaw Pact. <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> has noted, for example, that
                            although Turkey will both of necessity and choice, remain within the
                            Western defense and economic systems, it must not act as a military
                            bastion or agent of the West in its region. Moreover, Turkey should make
                            its “own contribution to detente” by reducing tensions in its area and
                            improving relations with the Soviet Union. A corollary is the effort to
                            develop closer political and economic relations with Arab and other
                            Third World states—an effort that has produced few political or economic
                            results so far. Always implicit and sometimes explicit are possible
                            reductions in Turkey’s commitment to <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss>, in the size of the US or <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss> presence in Turkey, and in the size of Turkey’s armed
                            forces.</p>
                        <p>The extent to which <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>
                            implements his new approach will depend in the first place on whether
                            the US arms embargo is lifted. If it is not, <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                >Ecevit</persName> would find it difficult politically and
                            psychologically not to take further retaliatory measures, focusing on
                            the US bases in Turkey or on Turkey’s commitment to <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>. Whatever he chose to do, his moves
                            would probably be tempered by the recent willingness of Western
                            governments and financial institutions to help bail out the faltering
                            Turkish economy, which is a far more serious issue in the short term for
                            Turkey than that of arms. They have offered to provide substantial
                            credits and to refinance part of Turkey’s sizeable short and mid-term
                            debt. An even more important reason for Turkish caution is that Turkey
                            will need additional credits and refinancing to solve its economic
                            problems.</p>
                        <p>Turkey in fact remains heavily dependent on the West in many important
                            ways, and <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> will have to
                            take this fact into account as he tries to assert a greater degree of
                            autonomy. Turkey needs Western <pb n="92" facs="0125" xml:id="pg_92"
                            />credits and hard currency to meet its development needs in amounts
                            which the Soviet Union has been unable or unwilling to supply despite
                            its economic largesse to Turkey in other ways. Turkey, moreover, does
                            not have a viable alternative to Western, and particularly US, arms.
                                [<hi rend="italic">2 lines not declassified</hi>]—and the military
                            balance would doubtless tilt toward Greece while the process was
                            underway. Even if they could set aside their historic suspicion of the
                            Soviets, the Turks would be reluctant to pay the political price that
                            Moscow would almost certainly demand for such vast amounts of economic
                            and military assistance. <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>,
                            therefore, is unlikely during his widely publicized visit next month to
                            Moscow to enter into any agreements with the Soviet Union that would be
                            incompatible with Turkey’s continued membership in <gloss

                            is not much likelier for Turkey than it is for Greece. Meanwhile, until

                            and disrupt Western institutions.</p>

                        <p>In our efforts to secure repeal of the Turkish arms embargo, we have
                            consistently stressed that lifting the embargo is only the essential <pb
                                n="93" facs="0126" xml:id="pg_93"/>first step toward breaking the
                            impasse in the Eastern Mediterranean. In light of the expectations in
                            the Congress and the region of new American initiatives, alone or in
                            conjunction with others, it is important that we begin moving promptly
                            once we are sure of the ultimate result in the Congress. There is a
                            strong assumption that the United States will mount an active offensive
                            to obtain early progress on Cyprus. There is also a clear expectation
                            that embargo repeal will lead to the expeditious opening of <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> facilities in Turkey. Action geared
                            toward reducing the negative impact of the lifting of the embargo in
                            Greece and Cyprus is also anticipated.</p>
                        <p>In charting a comprehensive strategy toward the area in the immediate
                            aftermath of embargo repeal as well as over the next several months, we
                            need a clear understanding of our priorities and ways to deal with them
                            effectively.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName> and the Greek
                            Government appear reconciled to repeal of the embargo, although to
                            deflect opposition, media, and public concern they will continue to
                            criticize our action, probably in muted, cautious tones. Most
                            importantly, the Greeks will seek in the period following the lifting of
                            the embargo to achieve several priority political goals: namely, they
                            will expect the United States to pressure the Turks to accommodate Greek
                            conditions for its return to <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>;
                            they will anticipate a more active <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            role in extracting meaningful Turkish concessions on Cyprus; they will
                            attempt to get <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> support in their
                            Aegean differences with Turkey; and they will want to maintain the
                            current military balance with Turkey.</p>
                        <p>In the period following embargo repeal, <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                >Ecevit</persName> will expect and welcome an active <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> effort to bring Turkey back toward a
                            full contribution to the Alliance. He will probably accept <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> activities to promote progress on
                            Cyprus. The Turks, however, will be very wary of any such effort which
                            seems to represent new heavy pressure. They have also listened carefully
                            to some of the arguments made to and in the Congress regarding the
                            woeful shape of the Turkish defense structure and the extremely
                            important geographic and military contribution which Turkey makes to the
                            West. These arguments will lead them to expect a significant level of
                            military assistance in 1980. <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                >Ecevit</persName> will also seek to find ways to show that his
                            interest in revitalizing the Turkish-American relationship has borne
                            fruit beyond the simple removal of the negative symbolism which the
                            embargo had come to represent. In this regard, the Turks will
                            particularly seek commitments of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            and Allied economic and financial assistance to help overcome their
                            continuing severe economic difficulties. The Turks will expect us to
                            insist on immediate reopening of our facilities in Turkey, but may try
                            to bargain this against <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> military
                            supply and/or economic aid. While negotia<pb n="94" facs="0127"
                                xml:id="pg_94"/>tions will undoubtedly prove to be difficult, we
                            hope to achieve rapid resumption of activities at these facilities.</p>
                        <p>The Greek Cypriots will be bitter and resentful in the wake of repeal of
                            the embargo. Given their apparently genuine belief in its efficacy as a
                            pressure tactic, they cannot but regard removal of the embargo as a
                            severe setback to their hopes, rather than as an opportunity for
                            progress. There is likely to be a temporary surge in anti-Americanism in
                            the press and in the political realm. However, many responsible
                            political and Foreign Ministry people believe that, having eliminated
                            the embargo, the United States will have assumed a much greater burden
                            of responsibility vis-a-vis Cyprus. This may well be translated into an
                            expectation that we will now exert much heavier pressure on Turkey. We
                            anticipate that <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName>,
                                <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName>, <persName

                            work actively with us to lay the foundation for a resumption of talks
                            and will want to share their views and ideas with us.<note n="2"

                        <p>While the Turkish Cypriots will be pleased with removal of the embargo,
                            it is unlikely that this step alone will induce them to be more flexible
                            and conciliatory towards the Greek Cypriots. Ankara will have to
                            continue to exert determined and consistent pressure but both the Turks
                            and the Turkish Cypriots may resist <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            and/or Western European efforts to become more actively involved in the

                        <p>It is obvious that these objectives must be approached over different
                            time periods. For example, negotiations with Turkey on reopening the
                            facilities and an effort to facilitate <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss> re-entry should resume very quickly; a Cyprus
                            settlement will certainly not be achieved this year, but progress on
                            Varosha could be significant. As we move forward to improve our
                            relations with all countries, we must be careful that in seeking to
                            achieve one goal we do not jeopardize opportunities with respect to
                            others. In addition, we must be aware of the limitations of our
                            influence and the risk of interjecting ourselves too directly in the
                            substance of Greek/Turkish bilateral disputes.</p>

                            our strong desire for early Cyprus progress (particularly Varosha), and
                            the importance to us of early base reopening. On the latter point,
                            negotiating instructions are being prepared in State/Defense, and we
                            plan to send a team to start negotiations very soon.<note n="7"

                            France and Canada to work together on the Cyprus problem and preliminary

                            possible meeting of experts in Washington or London in September.
                            Further consultations on this process should be undertaken without

                        <p>c) We know that elements of the Cypriot Government, including even

                            the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> can really achieve movement
                            toward a Cyprus solution. We have been told that an early visit to
                            Cyprus would be welcome by the Cypriot Government and also demonstrate
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> concern. Such a visit should be
                            considered for an early date, perhaps early September, or even during
                            the week following the embargo vote. <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clark
                                Clifford</persName> has been perceived during the Congressional
                            debate as rather pro-Turkish and I doubt that we should risk sending him
                            to the island when the Greek Cypriots will publicly be feeling
                            antagonistic towards us. I would suggest instead that we discuss with
                            the Cypriots the idea of my making the trip with a very small team. We
                            would sound out the parties on Cyprus and try to lay the groundwork for
                            our future activities.</p>
                        <p>4. Consideration should also be given to visits to Greece and Turkey in
                            the near future, perhaps in conjunction with a Cyprus trip. Discussions
                            with the Turks on the base agreement, <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss> military cooperation and similar subjects would be
                            useful. We will want particularly both in Ankara and in Brussels to make
                            clear that it is important to <pb n="97" facs="0130" xml:id="pg_97"/>see
                            early positive movement of Greece into <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss>. A high-level visit to Greece would help further to
                            reassure the Greeks of our general approach to the area. A political
                            visit in the region by the Vice President should also be considered for
                            1979, depending on progress in various areas.<note n="10"

                            should continue to welcome and encourage the current promising dialogue
                            which is taking place at several levels. We should, however, not involve
                            ourselves in the substance of the various issues since to do so would
                            involve taking sides and getting into very intricate and controversial
                            issues.</p>

                        <p>Summary: Recent conversations with Greeks, Turks, and Soviets in Moscow
                            reveal an awareness that subtle shifts in Eastern Mediterranean-Soviet
                            relationships are taking place, but also indicate a lack of agreement on
                            what those shifts might be. Attention in this vacation month is now
                            focused on the historic visit of the Greek Foreign Minister in early
                            September—a visit which, because it is an historical <pb n="98"
                                facs="0131" xml:id="pg_98"/>first and because it comes at a time of
                            regional change, may assume a public significance larger than it would
                            otherwise merit. End summary.</p>
                        <p>1. Within the past few days Embassy officers have had private discussions
                            with Turkish Embassy Counselor <persName corresp="#p_BM_3"
                                >Bilhan</persName>, Greek Embassy <gloss target="#t_DCM_1"
                                >DCM</gloss> Botzaris, and <gloss target="#t_MFA_1">MFA</gloss>
                            Fifth European Dept. Counselor Pushkin (Greece-Cyprus). All were
                            preoccupied with the impending visit of the Greek Foreign Minister as
                            seen against the background of the lifting of the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> arms embargo against Turkey and
                                <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>’s visit to the Soviet
                            Union. All professed to see <persName corresp="#p_RG_1"
                                >Rallis</persName>’ visit as a “normal” step in the four year long
                            process of improved Greek-Soviet relations, but all admitted that the
                            visit and the visit communique would be particularly significant at this
                                time.<note n="3" xml:id="d23fn3">
                                <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> left Athens on
                                September 4 for a six-day visit to the Soviet Union. The trip marked
                                the first time a Greek Foreign Minister visited the Soviet Union
                                since the two countries established diplomatic relations in 1924.
                                The Greek and Soviet Governments issued a joint communiqué on
                                September 11 which underscored improved relations recently forged
                                between the two countries.</note> They saw this as so not only
                            because of the precedent-setting nature of any “first” visit, but also,
                            and more important, because of the uncertain nature of the subtly
                            changing pattern of inter-relationships in the Eastern Mediterranean set
                            in motion by the <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> visit and
                            the lifting of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> arms
                            embargo.</p>
                        <p>2. The Greek <gloss target="#t_DCM_1">DCM</gloss> felt that <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> had sold his political
                            birthright for a mess of Soviet economic pottage. Botzaris questioned
                            the scale and the significance of the Soviet-Turkish economic
                            relationship, and he felt that the Soviet-Turkish political document
                            gave Moscow a handle with which to press the Turks on the issue of the
                            reopening of certain <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> intelligence
                            gathering bases in Turkey. He thought <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                >Ecevit</persName> might, in turn, use this Soviet pressure as an
                            excuse to resist the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> desire that
                            the bases be activated.</p>
                        <p>3. It is true that Moscow is greatly concerned over the possibility of
                            the reopening of the bases. In an unusual manner, the Soviet central
                            press (<hi rend="italic">Pravda,</hi> Aug. 3; <hi rend="italic">Krasnaya
                                Zvezda</hi>, Aug. 5) has spoken openly of this likelihood, and
                            Turkish Counselor <persName corresp="#p_BM_3">Bilhan</persName> has told
                            us that the Soviets have shown “anxiety” about this in numerous working
                            level conversations here. Oddly enough, however, the TASS article which
                            has caused such a stir in Turkey (Ref A, B) has not, to the best of our
                            knowledge, been released here and certainly has not been reported in the
                            Soviet central press. Since Embassy did not receive Ankara’s 5643 which
                            reported this article, we are not able to comment on the article
                                itself.<note n="4" xml:id="d23fn4">In telegram 5643 from Ankara,
                                August 6, the Embassy noted the TASS article with two headlines

                        <p>4. Our Turkish source told us that, as a result of the improvement of

                            chill has set in with regard to Soviet-Turkish relations. For example,
                            repeated Turkish requests to begin negotiations on the flight
                            information region have gone unanswered. On the other hand, according to

                            understandings reached during Ecevit’s visit are moving forward on
                            schedule and plans are being made for a meeting of the Joint Economic
                            Commission in Moscow in late September–early October.</p>
                        <p>5. While there is some disagreement among our interlocutors about
                            Moscow’s present evaluation of the Cyprus situation, all agree that
                            reports in the Western press about a change in Moscow’s policy (as
                            reflected in the <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> visit
                            communique) were greatly exaggerated. All explain away the language of
                            the Soviet-Turkish communique as representing the lowest common
                            denominator of agreement on this complicated issue.</p>
                        <p>6. In any case, as has been previously reported, the Greeks asked for and
                            received private Soviet reassurance that Soviet policy had not changed,
                            and the Soviet press began to apply a corrective rudder to Western press
                            speculation by openly criticizing the situation in the Turkish community
                            of Cyprus and by plumping for Moscow’s perennial idea of an
                            international conference on Cyprus (for example, V. Drobkov’s article in
                            July 7 weekly <hi rend="italic">Novoye Vremya</hi>).</p>

                            Greek-Cypriot desk officer Pushkin refused to speculate about Moscow’s

                            endorsement of such an international conference, but he freely admitted
                            that the Cyprus question would be one of the primary topics for
                            discussion during the visit. Of course, our Turkish colleague <persName
                                corresp="#p_BM_3">Bilhan</persName> saw the worst in this regard,
                            ominously noting Cyprus President <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName>’s support for the conference and his current
                            “private” visit to Greece as indicators of softness in the Greek
                            position. Our Greek colleague, Botzaris, did emphasize what he felt to
                            be the new, and implicitly anti-Turkish, development represented by

                                >UN</gloss> resolutions on Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>8. Comment: Moscow is obviously concerned at the implications of a
                            substantial improvement in <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Turkish
                            relations and may be irritated at any indication that <persName

                            primarily as an attempt to pressure the Americans. The stage is set for
                            an improvement in Soviet-Greek relations which, no matter how innocent,
                            can be expected to worry the Turks. And there are continued rumors here
                            of a <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> visit (Pushkin
                            would only deny that a July visit had been scheduled, note that

                            suspect that what we will see is a continuation of Moscow’s present
                            pattern of slight zig zags—first toward Greece, then toward Turkey—which
                            in the end will produce the same even-handed policy line that we have

                        <p>The US decision to lift the arms embargo against Turkey removed an issue
                            of great symbolic importance to both Greeks and Turks. For the Greeks,
                            the embargo had been a measure of crucial US support against their
                            stronger Turkish adversary. For the Turks, it had been yet another
                            manifestation of the West’s view of them as second class members of the
                            Western community. But removal of the embargo does not get to the core
                            of the problem. As long as Greek-Turkish differences persist, their
                            conflicting demands and expectations will cause problems in their
                            relations with both <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> and the
                                <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss>. Indeed, the West’s relations
                            with Turkey may become more strained than those with Greece.</p>

                        <p>Prior to the decision to lift the embargo, the Turks hinted that if
                            Turkey’s defense and economic needs were not met by its allies, or if
                            the allies tilted toward the Greeks, Turkish foreign policy might shift
                            away from the West and closer toward the Communist and Third World
                            states. Turkish Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                >Ecevit</persName> went part way in implementing this “new look” in
                            Turkish foreign policy by courting the Soviet Union and making his “own
                            contribution to detente.”</p>
                        <p>The West’s positive response last spring to Turkey’s grave economic
                            crisis, together with the imminent lifting of the arms embargo, has
                            loosened but not eliminated the Turks’ need and desire to reduce their
                            ties to the West. Some elements of strain are likely to persist as
                                <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> gropes to solve
                            Turkey’s many domestic and foreign policy problems in a way that fits
                            his own ideological framework, domestic political constraints, and a
                            challenging international environment.</p>
                        <p>All indications are, for example, that Turkey will continue to have
                            formidable defense and economic needs that the West may be unable or
                            unwilling to underwrite, particularly if the Turks remain unwilling to
                            live within their means. <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>,
                            moreover, seems inclined to pursue his opening to Moscow, which has
                            already resulted in the possibility of substantial economic benefits he
                            may not wish to jeopardize. The government might also be tempted to look
                            for foreign scapegoats in the West for the country’s economic plight and
                            its domestic political violence. Tackling those problems may leave it
                            little domestic political capital to deal with the quarrels with the
                            Greeks that caused the rift with Turkey’s allies in the first place.</p>

                                >Karamanlis</persName> government seems to be to hope for the best
                            with respect to Turkish behavior and US assurances, and to proceed with
                            its effort to secure <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> membership and
                            reintegration into <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>. Within the
                            Alliance, Greece expects its allies to facilitate its return in the face
                            of Turkish obstructionism. On Cyprus and the Aegean, the Greeks say that
                            it is now incumbent upon the US and the West Europeans to fulfill their
                            assurances that the Turks would be more flexible once the embargo was
                            lifted. The <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName>
                            government, however, has associated itself so closely with the West that
                            it has more of a vested political interest in playing down differences.
                            In this respect, it differs from its Turkish counterpart, which has made
                            a domestic political virtue of standing up to the West and courting the
                            Soviets.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Relations With the US</p>
                        <p>That Turkey’s relations with the West—and particularly the US—may now be
                            more difficult than those of Greece was underscored recently when
                                <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> felt compelled in both
                            private and public statements to link the reactivation of US bases in
                            Turkey to the provision of additional US assistance. A message to that
                            effect was conveyed to the US by visiting senior Turkish officials and
                            in a pointed speech by <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>
                            that reiterated two themes: that Turkey’s relations with the West must
                            be broadened to include greater economic as well as defense cooperation,
                            and that such defense cooperation must not impair the atmosphere of
                            trust and detente developing between Turkey and the Soviet <pb n="103"
                                facs="0136" xml:id="pg_103"/>Union. The trigger for these comments
                            was the reluctance of the US, the International Monetary Fund, and
                            private lending institutions to give further help to the Turks until
                            Ankara takes additional austerity measures and fully implements those
                            already agreed upon.</p>
                        <p>The Greeks by contrast, have made no effort to retaliate for the lifting
                            of the embargo, for example, by restricting operations at US bases. No
                            such move seems likely, for they can less easily afford to irritate the
                            US. Moreover, because the Greek economy has generally been prosperous
                            and because Greece has an excellent international credit rating, Greek
                            relations with the US and Western Europe will be devoid of the ill
                            feelings and tensions stemming from Turkey’s debtor status. So long as
                            the present ratio of US military assistance to Greece and Turkey is
                            maintained and the military friction with Turkey that would make the
                            Greeks more demanding is absent, Greek relations with the US are apt to
                            remain on an even keel. Indeed, the <persName corresp="#p_KK_1"
                                >Karamanlis</persName> government has shown some receptivity to
                            improving and expanding those relations and has welcomed prospective
                            visits by senior US officials toward that end.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>’s linkage between defense

                                >NATO</gloss>. He has pointed to Article 2 of the North Atlantic

                            stability of member states. In the absence of more assistance from their
                            allies, the Turks have already refused to commit themselves to the
                            Alliance’s long term defense program agreed to at the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> summit in Washington last May.
                                <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> also seems intent on
                            pursuing his idea of Turkish coproduction of <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss> arms. He sees this as providing substantial economic
                            and military benefits for Turkey, but the allies see it as difficult and
                            possibly impractical given Turkey’s present low level of industrial and
                            technological development.</p>
                        <p>Friction between the Greeks and <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> is
                            not at an end, of course. But ever since the Greek decision earlier this
                            year to seek full reintegration, it is the Turks who seem more
                            troublesome in the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> context
                            because of their resistance to proposals worked out between the Greeks
                            and the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> military structure. The
                            Turks objected to proposed interim arrangements whereby, with minor
                            modifications, the Greeks would resume their status quo ante command
                            responsibility in the Aegean as well as control of Aegean airspace which
                            they had before 1974. The Turks refuse to accept the argument that such
                            arrangements would not prejudice the solution of the bilateral dispute
                            over the Aegean.</p>

                        <p>In the area of relations with the European Community too, much of the
                            strain in Greek- <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> relations is
                            diminishing while that between <pb n="104" facs="0137" xml:id="pg_104"
                            />Turkey and the <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> seems likely to
                            increase. Most of the friction between the Community and Greece was
                            related to the degree of Community commitment to Greek membership and to
                            the timing of the accession process. Those issues have been resolved to
                            the satisfaction of both sides, with all members committed to Greek
                            entry by 1981. To be sure, some friction still exists on the terms of
                            Greek entry; this is likely to increase when crucial issues such as
                            agriculture, free movement of workers, and the length of the transition
                            period are dealt with. But the unstated Greek desire for membership at
                            almost any price and the Community’s sympathy for <persName
                                corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName> make it unlikely these
                            negotiations would go off the rails.</p>
                        <p>The Turks, on the other hand, have become increasingly disappointed with
                            the poor returns from their associate member status. They initially were
                            hoping for preferential access to a major export market, large credits,
                            and a permanent source of employment for Turkish workers. In fact, a
                            negative trade balance has developed, worker migration has been curbed,
                            and in Turkish eyes, <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> financial
                            assistance has been inadequate. The Turks, moreover, resent the
                            Community’s Mediterranean policy and its agreements with third countries
                            that have watered down the meaning of Turkey’s associate status. They
                            have also been upset by the warm response to Greece’s application, which
                            in their view has raised the spectre of Turkish isolation from Western
                            Europe and a pro-Greek tilt by the Community in the Aegean and Cyprus
                            disputes.</p>
                        <p>The <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> government reacted to
                            these concerns by declaring early in its term that it would seek a
                            revision of Turkey’s associate status—already revised once before in
                            Turkey’s favor in 1970—and that a touchstone of <gloss target="#t_EC_1"
                                >EC</gloss> impartiality vis-a-vis Greece and Turkey would be its
                            willingness to include Turkey in its political consultative process once
                            the Greeks gained admission. Indeed, the Turks subsequently emphasized
                            the consultative aspect, and the Community responded by offering to
                            include Turkey in political discussions through a three man committee of
                            present, past, and future Council presidents. The Turks have rejected
                            this procedure as inadequate, however. They now want to focus on
                            economic negotiations. The Community’s likely parsimony on economic
                            assistance, suggests that Community relations with the Turks will become
                            more troublesome.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Cyprus and the Aegean</p>
                        <p>The potential for friction is somewhat greater with the Turks than with
                            the Greeks with respect to the Cyprus and Aegean disputes. There is
                            little doubt that the decision to lift the embargo has removed one
                            important cause of Turkish immobilism, since no Turkish government has
                            wanted to be seen buckling to such overt pressure. But the embargo has
                            also served as an excuse as well as a cause for Turkey’s reluctance to
                                <pb n="105" facs="0138" xml:id="pg_105"/>show greater flexibility.
                            The Turks will still be inclined to drive a hard bargain with the Greeks
                            for strategic and emotional reasons, and also because the government is
                            pushed in this direction by domestic political considerations. And they
                            will remain suspicious and resistant in the face of any external
                            involvement in their quarrels with the Greeks.</p>
                        <p>The decision to rescind the embargo is apt to make the Greeks more
                            flexible in the longer term, but in the shorter term their policy is
                            likely to be passive and reactive. Both the Greeks and the Greek
                            Cypriots assert that their respective opening proposals on the Aegean
                            and Cyprus have gone a long way toward meeting Turkish demands and that
                            it is now up to the US and the West Europeans to press Turkey to
                            reciprocate. In the meantime, the Greeks will be content to focus their
                            attention on the <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> negotiations while making sure that
                            the Greek Cypriots do not backtrack on the proposals they have already
                            tabled.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Soviet Option</p>
                        <p>Although the relations of both countries with Moscow have been improving,
                            the Greeks have less reason and desire to enhance their Soviet ties. The
                                <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> government, on the
                            other hand, seems inclined to continue using the Soviet card both as an
                            end in itself and as a means of securing badly needed military and
                            economic assistance from its allies.</p>
                        <p>In Greece, disenchantment with the West has not fostered any sentiment
                            among Greek leaders or in most of the electorate to court Moscow; this
                            remains true even after the decision to rescind the embargo. The staunch
                            anti-communism of the Greek political, military, and economic elite and
                            Moscow’s wooing of the Turks accounts for this, as does the absence of
                            any great need for Soviet economic assistance. Although there will be a
                            thaw when Greek Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_RG_1"

                            before too long, the relationship is not likely to change
                            substantially.</p>
                        <p>In Turkey, by contrast, <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>
                            seems to be continuing his effort to secure public and military
                            acceptance of detente with the Soviet Union, which he considers
                            desirable both to increase Turkey’s maneuverability and security, and to
                            guarantee delivery of the substantial economic assistance promised him
                            during his Moscow visit last June. This apparently included a three-fold
                            increase in trade between the two countries and substantial quantities
                            of oil. Whether <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> intends to

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Conclusion</p>
                        <p>Overall, then, US and West European relations with Greece and Turkey are
                            likely to remain troubled so long as the bilateral differences between
                            the two countries are unresolved and each tries to mobilize Western
                            support against the other and in behalf of broader national goals. The
                            embargo in this respect was merely one element of a complicated
                            equation. Its lifting is likely to produce neither Turkish intransigence
                            and adventurousness, as opponents of its rescinding had feared, nor
                            significant Turkish flexibility, as some on the other side had hoped.
                            Instead, both Greeks and Turks are likely to continue jockeying for
                            advantage, and progress in resolving their disputes is apt to be slow as
                            they weigh strategic, emotional, and domestic political considerations
                            against the desirability of compromise and improving the cohesiveness of
                            the Western defense and economic systems.</p>
                        <p>Lifting of the embargo is not likely by itself to cause irreparable
                            damage to relations with the Greeks or a complete rapprochement with
                            Turkey. Greece has too many historical, cultural, economic and security
                            bonds with the West for that to happen, and the <persName
                                corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName> government has no other
                            viable option in any event. Greece’s relations with the US and Western
                            Europe would worsen markedly only if the latter began to show some
                            hesitancy about supporting Greek membership in the European Community
                            and reintegration into <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>, or in the
                            event of a Turkish resort to military pressure to which the West
                            responded with indifference.</p>
                        <p>The Turks also have a strong commitment to the West. But the combination
                            of the greater economic needs, their strategic importance, and <persName

                            Turkish foreign policy is likely to continue to produce substantially
                            more friction between Turkey and the West, the more so at this juncture
                            when Turkey feels the West is not being adequately sensitive to Turkey’s
                            economic woes and is pursuing policies toward the Greeks in the <gloss

                            result is that Turkey will continue to follow a foreign policy that will
                            be somewhat similar to the French and Romanian models in <gloss

                            grounding itself within the Western camp but pursuing independent

                        <p>The Administration’s Cyprus policy has severely damaged the President’s

                                was crucial to his successful run for the White House.</note> For
                            the first time in history, the Greek-American vote is something other
                            than one of the small ethnic groups whose support it would be nice to
                            have.</p>
                        <p>A survey of top Greek-American political observers estimates that if the

                                >Carter</persName> would receive approximately thirty percent of the
                            Greek-American vote. That compares with approximately eighty percent he
                            received in 1976. This defection may not be immediately perceptible but
                            is quite real.</p>
                        <p>The group’s perception of betrayal accelerates the Greek-American’s

                            tend to be conservative.</p>

                            our party and is willing to encourage Presidential support if they can
                            do so without losing their credibility with the Greek-American
                            community. We also have greater policy flexibility than did <persName

                            Our consciously adopted tactic has been to leave Cyprus up to the <gloss

                        <p>The Greek lobby in this country puts all the blame on the Turks and
                            argues that Turkey’s need for more economic aid should be exploited to
                            pressure her into a Cyprus settlement. (A crude attempt on our part to
                            do this would probably only result in pushing <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> into an anti-American corner or
                            causing him to fall.) Privately, we should continue to appeal to
                                <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> to help us with
                            Congress by at least demonstrating some political cleverness in making
                            offers that put the Greeks on the defensive or force them to make some
                            counter-offers. (C)</p>
                        <p>Greek Cyprus continues to enjoy an unprecedented economic boom—so there
                            is not much incentive there to risk anything for a settlement. Turkish
                            Cyprus, on the other hand, is still economically depressed and
                            represents a net burden on the Turkish economy. (U)</p>
                        <p>We should not get ourselves into the middle of the Cyprus situation at
                            this late stage, having avoided it for so long, much as both <pb n="109"
                                facs="0142" xml:id="pg_109"/>Greeks and Turks would welcome the
                            drama of a Camp David type of involvement by the President (I had two

                            rejected them). But we might, as a tactic and as a way of trying
                            something different from the lackadaisical <gloss target="#t_UN_1"

                        <p>There has been <hi rend="italic">slight progress on other issues between

                            reconciliation. Aegean talks have resulted in slight progress on air and
                            seabed issues. Delineation of military boundaries and the <gloss

                            recently. <hi rend="italic">On these issues we have a right to expect

                            increases in aid would be most likely to produce results. (C)</p>
                        <p>We will be making the same mistake the Administration made last year and
                            the year before if we let our approach in Congress to Turkish problems
                            be taken primarily in the framework of the complaints and political
                            machinations of the Greek lobby. We need to take the initiative with
                            responsible, national-security-minded senators and congressmen to brief

                        </p>
                        <p>Looking to 1980 and anticipated pressure on the Administration by the
                            Greek American community, I offer the following thoughts:</p>
                        <p>—A US initiative on Cyprus does not hold out much promise given the fact
                            that of the six players (including <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1"
                                >Waldheim</persName> and ourselves) we would be the only player
                            pressing for an early just-compromise settlement—which all others would
                            probably interpret as expected election year activity.</p>
                        <p>—We stand the best chance, while difficult, of furthering our US foreign
                            policy objectives (of interest to Greek Americans) if we concentrate on
                            US-Greek relations and on working to achieve Greek reintegration in
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>—an objective of very real
                            importance to <persName corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName> in terms
                            of his accomplishments as Prime Minister (assuming he decides to step up
                            to the office of President this spring).</p>
                        <p>Bernie Rodgers, wearing his international hat, is taking great care to
                            work independently of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> However,
                            I understand he will be briefing Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1"
                                >Vance</persName> during <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1"

                        </p>
                        <p>—To keep the Cyprus front under control, I believe it might be useful if
                            the President were to invite <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1"
                                >Waldheim</persName> to Washington early in 1980 to review the

                            OUTLOOK</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>One of the Soviet Union’s major foreign policy interests in the recent
                            Brezhnev era has been to develop its relations with Turkey and Greece in
                            response to strategic concerns in the eastern Mediterranean and the
                            Middle East. The campaign reached a zenith of sorts in 1978–79 with a
                            series of high-level visits, the signing of political documents
                            establishing a framework for expansion of ties, and agreements to
                            develop trade and economic cooperation. The Kremlin’s desire to
                            neutralize <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> and to reduce US
                            military options in the region dictates a continuing Soviet stake in
                            viable relations with Athens and Ankara.</p>
                        <p>Greece’s relative economic and political stability and its government’s
                            desire to normalize relations with the East, even while retaining a
                            strong anti-Communist bias at home, augur development of relations more
                            or less along the lines of those between the Soviet Union and most West
                            European countries.</p>
                        <p>Turkey promises to be an unpredictable, even volatile, equation for
                            Moscow. Growing economic and political difficulties in Turkey may lead
                            to a more conservative order or other conditions that could erase some
                            of the gains the Soviets have achieved.</p>
                        <p>The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan already has begun to renovate Turkey’s
                            ties with the West at the expense of those with the Soviet Union, as
                            members of the Western alliance respond to events by increasing the flow
                            of economic and military aid to Ankara. The strong opposition of Saudi
                            Arabia, a major potential aid donor, and other influential non-aligned
                            powers to the Afghanistan invasion may also deter the Turks from
                            expanding their Soviet ties.</p>
                        <p>Kurdish separatism in Iran, if successful, will raise the possibility of
                            similar actions among Turkey’s Kurdish minority. The Turks will be
                            sensitive to any Soviet attempt to sponsor the Kurds in Turkey or
                            Iran.</p>

                        <p>Significant Turkish rapprochement with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                                >USSR</gloss> and its allies in the 1980’s is unlikely, even under a
                            left-of-center government in Ankara. Militating against it are a
                            multitude of influences—historic Turkish opposition to Russia, the
                            anti-Communist bias of a basically conservative Muslim population, the
                            inability of <gloss target="#t_CEMA_1">CEMA</gloss> member-countries to
                            match the economic advantages offered by the West, the example of
                            Afghanistan. On the other hand, economic, security, and pragmatic
                            political considerations will compel even a conservative government to
                            try to maintain good relations with the Soviets.</p>

                                sentiment, and the United States should not publicly criticize the
                                takeover. (Carter Library, National Security Affairs, Brzezinski
                                Material, Country File, Box 75, Turkey: 9/80–1/81)</note> These
                            should be our priorities too—for it is only by accomplishment of these
                            objectives that Turkey can be secured as a valuable ally and effective
                            member of <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> and rebuilt as a
                            bastion of strength in the Middle East.</p>
                        <p>The Turkish military leadership is nevertheless likely to recognize the
                            advantages of making as much progress as possible on Greek relations and
                            Cyprus. We need to deal with them quietly on these issues and we need to
                            restrain the Greeks and Cypriots (if they are so inclined) from making
                            embarrassing noise about them. We also need to restrain (if we can)
                            Greek-American congressmen and other Greek Lobby spokesmen from making
                            critical, intemperate comments about these problems or from seeming to
                            make taunting challenges about settling them. The old Greek Lobby has
                            been remarkably quiet during this campaign season and is being
                            encouraged in no way by the present Greek Ambassador here, who probably
                            sees Turkish developments very much along the lines I have outlined in
                            this memorandum. There is no way in which anyone can benefit by making
                            Turkey a campaign issue in any way. All tendencies to do so should be
                            avoided.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_CG_2">Clerides</persName> said he was still
                            optimistic that a negotiated Cyprus settlement could eventually be
                            reached. He agreed that the next four months presented opportunities to
                            get the negotiating process restarted and urged that this chance not be
                            lost. He endorsed the idea of sending a US envoy to the area, as the
                            first step in developing US proposals which, following coordination and
                            support by the <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss>–9, could be inserted
                            into the negotiating process. <persName corresp="#p_CG_2"
                                >Clerides</persName> felt that only with this kind of external
                            stimulus could negotiations be kept from bogging down in the kind of
                            procedural disagreements that have prevented meaningful talks from
                            taking place since February 1976. Secretary-designate <persName
                                corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> explained that we had reached no
                            specific conclusion as to how to proceed, but we were looking for ways
                            to be helpful in facilitating movement toward a Cyprus settlement.</p>

                                >Clerides</persName> to describe the current situation on the
                            island.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_CG_2">Clerides</persName> said he was anxious
                            about the atmosphere. A climate of optimism had been created by the
                            American elections, and everyone on the island now expected some
                            movement in the next few weeks or months. It was important that this
                            optimism not be totally disappointed by a further indefinite
                            stalemate.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CG_2">Clerides</persName> recalled the strong
                            anti-US feeling that had gripped the island in 1974. This feeling had
                            now begun to disappear, but it could return at any time. The United
                            States must be careful not to create the impression that it can bring
                            about a solution by waving a magic wand, yet there should be no inertia
                            either. There is a growing feeling, which Archbishop <persName
                                corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName> shares, that either progress
                            will be registered in the next few months or Cyprus will enter a long
                            period of stagnation. <persName corresp="#p_CG_2">Clerides</persName>
                            explained that he did not completely share the Archbishop’s view on this
                            point, but he, too, believed that the next few months were important and
                            that the opportunities they presented should not be lost.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> agreed that the
                            over-optimism on the island was potentially dangerous and could lead to
                            disillusionment. Miracles were not possible. Nonetheless, the US had a
                            strong interest in seeing that progress toward a solution begins to be
                            made. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> then asked Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CG_2">Clerides</persName>’ opinion as to
                            whether it might be useful to send an envoy to the area to assess the
                            situation on the ground, and make an evaluation of what might be done by
                            the new Administration.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CG_2">Clerides</persName> thought this an
                            excellent idea. His only reservation was that the envoy not go out to
                            learn the views of the parties in an unstructured way. If this were
                            done, the parties would tell him only what they had told others, and
                            nothing would have been gained. There have been countless study missions
                            and general reports on Cyprus already. What had to be made clear to the
                            parties before the envoy traveled was that the envoy wanted to know in
                            concrete terms the precise limits of each side’s position. In this way,
                            the envoy could come back with some rough idea of the margins, within
                            which solutions on individual points were possible.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> explained that he had
                            reached no specific conclusions as yet as to how to proceed, but that we
                            were looking for ways in which we might be helpful in laying a
                            foundation for facilitating movement toward a Cyprus solution. In this
                            connection, he asked for <persName corresp="#p_CG_2"
                            >Clerides</persName>’ views as to whether the US should proceed alone,
                            ask the Europeans to do something separately, or consider some form of
                            US-European initiative.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CG_2">Clerides</persName> said he favored a joint
                            venture involving the US and the EC–9 powers. He was not sure how this
                            would work in practice, but suggested that after the US envoy visited
                            the area, and developed a plan of action, consultation should begin with
                            the Europeans to insure that the US plans had the full support and
                            approval of the <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss>–9.</p>

                                >EC</gloss>–9 cooperation had occurred in 1976 in connection with

                            whether this had been a productive exercise and whether that document
                            had contained anything useful from a Cypriot standpoint. Would something
                            along the lines of this paper still be helpful?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CG_2">Clerides</persName> said that the five
                            principles had some usefulness but had been looked upon with great
                            mistrust in Cyprus because they were viewed as a product of an
                            unfriendly Administration. This kind of a document might be of some help
                            if the points in it were expanded and reformulated.</p>
                        <p>This exchange led to a more general discussion of what might constitute a
                            just settlement from a Cypriot standpoint. <persName corresp="#p_CG_2"
                                >Clerides</persName> said the only feasible—even if not entirely
                            just—settlement will almost certainly involve a bizonal federation. At
                            the same time the current Turkish zone in the north had to be reduced.
                            Percentage figures themselves were not as important as the question of
                            how many refugees could return to the areas the Turks vacated. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CG_2">Clerides</persName> noted, for example, that while
                            New Famagusta and its environs represented less than 1% of Cyprus, the
                            area could absorb as many as 40,000 Greek Cypriots. There were also
                            other areas in the north with high absorptive capacity.</p>
                        <p>As for a future central Government, <persName corresp="#p_CG_2"
                                >Clerides</persName> said there would have to be meaningful
                            participation by both communities without absolute numerical equality.
                            In the 1960 constitution the Turks were given veto powers on foreign
                            policy, defense and internal security questions. These vetoes made the
                            system unworkable. What was required now was Turkish equality in the
                            formulation and not the execution of policy. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> agreed that it should be
                            possible to devise a constitutional system that would make this
                            possible. <persName corresp="#p_CG_2">Clerides</persName> recalled in
                            this connection that when the subject of immigration had been discussed
                            orally at one point last year, <persName corresp="#p_DR_1"
                                >Denktash</persName> had said there could be a joint immigration
                            board composed of Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots who would pass on
                            applications. <persName corresp="#p_CG_2">Clerides</persName> felt a
                            similar system might be devised for the management of ports and airports
                            as well. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HAA_1">Hartman</persName> noted that
                            as far back as 1974, former Turkish Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> had spoken along parallel
                            lines.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CG_2">Clerides</persName> observed, however, that
                            two basic difficulties remained in the constitutional area. The Greeks
                            wanted to preserve a federation, whereas the Turks wanted to create a
                            confederation. While the difference was in part semantic, it was evident
                            that the Turks wanted the Central Government to have as little power as
                            possible, whereas the <pb n="118" facs="0151" xml:id="pg_118"/>Greek
                            Cypriots wanted the opposite. The second area concerned whether the
                            religious leaders could hold positions in government. If the Turks
                            insisted on writing into a new constitution that Cyprus can only be a
                            lay state, there will be no settlement. <persName corresp="#p_M3_1"
                                >Makarios</persName> may some day of his own accord resign, but he
                            will never sign any agreement which prevents the church and those
                            occupying places in it, from playing a direct role in state affairs.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName>. Was he free to take
                            positions on his own, or was he under the firm control of Ankara?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CG_2">Clerides</persName> answered that at the
                            start of the negotiations two years ago, he had the impression that
                                <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName>’s hands were firmly
                            tied by Ankara. As the talks went on, however, it became evident that
                                <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> had considerable
                            freedom on some issues. On occasion he proved even more difficult than
                            the Turkish Government. This much was clear: <persName corresp="#p_DR_1"
                                >Denktash</persName> was unable to undertake any initiative without

                                >Denktash</persName> clearly could not be forced to do something by

                            <persName corresp="#p_CG_2">Clerides</persName> said the economic
                            situation in the north was most unfavorable. The Turkish Cypriots had
                            been unable to organize anything properly. There was substantial
                            unemployment, and the standard of living had declined markedly since
                            1974. Still, there was uncertainty in <persName corresp="#p_CG_2"
                                >Clerides</persName>’ mind as to what political effect this would
                            have. The economic situation might serve as pressure on <persName
                                corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> to reach an accommodation with
                            the Greek Cypriots, but it was also possible it might move him in the
                            direction of issuing a unilateral declaration of independence.</p>
                        <p>As for Turkish colonization of the north, <persName corresp="#p_CG_2"
                                >Clerides</persName> said Greek Cypriot estimates were that some
                            30,000 Turks had been brought to the island thus far. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HAA_1">Hartman</persName> noted that we were not sure
                            whether these Turks were permanent settlers or were being rotated into
                            and out of Cyprus as temporary workers.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CG_2">Clerides</persName> explained that an
                            even more serious problem was the expulsion of Greeks from the north.
                            These expulsions were proceeding daily, despite promises made by
                                <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> to the <gloss

                            <persName corresp="#p_CG_2">Clerides</persName> conceded that Turkish
                            pressure was only one of many reasons the Greek Cypriots in the north
                            lived under extremely difficult conditions. Schools were inadequate and
                            once families send children south to school, they cannot return, even
                            for holidays. There are no doctors left in the villages, and hospital
                            care throughout the north is very poor. Moreover, when one or more <pb

                            the south, Turks are immediately placed in their houses, thus creating a
                            kind of psychological pressure for the remaining Greek Cypriots to begin
                            thinking of leaving also. There was also, <persName corresp="#p_CG_2"
                                >Clerides</persName> noted with satisfaction, a vibrant economic
                            situation in the south which clearly attracted Greek Cypriots. The
                            southern economy had bounced back in an amazing way, so that the per
                            capita income of Greek Cypriots in the south today equals the per capita
                            income of all Cypriots in 1974.</p>

                            was imperative that whatever proposals were made and solutions reached,

                            excellent diplomat but was somewhat over-cautious and conservative, and,

                                was to keep the island an independent, bi-communal, and non-aligned

                                between the federated areas would take into account their economic
                                viability and land ownership. 3. Questions of freedom of movement
                                and settlement are left to further discussion. 4. A central
                                government would be established with the task of safeguarding the
                                unity of Cyprus on the basis of its bicommunal nature.” (Borowiec,

                            suggested to the Archbishop that a second possibility would be to have

                                >Clerides</persName> said it was his impression that both of these

                            <persName corresp="#p_CG_2">Clerides</persName> thought the <persName
                                corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> letter, which he said he had
                            not read, had not suggested a substantive discussion of the Cyprus
                            problem, but only the establishment of “links” between the two sides.
                            When it was pointed out to <persName corresp="#p_CG_2"
                                >Clerides</persName> that the letter again referred to the
                            possibility of setting up a transitional regime to carry the two
                            communities through the period of negotiation, <persName
                                corresp="#p_CG_2">Clerides</persName> responded that if that was the
                            case, there would be only one meeting, for Archbishop <persName
                                corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName> would have nothing to do with
                            this idea. <persName corresp="#p_HAA_1">Hartman</persName> observed that
                            the <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> letter provided a
                            basis for a meeting, and that the opportunity should not be lost.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_CG_2">Clerides</persName> agreed, noting that the
                            last substantive discussion of the Cyprus problem had occurred almost
                            one year ago, in February 1976.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> recalled that when he
                            had spoken to the current Greek-Cypriot intercommunal negotiator in New
                            York some six weeks ago, the negotiator had explained that the two sides
                            were bogged down continuously with procedural disagreements.<note n="6"
                                xml:id="d31fn6">No record of this meeting was found.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CG_2">Clerides</persName> said the problem was the
                            Greek Cypriots wanted to discuss territorial issues first to see what
                            they might get back, but the Turks would only talk about territory at
                            the end of the negotiations, when the Greeks had confirmed their
                            acceptance of a bizonal federation with a weak central government.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> suggested that a way
                            could be found around these kinds of procedural hurdles. The US did not
                            underestimate the difficulty of doing so, but felt that some new effort
                            to facilitate the negotiating process should be attempted.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CG_2">Clerides</persName> observed that so long
                            as matters are left to the two sides, it was almost certain that
                            procedural difficulties would develop. It was essential that concrete
                            proposals be formulated by outsiders, and given to the parties as a
                            basis for discussion. In order to make proposals which are realistic,
                            however, it is imperative that the outsiders have a clear idea of what

                            for expressing his views so concisely and clearly. The two agreed to say

                            but would give the Archbishop no details of what was actually discussed.
                            It was agreed that in response to enquiries, both sides would say merely
                            that there had been an informal exchange of views between friends of

                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName> began the
                            conversation by welcoming <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1"
                                >Clifford</persName> to Cyprus as the special envoy of President
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>. He said the people
                            of Cyprus were pleased with the keen interest the new Administration had
                            shown in the problems of the island, and its expression of willingness
                            to work for a settlement. The US could play a decisive role, and the
                            President said he was pleased the <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                >Carter</persName> Administration was prepared to help the parties
                            move toward a solution. The President said he deeply appreciated this US
                            interest and willingness to be involved.</p>
                        <pb n="122" facs="0155" xml:id="pg_122"/>
                        <p>He then recounted the history of the intercommunal discussions.<note

                                    7</ref>.</note> These, he said, had produced no results. The
                            current Cyprus situation is deadlocked. The President described his
                            recent meeting with <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName>,
                            which he called a mild breakthrough.<note n="3" xml:id="d32fn3">See <ref
                                    target="#d31fn5">footnote 5, Document 31</ref>.</note> He said
                            his two meetings represented an effort to find common ground through
                            which negotiations could proceed. Some common ground had indeed been
                            found, though not enough to justify great optimism.</p>
                        <p>Turkish motives for resuming the dialogue had been the subject of great
                            speculation in Cyprus. Some said it represented a desire by Turkey to
                            improve its image in the international community. Some said it
                            represented a Turkish desire to have the US Congress move to ratify the
                            Defense Cooperation Agreement. <persName corresp="#p_M3_1"
                                >Makarios</persName> himself declined to speculate on the Turkish
                            motive, but said that irrespective of what had moved the Turks, the
                            meetings themselves were a positive step. Movement had occurred in the
                            right direction.</p>
                        <p>The President was doubtful, however, about the prospects for the March 31
                            meeting in Vienna. He wondered whether the Turks would be willing to
                            make meaningful concessions before the Turkish elections. Despite such
                            reservations, he said he and his government were prepared to go forward
                            with good will.</p>
                        <p>He then described at some length the issues involved in movement toward a
                            Cyprus settlement. The territorial question was the key to the solution.
                            The principles of freedom of settlement, freedom of movement and freedom
                            of property were also vital. With respect to the powers and functions of
                            a future central government, <persName corresp="#p_M3_1"
                                >Makarios</persName> insisted that these must safeguard the unity of
                            the state as well as have regard for the bicommunal character of
                            Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>The criteria for the territorial solution were land ownership,
                            productivity and economic viability. The territorial settlement also had
                            to take account of the population ratio. Official records of land
                            ownership maintained by the British before independence and those of the
                            Cyprus Government developed after independence showed that the Turks
                            owned somewhere between 18 and 20 percent of the land. This was close to
                            the percentage of Turks on the island.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName> recalled that
                            he had proposed a Turkish zone of 20%, and <persName corresp="#p_DR_1"
                                >Denktash</persName> had countered with a proposal for 32.8%. The
                            Turkish figure could not be justified and <persName corresp="#p_M3_1"
                                >Makarios</persName> noted that a great gap existed between the
                            Greek-Cypriot and Turkish-Cypriot figures.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName> noted that his
                            Government had accepted the concept of a bicommunal federation. This was
                            the first time in history a <pb n="123" facs="0156" xml:id="pg_123"
                            />unitary state would be reconstructed to become a federal state. But
                            federation could not be disguised as confederation. Nor could it be a
                            prelude to partition. Cyprus was a small country which had been
                            economically integrated and homogenized. It had to have a governmental
                            structure that would ensure cohesion and economic unity. It would also
                            have to prevent the further separation of people. No solution could
                            deviate from basic human rights principles. These same principles had
                            been stressed by President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                >Carter</persName> who had proven that he was a man of action and
                            not mere words. His recent acts in the human rights field had led to
                            great feelings of confidence in Cyprus and it was in this spirit that
                            the Cypriot people welcomed US initiatives to find a peaceful solution
                            to the Cyprus problem.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> thanked
                            President <persName corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName> for his
                            gracious welcome and said that he would like to discuss his own feelings
                            about President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> in some
                            detail. He had found the President a man of unusual intelligence, with a
                            real capability for leadership, and this suggested that he would have a
                            successful and productive presidency.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> recalled the long
                            relationship between the United States and Cyprus and especially between
                            the leaders of the United States and His Beatitude, President <persName
                                corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName>. He praised President
                                <persName corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName> for his leadership
                            and past courage, noting that despite many difficulties, he continued to
                            provide firm and meaningful leadership for his country. This provided a
                            basis of confidence to the Cypriot people, and hope for a Cyprus
                            solution.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> asserted that President
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> believes that 1977 is
                            the year of decision for Cyprus. At the very start of his term as
                            President, he had selected <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1"
                                >Clifford</persName> to head a mission to the Eastern Mediterranean.
                            This mission aimed at ascertaining the facts, gaining the impressions of
                            the leaders in the various countries, the difficulties and problems that
                            existed, together with recommendations for positive solutions. The
                            President looked forward to receiving a report from the <persName
                                corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> mission with suggestions as
                            to how the United States might utilize its good offices in efforts to
                            solve the problems that existed in the area. Once the <persName
                                corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> mission returns to
                            Washington, it will prepare a report which the President and his senior
                            advisers will consider, and following their discussions they will reach
                            an agreement on future policy. This in turn will be discussed with
                            Congress, so that if at all possible, jointly agreed policies will be
                            adopted.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> recalled that during
                            the past eight years, the United States had a divided government in

                            and how the United States might be of real assistance. <persName

                            for this position, and had suggested that we contact him at any time we
                            had proposals we considered of value. In sum, we conveyed to him our

                        <p>The United States believes a Cyprus solution is vitally needed. The
                            present situation is unsatisfactory and potentially volatile. No
                            situation remains static, and the situation could well change in ways
                            which would be disadvantageous to the Cypriot people. Therefore, we felt
                            there was pressure on all the parties and the friends of Cyprus to find
                            a solution as quickly as possible.</p>

                            had spent three days in Greece, had established a warm, personal
                            relationship with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_CC_1"
                                >Caramanlis</persName> and had conveyed the notion that we wished to
                            be helpful in solving problems in the Eastern Mediterranean. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> said that he had told
                                <persName corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName> that his mission
                            would not end with this visit, and that he expected President <persName

                            once US policies in the Eastern Mediterranean had been established and
                            some need arose to be directly helpful to the parties.</p>

                            had gone to Turkey. <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName>
                            said he had never visited Ankara before. He had sought, in his three
                            days in the Turkish capital, to develop a personal relationship with the
                            Turkish leadership, and he believed he had succeeded. He had spent
                            several hours alone with Prime Minister Demirel. An equally long talk
                            had been arranged with opposition leader, Bulent <persName

                            the problems in the area, and now realized that Greece, Turkey and
                            Cyprus all dealt with a set of problems exacerbated by years of mistakes
                            and misunderstandings. This did not make the problems insurmountable.
                            Indeed, countries <pb n="125" facs="0158" xml:id="pg_125"/>which had
                            experienced deep distrust, such as France and Germany, had been able

                            represented the climax of his visit. He noted that he had already met
                            with some of the President’s associates and that on Friday he intended
                            to call on <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Rauf Denktash</persName> and get

                                >Clifford</persName> said he had now reached certain conclusions of
                            his own about the situation in the Eastern Mediterranean. He intended to
                            pass on these personal conclusions to President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> on his return to Washington,
                            and therefore wished to discuss them directly with President <persName
                                corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName> later in their conversation
                            today.</p>
                        <p>The Archbishop again insisted that the United States could play a
                            decisive role in settling the Cyprus problem. Any proposal from the
                            United States would be most welcome. Indeed, without such US help,
                                <persName corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName> did not think the
                            representatives of the Greek-Cypriot and Turkish-Cypriot communities
                            could reach agreement on their own.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName> noted that the
                            next round of Vienna talks were scheduled to begin at the end of March,
                            but he questioned how long they would last and what substantive
                            developments would result. From his viewpoint it now looked like the
                            Vienna talks would be purely ceremonial in character. Rather than
                            talking about territory, the Turks will probably say they have no
                            records and are not willing to discuss detailed adjustments. They may
                            insist on returning to Nicosia quickly. <persName corresp="#p_M3_1"
                                >Makarios</persName> said it was his personal view that progress was
                            simply not possible until after the Turkish elections.<note n="6"
                                xml:id="d32fn6">Turkey held the election on June 5.</note> The
                            Turks, he said smilingly, probably want a solution, but he was not sure
                            what kind of solution. His guess was that it would be a solution not
                            substantially different from the present situation. They will probably
                            offer to return only three to five percent of the territory they now
                            hold. There could be no solution on this basis.</p>
                        <p>The first issue to be discussed in Vienna, <persName corresp="#p_M3_1"
                                >Makarios</persName> insisted, must be territory. This subject is of
                            primary importance to the Greek Cypriots. The territorial issue touched
                            on the refugee question and other problems and principles. <persName
                                corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName> said his government was ready
                            to make concessions, but the fact remained that the Turks were in a
                            position of overwhelming strength. Moreover, Greek-Cypriot compromises
                            could not be at the expense of the unity of Cyprus.</p>

                            must serve as a guide to a future <pb n="126" facs="0159"

                            crucial year for Cyprus. If the current impetus is lost, no solution
                            would be found for a long time and the present dangers would continue. A
                            solution for Cyprus would ease other problems in the area, between
                            Greece and Turkey and between both of these <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss> allies and the United States. A solution would also be

                            Alliance. Some people on the island think any involvement by <gloss

                                corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName> insisted that this was not his
                            position. He said he welcomed the assistance of the United States, and
                            that such help was badly needed. At the same time, he hoped that the
                            Congress would not approve a Defense Cooperation Agreement with Turkey
                            until significant progress was made on Cyprus of a type that would
                            ensure that a real solution is certain. Any other course would tend to
                            convince people in Cyprus that the recent <persName corresp="#p_M3_1"
                                >Makarios</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName>
                            meetings were staged by the Turks in an effort solely to convince
                            Congress to move forward with the Turkish <gloss target="#t_DCA_1"
                                >DCA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The United States has the ability to put pressure on Turkey and thus to
                            facilitate concessions in connection with Cyprus. The US embargo is a
                            practical means of doing this. The President said he realized that one
                            could not challenge Turkey directly, but that there were other ways of
                            exerting pressure. Indeed, such pressure was essential if there was to
                            be meaningful progress. Once agreement on the details of a Cyprus
                            settlement were achieved, there would be a number of other questions
                            that would arise, such as guarantees. Each of the two communities is
                            suspicious of the other and a system different from the present guaranty
                            arrangement would have to be found.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName> concluded his
                            presentation by saying that he did not know whether the United States
                            would be specific and make a direct proposal to help solve the Cyprus
                            problem. In his view, the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            Government was free to proceed in this direction. He said he was also
                            aware that the European Community was interested in being helpful.<note

                        <p>The President commented that the Secretary General appeared to have
                            achieved an outstanding success in Cyprus by bringing together <pb

                            expressed US appreciation for the help which the Secretary General had
                            given <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clark Clifford</persName> and
                            concluded that we wanted to continue to consult on events in Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary General replied that there has been a real change in
                            attitude in Cyprus. He felt that the two sides now wanted to come to
                            terms although one could not be too optimistic given the many
                            difficulties involved in final settlement. But the Greek Cypriots now
                            realize that they cannot solve their problems by resorting to the
                            General Assembly. And the Turkish Cypriots realize that military power
                            alone will not gain them the international legitimacy they require.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName>, for example, has
                            tried and failed to get the right to address the General Assembly.</p>
                        <p>The President asked to what degree <persName corresp="#p_DR_1"
                                >Denktash</persName> took orders from the Turkish Government or
                            acted on his own. The Secretary General responded that it depended on
                            the circumstances. At times, the Turks complained that <persName
                                corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> was exploiting their own
                            international political difficulties. At other times, <persName
                                corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> complained that the Turks had
                            ordered him to abandon proposals which he had sold to his own people
                            with great difficulty. In any event, the Secretary General believes that
                            after the Turkish elections in June, there is a good chance to make real
                            diplomatic progress.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked whether <persName corresp="#p_M3_1"
                                >Makarios</persName> was really prepared to accept a bi-zonal
                            solution. The Secretary General volunteered that <persName
                                corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName> was prepared, but reluctantly.
                            During the negotiations, <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName>
                            asked <persName corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName> why he was using
                            the word “bi-communal”, which he had never used before, and what it
                            meant. After considerable discussion, <persName corresp="#p_DR_1"
                                >Denktash</persName> announced that he would accept “bi-communal” as
                            long as <persName corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName> understood that
                            he, <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName>, considered that it
                            meant “bizonal.”<note n="3" xml:id="d33fn3">The distinction between
                                “bi-communal” and “bi-zonal” centered on how to reconcile <persName
                                    corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName>’ attempts to maintain
                                Cyprus as a unitary state while satisfying <persName
                                    corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName>’s condition that any
                                settlement ensured a degree of autonomy for the minority
                                Turkish-Cypriot population.</note> According to the Secretary
                            General, “<persName corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName> accepted this
                            silently.”</p>

                            Mediterranean in cautiously optimistic mood, convinced that March 31
                            intercommunal negotiations represented important opportunity for
                            progress and that Cyprus settlement could be achieved in 1977. What was
                            necessary first step was for both sides to honor commitments they had
                            made to <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName>. We were
                            beginning to receive indications that this might not occur and <persName

                            to having realistic proposals placed on table in Vienna. Greek Cypriots
                            had agreed to produce map to serve as basis for concrete territorial
                            discussions and Turks had said they would provide outline for structure
                            of future government. It was vital that both sides lived up to these
                            promises.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> went on to explain that
                            a way had to be found, preferably before both parties got to Vienna of
                            arriving at procedures whereby territorial and constitutional issues can
                            be discussed simultaneously. Greek Cypriots could not expect territorial
                            issues to be considered first and constitutional issues tackled only
                            when Greek and Turkish zones had been finally determined. Any number of
                            ways could be found to produce simultaneous discussions of territorial
                            and constitutional questions and we trust Greek Cypriots and Turkish
                            Cypriots would work with <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Special

                        <p>4. On timing, <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> said that we
                            looked forward to six or seven days of substantive discussion in Vienna
                            and hoped subsequent Easter recess would be relatively short. There
                            seemed no reason why talks could not resume and continue for several
                            additional weeks in April. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName>
                            agreed with <persName corresp="#p_DN_1">Dimitriou</persName> that Vienna

                            for sustained, serious talks but indicated our understanding of

                                >Nimetz</persName> indicated we would remain active, consulting

                            officials over the next two weeks and as the talks progress. He said we

                            avoiding any appearance of putting pressure on him; newspaper stories
                            alleging that we, or the EC–9, planned such pressure were untrue.<note

                        <p>Begin text. Your Beatitude: While I know that Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> has already expressed his
                            thanks for your cordial reception during his visit to Nicosia, I wanted
                            to write to you to add my personal appreciation for the courtesy and
                            openness with which you received my special representative and his
                            party. I would like particularly to thank you for your very kind
                            personal regards which Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1"
                                >Clifford</persName> conveyed to me.</p>
                        <p>The time you devoted to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1"
                                >Clifford</persName>, the warm personal relationship which you and
                            he developed, and the excellent hospitality which you extended greatly
                            assisted in his mission. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1"
                                >Clifford</persName> has reported to me at length on his extensive
                            discussions with you<note n="2" xml:id="d35fn2">See <ref target="#d10"
                                    >Document 10</ref>.</note> and this, in turn, has led to our
                            greater understanding of the Cyprus problem.</p>
                        <p>Your willingness to begin sustained and concrete negotiations is vitally
                            important. I was particularly grateful to learn from Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> that specific, substantive
                            proposals will be put on the table in Vienna later this month. It is the
                            sincere hope of the United States that through discussion of such
                            concrete ideas the way will be opened to real progress toward the Cyprus
                            settlement we all desire. While we continue to support fully the role of
                            United Nations Secretary General <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1"
                                >Waldheim</persName>, my administration will spare no effort to make
                            any contribution we can to assist with the Cyprus intercommunal talks.
                            It is my earnest hope that through the efforts of all interested
                            parties, 1977 will prove to be the year a just Cyprus settlement becomes
                            a reality. Sincerely, <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Jimmy

                            were made to try and find a way to resolve such conflicts. Recently, in
                            an effort to offer our good offices and help the United Nations in their
                            efforts to resolve the dispute, we had sent a mission to Cyprus headed

                            undoubtedly knew, the intra-communal talks were about to begin in Vienna
                            today, and it was the Secretary’s understanding that the parties had new
                            proposals on the table that would be helpful. As he understood it, one
                            side would put forward a new proposal to resolve the territorial
                            question, and the other a proposal to resolve the question of
                            governmental structure. If these proposals were actually discussed, then
                            perhaps we would see progress. This was in the hands of the Secretary
                            General, as an overseeing party to the discussion. We believed we should
                            leave matters in his hands, while supporting his efforts.</p>

                            positions had much in common. He would ask another question—would the US
                            Government agree that no foreign troops should be based in Cyprus, that
                            the Greek and Turkish Cypriots live in peace, that they maintain order
                            with their own small forces, or was its position that foreign troops
                            should be retained there indefinitely.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">The Secretary</hi> said that the first was our view.

                            said that in general Greek Cypriots—Archbishop <persName

                            idea of 30%–31% of territory for the Turks. If that was really so, the
                            Turkish Foreign Minister had said, then the Greek and Turkish positions
                            on the territorial question were not all that far apart. <persName

                            settled and would no longer be a problem. He felt that, in general, the
                            Turks were inclined to take the road toward solution. He believed that
                            if both sides were flexible, we could be optimistic about the future.
                            However, no one should interfere with them, although the US and the
                            Soviet Union should assist and prevent any outside interference. As for
                            military bases, and foreign troops, ultimately these should leave.</p>

                            the conversation by asking how things were going with respect to Cyprus.
                            The Secretary said there had been meetings in London with both Demirel
                            and <persName corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName>.<note n="2"

                                May 10 in London during a <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                                summit meeting. See <ref target="#d94">Documents 94</ref> and <ref
                                    target="#d166">166</ref>.</note> Both had talked a lot about how
                            bad the other one was. We had urged them to cooperate and to work with
                            the Secretary General, emphasizing that it was essential to make
                            progress for the sake of peace in the area. We told them that both are
                            old friends and it is unthinkable that they should go to war. We had
                            urged them to get back to resolving the Cyprus problem after the Turkish
                            elections.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that Demirel had given us a stern lecture about the
                            need to complete the defense cooperation agreement. We had told Demirel
                            we agreed but simply did not have the votes in Congress. At the same
                            time, we pointed out that we had increased our military assistance by
                            $50 million. We needed action on their part, however, to overcome
                            suspicions in Congress arising from their actions in 1974. We told
                            Demirel that if there is progress on the Cyprus question, we believe we
                            can get the votes in Congress.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said we had also urged both Greece and Turkey to solve the
                            Aegean problem, and had warned the Turks against sending their ship back
                            into the Aegean. The Secretary said we gather there has <pb n="136"

                            <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> said this accords with
                            his view. On Cyprus, communal talks would reconvene on the 20th, largely
                            for face-saving purposes. Before any progress is possible, however, it
                            will be necessary to await the results of the Turkish elections on June
                            5.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> said he wanted to
                            report a possibly significant development. The Turks had had a military
                            mission in Famagusta last week studying the situation. The <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> people on Cyprus thought this was the
                            result of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> efforts to press the
                            Turks to make territorial concessions. The mission may have been looking
                            to see what could be given back to the Greeks. <persName
                                corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> said he was convinced that
                            the Varosha section of Famagusta was the principal bargaining point.
                            While the Turks had looted it, they had not moved people in, and it
                            could absorb 40 to 50,000 persons. <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1"
                                >Waldheim</persName> said he was convinced the Turks would not
                            return much more—perhaps a bit south of the Famagusta-Nicosia Road. He
                            doubted that they would give up anything at Morphou.</p>
                        <p>The latest rumor, <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> said,
                            was that while the Turks were proposing two zones, they would want
                            certain areas directly under a central federal government, presumably so
                            that they would have some influence over the Greek zone. <persName
                                corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> said he doubted the Greeks
                            would accept this; they would probably insist on full control over
                            Varosha.</p>
                        <p>Another idea was that the Turks might give up the no-man’s land, which in
                            fact was under <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>-Turkish control.
                            Counting Varosha and the no-man’s land, they would reduce the
                            Turkish-held territory to 32% which could perhaps be further decreased
                            to 29%. This would, however, take many months. The <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> role, <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1"
                                >Waldheim</persName> said, was important in continuing to press the
                            Turks.</p>
                        <p>In response to <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName>’s
                            question about <persName corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName>’ health,
                            the Secretary said we had understood he had lost the use of one fourth
                            of his heart. He wants to come to the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> this summer for a check-up. <persName

                                corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName> also suffers psychologically.
                            He is not an easy man, but he is the only one with the power to keep
                            things together.</p>

                        <p>The early part of the conversation was taken up with a discussion of His

                        <p>I referred again to the sense of appreciation I had continued to feel for
                            the exceedingly hospitable reception he had extended to me and my
                            colleagues on the occasion of our visit to Nicosia. I mentioned my
                            gratification at the excellent talks we had had and I felt it was
                            important that we had become friends and could speak in the future, as
                            we had in the past, with complete candor. He agreed that our visits had
                            been good ones and he expressed his appreciation for our continuing
                            interest in his island.</p>
                        <p>I thanked him for all that he had done to assure that Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_PT_1">Papadopoulos</persName> would present a
                            territorial proposal in Vienna. I suggested to His Beatitude that the
                            proposal presented, while apparently not acceptable to the other side,
                            certainly constituted the confirmation of the personal agreement that I
                            had had with His Beatitude to present such a document. I further
                            suggested that the proposal on the structure of the new government
                            presented by the Turkish Cypriots was affected by the pending Turkish
                                election.<note n="3" xml:id="d38fn3">The constitutional proposal put
                                forward by the Turkish Cypriots at the Vienna talks in March–April
                                called for a central government on Cyprus with highly limited
                                powers; that is, one that had little jurisdiction in areas dominated
                                by Turkish Cypriots. The Greek Cypriot proposal called for initial
                                establishment of a federal state. For an overview of the proposals,

                            negotiators were under severe restrictions at the time due to any
                            possible public reaction to the proposition presented by them. His
                            Beatitude evidenced some understanding of this and that then led to a
                            discussion regarding the Turkish election.</p>

                        <p>We agreed that if Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> had
                            obtained a clear majority in the election it would make it easier for
                            him to make decisions and take decisive action. However, the hope was
                            expressed that he still might be able to construct a government that
                            would be a workable one. His Beatitude suggested this might take some
                            period of time and that we would, of course, watch developments with
                            continuing interest.</p>
                        <p>I said that, after permitting some period of time to pass, President
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> thought it would be
                            important for us to return to the Eastern Mediterranean. I referred to
                            the fact that I had a telephone conversation with President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> during the morning in which we
                            had a discussion of the Cyprus matter and that he indicated the same
                            continuing degree of interest as he had had from the beginning.<note

                            back to Cyprus. He indicated that he felt that the talks we had had
                            before were very useful, and that he intended to cooperate in a further
                            effort to find the correct solutions to this complex problem.</p>
                        <p>I said that developments would determine the time of our next visit and
                            that we would be in touch with him to make sure that the trip would be
                            set at a time completely convenient to His Beatitude. He indicated he
                            did not intend to do much traveling and that we would be welcome when it
                            seemed appropriate for us to return. He expressed his appreciation for
                            the telephone call and then advanced the thought that the continued
                            interest of the United States in Cyprus was a vital factor in the months
                            that lie ahead.</p>
                        <p>My personal reaction to the conversation is that the Archbishop made a
                            definite effort to be friendly, cooperative and appreciative. I believe
                            that the conversation accomplished all that we hoped it might.</p>

                                >Kyprianou</persName> to describe the current situation on Cyprus,
                            particularly since February.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> responded that the
                            Cypriot government had lived up to all its commitments, and at Vienna in
                            April had done everything possible to move the Cyprus negotiations
                            forward. The Greek Cypriot map was complete and comprehensive in
                            contrast to the Turkish Cypriot constitutional presentation, which was
                            totally inadequate.</p>
                        <p>Since Vienna, an aura of disappointment had settled over Nicosia. Nothing
                            of substance had occurred. There were still ceremonial talks taking
                            place in Nicosia, but no progress of any kind had been recorded. A
                            further meeting or two had been set for July to determine whether
                            another full round of talks should be scheduled in Vienna. The Cypriots
                            are skeptical about the utility of such a round, and Archbishop
                                <persName corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName> has made it clear
                            that there will be no talk for the sake of talking.</p>
                        <p>The Cypriot government does not want to give the world the impression
                            that something has been achieved when, in fact, nothing has been
                            achieved. The main effort had to be focused in Ankara, and the key to a
                            solution rested with the new Turkish government and not with <persName
                                corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName> suggested that <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                >Ecevit</persName> should be in a position to make more concessions
                            on Cyprus than any other Turkish leader, but that his initial statements
                            had been disappointing and discouraging.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> concluded that Cyprus
                            was on the eve of several crucial months and in this connection asked
                                <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> if he intended to
                            follow up on his earlier mission. <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1"

                            to be vital to any chance for progress.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> said the <gloss

                            soon be made toward a Cyprus settlement. We, too, had been disappointed
                            with developments in the past several months, but attributed the slower
                            pace to the Turkish electoral situation. Even the Turkish memorandum on
                            the constitution perhaps should be seen in the light of the fact that no
                            Turkish government, on the eve of an election, could have authorized a
                            more forthcoming document, knowing that it might be made public at any
                                moment.<note n="2" xml:id="d39fn2">See <ref target="#d38fn3"

                            <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> went on to say that the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> did not want just any agreement
                            on Cyprus, but one that was fair and had a chance to endure. Partition
                            of the island was clearly not the answer. Nor did either of the
                            documents presented by the parties in Vienna provide a real future
                            blueprint. This was too bad, but understandable. No negotiator ever puts
                            forward his total position in his first presentation.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> said that the momentum
                            achieved during his previous visit in February had to be restored. The
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> intended to talk to the new
                            Turkish government in this sense, pointing out to Ankara the unique
                            opportunity that now existed to settle the problem for the good of
                            Turkey, <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> and overall stability in
                            the Eastern Mediterranean. <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1"
                                >Clifford</persName> said that for the moment we were marking time
                            until we could get an accurate reading of the Turkish situation. We were
                            also beginning to prepare for our next move, and in so doing had come to
                            a number of conclusions. First, it was evident that no solution could be
                            reached quickly if the matter were left exclusively to the two
                            communities on Cyprus. Both Greece and Turkey had an important role to
                            play in the process. Secondly, though all the various issues in the
                            Eastern Mediterranean were inter-related, it was important to keep
                            Cyprus separate. Mixing the issues together could only complicate the
                            chances for solving any of them. Finally, a Cyprus solution was only
                            possible if both communities compromised with respect to the structure
                            of a future government. It was not enough to fall back on words like
                            sovereignty, viability, independence. These concepts were susceptible to
                            varying interpretations. In <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1"
                                >Clifford</persName>’s view what was possible was a federation on
                            the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> model. This could provide a
                            large measure of local autonomy together with an effective, functioning
                            central government. Local authorities could be responsible for
                            protecting life and property, collecting some taxes, running schools and
                            social services, but the pre-eminent authority would belong to the
                            central government.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> said that at the right
                            moment, he and his group were prepared to go out to the area again. He
                            was prepared to be active, but only if the parties asked him to be
                            active and raised no obstacles to further <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> involvement. <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1"
                                >Clifford</persName> said he would only return to the area at a time
                            convenient to the parties—all the parties—and that in the meantime, the
                            two communities on the island should continue whatever contacts they
                            could. There was a psychological value in meetings, even if progress was
                            limited. Conversely, a break-off could effectively set back the
                            negotiating process.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> noted that, so far, the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> had only been involved
                            procedurally. Our participation in Vienna was clearly of this sort, and
                            we were reluctant about moving into the substance of individual issues.
                            Nonetheless, we were flexible, and if the parties wanted greater <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> involvement or participation, we would
                            certainly be willing to move in that direction. For example, if the
                            parties wanted, he or members of his team could come to Cyprus and
                            remain on the island for some time.</p>
                        <p>Our willingness to help, said <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1"
                                >Clifford</persName>, was based on the American peoples’ continuing
                            interest in Cyprus. This interest is most clearly reflected in the
                            Congress. Anything hopeful that occurs on the island assists our
                            involvement. Conversely, anything unpleasant complicates our involvement
                            and makes it more difficult for the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            to be of assistance. In this connection, <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1"
                                >Clifford</persName> mentioned the trial of the murderers of

                            guilty had thus far been positive. The penalties were admittedly
                            relatively mild, but most Americans feel that at least action has been
                            taken and that the killers had been identified, tried and punished to
                            some degree. In this connection, <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1"
                                >Clifford</persName> said that the American people and the Congress
                            would note with concern any commutation or lessening of the sentences of

                            drafted with great care and difficulty, and already embodied serious
                            concessions. There were limits to how far the Greek Cypriots could go,
                            particularly since the <pb n="142" facs="0175" xml:id="pg_142"/>Turkish

                            for any further <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> initiatives.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">CURRENT SITUATION</p>
                        <p>We have essentially been marking time on Cyprus since the Vienna round of
                            intercommunal talks and the start of the Turkish electoral campaign some
                            three months ago. This inactivity will have to continue at least until a
                            new Turkish government is firmly in place, a process that seems to be
                            nearing completion. The odds now are that former Prime Minister Demirel
                            will succeed in reconstructing the three-party coalition which governed
                            Turkey for the last two years. We should know by the July 16–17 weekend
                            if Demirel will be successful. Should Demirel fail, <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> may be given a second chance or
                            the process of working toward some kind of grand coalition could begin
                            and take a further month to resolve.</p>
                        <p>A Demirel-<persName corresp="#p_EN_1">Erbakan</persName>-<persName
                                corresp="#p_TA_1">Turkes</persName> coalition would not easily make
                            concessions on Cyprus. But Demirel badly wants an improved security
                            relationship with the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and
                            recognizes that Cyprus is increasingly a drag on Turkey’s international
                            position. In addition, <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> has
                                <pb n="143" facs="0176" xml:id="pg_143"/>adopted a moderate,
                            constructive tone on Cyprus and might allow Demirel to make the
                            necessary concessions toward resolving that issue, while vigorously
                            expressing opposition on other matters. Thus, we tend to think that
                            regardless of the outcome of the government formation process in Ankara,
                            there is a chance for movement on Cyprus, something we ought to be ready
                            to exploit if it is found to exist.</p>
                        <p>As we see the situation, the period from late August to late September
                            might be the time for a further move on Cyprus, assuming formation of a
                            Turkish government before August 1. Such a <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> initiative would revive the negotiating momentum
                            achieved immediately after the <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1"
                                >Clifford</persName> Mission last February and could set the stage
                            for further substantive efforts by the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and others on
                            Cyprus later this fall and winter. It might also help prevent a major
                            debate on Cyprus at the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> General
                            Assembly which convenes on September 20, as well as dampening the fuss
                            about Cyprus at the Belgrade <gloss target="#t_CSCE_1">CSCE</gloss>

                                >U.S.</gloss> effort to move on Cyprus may be impossible. This could
                            happen if the Turkish political situation remains unclarified or if one
                            or more of the parties refuse to deal with us. But in an attempt to
                            explore possibilities for early action, we have quietly but actively
                            sought the counsel of the parties to the dispute, our Western allies,
                                <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> officialdom, and the Congress as

                            cooperation we are able to elicit. Ankara holds the key to progress on
                            Cyprus and we know that the Turks are suspicious of outside involvement,
                            and are tough bargainers who do not make concessions easily. We also
                            know that Turkish patience in dealing with the <gloss target="#t_US_1"

                        <p>Our next approach to Turkey must, therefore, be carefully conceived and
                            executed. In our judgment this can best be done by channeling our

                            in Ankara. We think Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SRL_1"
                                >Spiers</persName> should be authorized to probe Turkish positions
                            on Cyprus and the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Turkish security
                            relationship, and to ascertain through a series of conversations
                            whether, how and when further Western initiatives might be undertaken.
                            Our further decisions would thus be taken on the basis of our
                            Ambassador’s assessment, presumably sometime in mid-August.<note n="5"

                        <p>(b) <hi rend="italic">Preparing for an initiative.</hi> If the Turks are
                            at all responsive to the idea of new outside activity on Cyprus, the
                            question remains as to the content of such an initiative. Until now, as
                            you are aware, we have sought to limit ourselves to procedural aspects
                            of the Cyprus problem. But given the inability of the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> to do more than preside over the
                            negotiating process and the unwillingness of all the parties immediately
                            involved to make innovative proposals, some form of outside substantive
                            involvement would appear to be essential if any early progress is to be
                            made.</p>
                        <p>There are two major areas where such an effort might be centered: (1)
                            helping the two sides devise elements of a government structure which
                            would contain both a central authority and local autonomy for the
                            Turkish zone and (2) development for presentation to the parties of
                            compromise territorial ideas. (The Greek-Cypriot map tabled in April
                            allotted 20 percent to the Turkish zone; <persName corresp="#p_DR_1"
                                >Denktash</persName> now controls 36 percent of Cyprus, but has
                            spoken of accepting 32.8 percent. An outside proposal in the 25–30
                            percent range might greatly speed the negotiating process.)</p>
                        <p>The Greek Cypriots have already responded positively to the concept of
                            this kind of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> substantive
                            involvement; the Turks will be somewhat more reluctant, but even they
                            would regard <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> involvement as
                            preferable to that of any other party. Unless you have objection, we
                            would favor beginning to develop proposals in these two areas <pb

                            Mediterranean issues. To be frank, nothing much of value has resulted
                            from these consultations. We know, too, that the Greeks, Cypriots and
                            most of all the Turks, are suspicious of too much outside involvement,
                            which they view as a form of pressure on them for concessions. Two weeks
                            ago, the British sent a ten-man delegation to Washington to discuss the
                            future of their Sovereign Base Areas in Cyprus and to discuss informally
                            what we might consider doing together with respect to Cyprus. We agreed
                            only to study some ideas, and to stay in touch with one another.</p>
                        <p>For the immediate future, we are inclined to think that the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> should work alone as much as possible,
                            keeping the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> and British, and to a
                            lesser degree our other European friends, advised of what we are
                            planning and doing. At a later time, when the contours of a Cyprus
                            settlement become clearer, it might be useful to bring appropriate
                            western influence to bear on the parties. German involvement might be
                            particularly helpful at later stages in the process.<note n="7"

                            in explaining our policies on the Hill. For both reasons, we would like
                            to continue to work closely with him, and begin to develop substantive
                            positions and strategies in close consultation with him. Depending on
                            developments, for example, it might be useful for <persName

                            that he had.</p>
                        <p>He emphasized that there was widespread disappointment among the Greek
                            Cypriots over the lack of progress since the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> Delegation visited Cyprus, Greece and Turkey in
                            February of this year. He believed that there was considerable euphoria
                            at the time over the progress made with the problem and the suggestion
                            that it might be settled in the year 1977 was accepted enthusiastically.
                            Since then, however, it was felt there had been no appreciable
                            attainments. He felt strongly that the Turkish Cypriots had not complied
                            with the Turkish agreement made with me regarding the tabling in Vienna
                            of a plan for the structure of the new government. He suggested that it
                            was the opinion of the top officials in Nicosia that the submission by
                            the Turkish Cypriots in Vienna had been so unreasonable that it could
                            not, under any stretch of the imagination, be considered as compliance
                            with the understandings. In fact it caused considerable alarm because
                            the effect of such a memorandum was to create two separate countries
                            instead of unifying Cyprus as an independent, sovereign state. For these
                            reasons he thought it best to down-play any feeling that we had
                            regarding progress even though he conceded that the bringing of the
                            parties together and the tabling of memoranda had not been accomplished
                            before.</p>
                        <p>He was quite voluble in suggesting that the present difficulty over
                            Famagusta was the most dangerous development that had occurred for some
                            time. It clearly demonstrated to him that instead of the Turkish
                            Cypriots attempting to find areas of agreement, they were creating new
                            and alarming issues of confrontation.</p>
                        <p>The previous hope that the Turkish Cypriots under pressure from Ankara
                            might be reasonable in negotiating has been completely destroyed by
                            their intransigence regarding Famagusta.</p>
                        <p>This action has led a number of Greek Cypriots to feel that it is
                            probably impossible to deal with <persName corresp="#p_DR_1"
                                >Denktash</persName> and his Turkish Cypriots because they
                            constantly react to any bargaining effort with a counter-proposal that
                            destroys any possibility of compromise. Famagusta is considered to be a
                            symbol and if the Turkish Cypriots proceed to acti<pb n="149"
                                facs="0182" xml:id="pg_149"/>vate it and proceed on the assumption
                            that it is theirs, then emotions will run very strong in Nicosia.</p>
                        <p>He expressed the hope that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> would
                            recognize the impact of this incident upon future negotiations and would
                            take steps to convince Ankara not to go on with the Famagusta
                            exploitation. I in no way suggested that there was any specific action
                            that could be taken in this regard but that it would be a matter to
                            discuss and consider by the members of our team. He expressed some
                            concern over the impact that the Archbishop’s death would have upon the
                            course of the negotiations. I replied that the Archbishop’s wisdom,
                            judgment and moderation would be greatly missed, but that after a short
                            interval there was no reason why the work could not go forward. I told
                            him I thought it was important that the intercommunal talks should
                            proceed even if no accomplishments result; that it was valuable to have
                            the parties in contact so that at least the illusion of negotiating was
                            created. I said that we had received some setbacks these last few months
                            but that it was entirely possible that the next series of developments
                            would be beneficial. I told him we were not discouraged and that these
                            temporary difficulties merely emphasized our determination to stay with
                            the problem until it was solved. He found this encouraging and took it
                            as an occasion of expressing his appreciation to our government and to
                            this effort that was being made.</p>
                        <p>He brought up the subject of the difficult weeks that lay ahead for the
                            Greek Cypriots. No one else had the standing and appeal to the populace
                            that the Archbishop had. Careful consideration was being given to the
                            means by which the strongest and most effective new government of Cyprus
                            could be created. I assured him that our relationship with the Republic
                            of Cyprus was such, and our confidence in its leaders was firm, that we
                            would continue to support it in its place in the family of nations. I
                            assumed that there would be a proper succession in accordance with
                            constitutional processes and that this would in no way diminish our
                            receptivity for a relationship with the Republic of Cyprus.</p>

                            Uncertainty.</p>
                        <p>1. The death of <persName corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName> has
                            removed one of the few relatively stable factors from the complex
                            political equation in the Eastern Mediterranean. It is possible that the
                            Greek Cypriot leadership succession will be quickly sorted out, that an
                            authoritative leader will emerge, and thus that intercommunal
                            negotiations can be relaunched without undue delay. On the other hand,
                            and perhaps more likely, we may be faced with a prolonged period of
                            uncertainty and the prospect of resumed negotiations indefinitely put
                            off. This would raise an immediate challenge to the current course of
                            our policy: How can we reasonably insist that the Turks make progress in
                            Cyprus when the Greek Cypriots have no leader with a mandate to
                            negotiate and when it is unclear how much time must pass before
                            realistic negotiations can again be carried on?</p>
                        <p>2. We believe that the prospects for a period of prolonged uncertainty
                            are sufficiently great that we should consider possible alternatives to
                            our present policy. We also believe that such a situation might provide
                            a basis for persuading a majority of Congress that a continuation of
                            current policy is not beneficial to US interests. We here present, in
                            action memorandum format, our analysis and recommendations regarding the
                            new situation.</p>
                        <p>3. Issue for decision:</p>
                        <p>—Should the administration, in light of a changed situation in Cyprus, be
                            prepared to make an effort with Congress to secure endorsement of the
                            US-Turkish Defense Cooperation Agreement (<gloss target="#t_DCA_1"
                                >DCA</gloss>), and if so, on what terms? Such an effort, if decided
                            upon, should be undertaken after a reasonable pause to allow the
                            situation in Cyprus to become clearer but with an eye to the
                            congressional calendar which we understand calls for adjournment in the
                            early fall.</p>
                        <p>4. Essential factors.</p>
                        <p>—Until now, favorable congressional action on the <gloss
                                target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> has not been considered possible
                            without visible progress on Cyprus (i.e., Turkish concession). It has
                            also been believed that Turkey would, in its <pb n="151" facs="0184"
                                xml:id="pg_151"/>own interest, make concessions on Cyprus to permit
                            congressional action on the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> within
                            acceptable time limits.</p>
                        <p>—The corollary belief was that <persName corresp="#p_M3_1"
                                >Makarios</persName> was not only willing to settle for a Cyprus
                            solution on terms less satisfactory than those that had existed prior to
                            the Turkish intervention in 1974, but also that he was capable of
                            imposing such a solution on the Greek Cypriot community.</p>
                        <p>—Any elected successor to <persName corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName>
                            will probably need substantial time to build up the political power and
                            prestige necessary for him to be able to impose such a solution. (If the
                            September by-election of a successor is followed by another election in
                            February 1978, the period before an effective and decisive government
                            emerges in Nicosia will be longer.)</p>
                        <p>—Under these circumstances, the Turks will not move unilaterally and the
                            possibility of progress toward a Cyprus solution will be put off until
                            at least mid-1978 and perhaps longer.</p>
                        <p>—If the approval of the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> remains tied
                            to progress in Cyprus when progress is impossible, the US-Turkish and
                                Turkish-<gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> relationship will
                            continue to deteriorate and our larger security interests in the Eastern
                            Mediterranean will be impaired. The continued decline in Turkish defense
                            capability will set up a variety of pressures and problems which could
                            lead to a weakening of Turkey’s Western commitment and further embitter
                            Turkish-Greek relations.</p>
                        <p>5. Options—The broad choices presented below are between continuing our
                            present policy under the probable new circumstances created by <persName
                                corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName>’ death or making a variety of
                            adjustments in our policy to meet the new circumstances.</p>
                        <p>Option A. Continue our present policy, i.e., not actively seek
                            congressional endorsement until there is enough progress on Cyprus to
                            eliminate the risk of congressional rejection of the <gloss
                                target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>. (Variant: ask for unilateral Turkish
                            concessions as a goodwill gesture to <persName corresp="#p_M3_1"
                                >Makarios</persName>’ successor.)</p>
                        <p>Pro:</p>
                        <p>—The objective situation in the Eastern Mediterranean has not changed.
                            The Turkish side holds more territory than is justified and should make
                            concessions. Without Turkish concessions the Cyprus problem will remain
                            unresolved. (While we present this as a pro argument—one that will be
                            made by proponents of continuing pressure on Turkey—it is based on what
                            we believe to be the mistaken assumption that putting pressure on the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> will resolve the Cyprus
                            problem.)</p>
                        <p>—From the point of view of the administration’s relationship with
                            Congress, this appears to be the least costly course of action in the
                            short run.</p>
                        <pb n="152" facs="0185" xml:id="pg_152"/>
                        <p>Con:</p>
                        <p>—This policy has not in itself produced Turkish concessions for the last
                            two and a half years, and its chances now are further cut by the
                            uncertainty in Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>—There is no assurance yet that any Greek Cypriot leader will soon have
                            enough real authority to negotiate a settlement and commit his community
                            to it. Even if the winner of the by-election genuinely wished to
                            negotiate an agreement, the prospect of another election in February
                            1978 could deter him from undertaking the potential political risks of
                            settlement. Conversely, a settlement negotiated by an interim leader
                            might possibly be disavowed by his successor.</p>
                        <p>—The <gloss target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> will not throw away bargaining
                            chips by making concessions outside of a negotiating framework and
                            without a clear trade-off.</p>
                        <p>—The Turks will not understand our continuing to apply pressure on them
                            for progress in Cyprus when the Greek Cypriots are unable to conduct
                            negotiations on a settlement for perhaps an indefinitely prolonged
                            period. They no doubt will regard our continuation of such a policy as
                            both unrealistic and unfair, and they probably will draw inferences
                            about our aims that will be further damaging to our relations.</p>
                        <p>—With the passage of time, Turkish resentment of US congressional
                            pressures is hardening, Turkish military capability to contribute to
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> defense is drastically
                            deteriorating, and Turkish willingness to consider strategic
                            alternatives to association with the US and <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss> is increasing.</p>
                        <p>—Congress is not monolithic on this issue. In the long run, important
                            elements could blame the administration if Turkey turned away from
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> towards neutralism, or became
                            pro-Soviet or pro-Arab.</p>
                        <p>Option B. Continue to insist that prior progress is necessary for <gloss
                                target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> approval but advise the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> of the precise minimum offer it must
                            make to meet our need with Congress, and commit ourselves to seek
                            congressional endorsement once that offer is made regardless of Greek or
                            Greek Cypriot reaction.</p>
                        <p>Pro:</p>
                        <p>—If successful, this course would eliminate the main source of damage to
                            our bilateral relationship with Turkey and would rationalize our
                            approach to our security position in the Eastern Mediterranean.</p>
                        <p>—This course would make it clear to the Turks administration is willing
                            to invest efforts in seeking congressional approval of the <gloss
                                target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> simply being manipulated by insatiable
                            Greek Cypriots or the Greek Lobby.</p>
                        <p>—Such an arrangement would tend to dampen Turkish fears that whatever
                            prior concessions are offered will merely whet the appetite of the Greek
                            Cypriots and their partisans.</p>
                        <pb n="153" facs="0186" xml:id="pg_153"/>
                        <p>Con:</p>
                        <p>—The US would become a self-appointed arbiter, involved directly in the
                            substance of the maneuvering and bargaining over Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>—Either side or both might be alienated by the US position.</p>
                        <p>—The Turks, not having much confidence in US constancy, might be
                            reluctant to offer up concessions simply in return for US aid without
                            any guarantee of a settlement.</p>
                        <p>Option C. Actively seek early congressional endorsement of the <gloss
                                target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> arguing that this important to our and
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>’s political and security
                            interests and that the uncertain situation in Cyprus makes continuing
                            linkage unrealistic and counter-productive.</p>
                        <p>Pro:</p>
                        <p>—If successful, this course would eliminate the main source of damage to
                            our bilateral relationship with Turkey and would create a basis for
                            continued positive Turkish military participation in <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>—The Turks might feel obliged to make concessions after endorsement.</p>
                        <p>—Even if the Turks did not make concessions, Cyprus would be no farther
                            from a settlement than it is now, our influence with the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> would be higher, and our relationship
                            with Turkey would be sounder.</p>
                        <p>Con:</p>
                        <p>—We would appear to be countenancing Turkey’s hard-line approach to
                            Cyprus, encouraging future Turkish intractability, and tempting
                            disregard of our conditions on other matters.</p>
                        <p>—We would be vulnerable to charges of political expediency, of relegating
                            moral principles to a secondary position, and of taking advantage of
                                <persName corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName>’ death to settle
                            short.</p>
                        <p>—The Greeks and the Greek Cypriots would be incensed. Their responses
                            would be emotional and perhaps damaging to our interests.</p>
                        <p>—The international anti-Turkish propaganda campaign (now focussed on
                            human rights issues) conducted successfully by the Greek Cypriots for
                            the last several years would be intensified and the US might also become
                            a target. Opponents of the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> in
                            Congress might be given additional ammunition as a result of Greek
                            Cypriot efforts this fall at the Council of Europe and the Belgrade
                                <gloss target="#t_CSCE_1">CSCE</gloss> follow-up conference.</p>
                        <p>—The effort to win congressional approval might not work and its failure
                            would further damage our bilateral relationship and our security
                            position.</p>
                        <p>Option D. Seek congressional approval of the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1"
                                >DCA</gloss> on a “condition subsequent” basis (i.e., the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> would be committed to take specific
                            moves after congressional endorsement).</p>
                        <pb n="154" facs="0187" xml:id="pg_154"/>
                        <p>Pro:</p>
                        <p>—The “pro” factors listed for Options B, C, and D would apply.</p>
                        <p>—The elimination of public linkage would make it politically easier for
                            the Turks to move.</p>
                        <p>—A linkage would continue to exist, however, and Turkish concessions
                            could be relatively assured.</p>
                        <p>—Improvement of the Turkish-US relationship would not, as the Turks view
                            it, be left dependent on the Greek Cypriots and their partisans.</p>
                        <p>Con:</p>
                        <p>—Some members of Congress would still be reluctant to agree to an
                            arrangement which would appear to be abandoning linkage.</p>
                        <p>—Negotiation of the subsequent conditions would be difficult—and would
                            involve us directly in the substance of the issue.</p>
                        <p>—The Turks would be reluctant to make any concessions not publicly
                            defensible. Given its own internal weakness, as well as the weakened and
                            uncertain state of the Greek Cypriot administration, the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> might find it difficult to make
                            significant concessions even on this basis.</p>
                        <p>Option E. Abandon the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> and seek with
                            Congress and the <gloss target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> a new way of
                            restoring our relationship.</p>
                        <p>Pro:</p>
                        <p>—The Turkish <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> is not a perfect
                            instrument. It has become a symbol of executive-legislative conflict.
                            The delay in endorsement has aggravated the Turks.</p>
                        <p>—A less formal basis for our relationship might give us more
                            flexibility.</p>
                        <p>Con:</p>
                        <p>—Under foreseeable circumstances the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>

                        <p>—A formal basis for our relationship is necessary not only because of

                            internal Turkish political and economic dynamics which have begun to
                            move the <gloss target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> away from the West.</p>

                            introduce so much uncertainty and delay into the Cyprus settlement

                                closest possible US-Turkey relationship. There is also no question
                                that these two matters must be examined in tandem. This policy

                                be a valuable tool as this effort continues. You should also know
                                that while we intend to proceed expeditiously, the issues involved
                                are sufficiently complex that early decisions are unlikely. There

                            terms, placing special emphasis on the necessity for US action to bring
                            about Turkish concessions. He affirmed his country’s readiness to
                            proceed with intercommunal talks, but said that care must be taken to
                            avoid a future inconclusive round. The Secretary said we were prepared

                            process. He expressed mild optimism that Turkey might be prepared to
                            take some positive steps in the months ahead, and said that he would
                            have a clearer picture of this prospect following his next meeting with

                            the Cypriots to speak to those who had not made a sufficient financial
                            contribution to this <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> effort. The
                            Cypriots agreed to do so, and said in response to US urging that they
                            would also be prepared to scale down their rhetoric and recourse to
                            international fora at such time as a serious Cyprus negotiating process

                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> began with a gloomy
                            assessment of the Cyprus situation. He said he could detect no change at
                            all in Turkish attitudes in recent months and that in the absence of
                            such change, he doubted that progress could reasonably be expected
                            anytime soon. It was for this reason that the Cypriots had come to rely
                            so heavily on the United States. American initiatives were most welcome.
                            The United States was in a position to play an important and
                            constructive role, if only because Turkey cannot for long ignore the
                            United States. The Cypriot Government sincerely believes that if Turkey
                            is made to feel that the situation in Cyprus has become intolerable—not
                            because Cypriots think so—but because the United States and Western
                            Europeans are fed up with the continuing stalemate, only then will there
                            be a possibility of movement. Until then, said <persName
                                corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName>, there is little reason for
                            optimism.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> said he did not
                            wish to disagree, but that on the basis of his initial conversation with
                            Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName> and
                            the trip which <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Matt Nimetz</persName> had
                            undertaken to Ankara on his behalf several weeks ago, he was somewhat

                                corresp="#p_BD_2">Bitsios</persName> and the Turkish Foreign
                            Minister on October 1 might also provide some new insight on Turkish
                                thinking.<note n="4" xml:id="d43fn4">According to reports in the
                                Turkish press, this meeting lasted for 2½ hours, during which the
                                Foreign Ministers of Greece and Turkey discussed Cyprus and the
                                territorial dispute over the Aegean Sea.</note> In any event, it
                            seemed premature to suggest now that there was absolutely no chance of
                            movement.</p>
                        <p>Responding to a question from Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_CI_1">Christophides</persName>, the Secretary said that
                            one source of optimism was the very fact that the Turks were anxious to
                            meet with him a second time and to continue the dialogue which <persName
                                corresp="#p_NM_1">Matt Nimetz</persName> has begun in Ankara. The
                            Secretary suggested that it was our current view that the new Turkish
                            government was in a position to act on Cyprus if it wished. Although
                            superficially the same coalition that ruled Turkey before July, the
                            current government seemed to have come to some clearer internal
                            agreement about policy and this too provided some basis for
                            optimism.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> expanded on the
                            Secretary’s comments by suggesting a new flexibility in the Turkish
                            Government’s attitude toward Cyprus was discernible. We are not certain
                            how much flexibility exists or in which direction the Turkish Government
                            is prepared to act. It was these questions we have been seeking to
                            answer through our dialogue with the Turks over the past several weeks.
                            We have asked them how far they are willing to go to help reinvigorate
                            the negotiating process. We have tried to assure them that we will not
                            push them in directions they cannot go, but we want them to act in areas
                            where action is possible. We know that Turkey has problems. It has
                            internal economic difficulties. It has domestic security problems. There
                            is also Cyprus and the Aegean. Nonetheless, our sense is that the
                            current government knows it has to face up to these problems if it
                            wishes to stay in office for the next four years.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_CI_1">Christophides</persName>
                            said that information had come to the Cypriot Government suggesting that
                                <persName corresp="#p_EN_1">Erbakan</persName> had been given
                            greater influence over economic matters but that in return, he had
                            surrendered some flexibility on Cyprus. This could prove to be a very
                            hopeful development. President <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName> said that he had seen these same reports, but
                            wondered whether the new Turkish coalition could really move beyond
                            positions taken earlier this year. The Turkish Government clearly wanted
                            the US arms embargo lifted. The Cypriot Government, in contrast, wanted
                            it kept in place. President <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName> dis<pb n="158" facs="0191" xml:id="pg_158"
                            />claimed any intention of interfering in US internal affairs, but
                            insisted that removal of the embargo would destroy any chance of
                            constructive movement on Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> said it was the
                            US view that the negotiating process should be kept going. He said we
                            appreciated the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Secretary-General’s
                            view that the process not be allowed to turn into a charade. Care must
                            be taken before a further round is convened. Our interest, said the
                            Secretary, was not to act as or become a mediator, but only to assist
                            the process of intercommunal talks under the Secretary-General’s
                            aegis.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RZ_1">Rossides</persName> interrupted to
                            say that what Cyprus really wanted from the United States was some form
                            of protection. The Cypriots wanted US assurances that they would not be
                            exposed to further aggression from Turkey. When the Secretary noted that
                            this had been a matter which he had discussed repeatedly with Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_RZ_1">Rossides</persName> over the years,
                            President <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> said that it
                            was premature to talk about a system of guarantees before we know what
                            is to be guaranteed. The outlines of a Cyprus solution were needed
                            before one proceeded to discuss the guaranty question. President
                                <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> also agreed with
                            the Secretary that it was important that there not be further
                            intercommunal talks just for the sake of having talks. Before a further
                            round is scheduled, it was important to know what kind of proposals
                            would be forthcoming from the Turkish side. The Greek Cypriots have put
                            forward their ideas. The Turks in contrast have said little of substance
                            on either the territorial or constitutional questions. It is time for
                            the Turkish side, said <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName>,
                            to say what they have in mind.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> noted again
                            the importance of the United States in extracting concessions from
                            Turkey. He insisted that the United States had an important role to play
                            because Turkey will only be forthcoming if US pressure is exerted on it.
                            President <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> repeated this
                            theme several times as did Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_CI_1"
                                >Christophides</persName>. Both also noted the serious negative
                            consequences that would flow from a further unsuccessful negotiating
                            round.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName>
                            emphasized that we would continue to make an effort to obtain movement
                            from Turkey. They cautioned, however, that too much should not be
                            expected from our next meeting with Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName>. A real breakthrough was
                            most unlikely. What we have embarked on is a process of discussion with
                            the Turks that will probably continue over several months and not lead
                            to any dramatic results.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary promised to keep the Cypriots informed of developments in
                            these discussions, and expressed the hope that the Cypriot Government
                            would be willing to enter into serious negotiations if the Turkish side
                            agreed to do so. President <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName> assured the Secre<pb n="159" facs="0192"
                                xml:id="pg_159"/>tary that the Cypriots were ready, and were waiting
                            only for a meaningful, positive signal from the Turks before agreeing to
                            resume the intercommunal talks.</p>

                                by Turkish troops and the rest of the island.</note> The Finnish
                            Government intended to take its troops out. The Canadians are also
                            thinking of withdrawing. Other nations with contingents on the Island
                            seemed also to be restless. The major question was funding. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_LJF_1">Leonard</persName> noted in this
                            connection that some of the countries with forces on Cyprus were three
                            years in arrears in receiving payments from the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LNC_1">Ledsky</persName>
                            suggested that the key question was getting adequate contributions from
                                <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> members who were not now
                            contributing a fair share. It would accordingly be most helpful if the
                            Cypriot Government would speak to some of these countries. The Secretary
                            underscored the importance of this suggestion by noting the possibility
                            of future peacekeeping forces in Rhodesia and Namibia.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_CI_1">Christophides</persName>
                            said he knew about the Finnish situation, but had heard nothing about
                            the possibility of a Canadian withdrawal. He realized as well the
                            importance of the funding question and said his Government would be
                            prepared to speak to France and certain other countries who were not
                            making a fair contribution. He wondered if the US could supply a list of
                            those countries we deemed most stingy, and which we felt the Cypriot
                            Government could best approach. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LJF_1"
                                >Leonard</persName> agreed to do so.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Cyprus Economy</p>
                        <p>The Secretary enquired as to the current status of the Cypriot economy.
                            President <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> responded
                            that things were not going badly. There was internal confidence, and a
                            measure of prosperity had been re-established. At the same time, the
                            President insisted that Cyprus still had problems. The economy was not
                            anywhere near pre-1974 levels. There were still major refugee needs to
                            be met. Almost one-third of the entire Cypriot population were turned
                            into refugees in 1974, and this situation could not be quickly
                            corrected. Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_CI_1"
                                >Christophides</persName> interjected at this point a statement of
                            appreciation for the US contribution to refugee relief and
                            reconstruction projects. He said American aid was greatly appreciated,
                            but was still very much needed.</p>

                            Fora</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> noted that the Turkish
                            side was extremely sensitive to campaigns directed against it by the
                            Cypriots in international conferences and in the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss>. The United States recognized that so long as the
                            negotiating process was stalled, it was natural that the Cypriots would
                            take their case to world public opinion. The time may come, however, if
                            we are successful in getting a serious negotiating process restarted
                            that this campaign should be halted, and we wondered whether the Cypriot
                            Government would be prepared to cooperate.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> said that one
                            of the obligations of his Government was to keep the Cyprus issue alive.
                            It was the least he could do in the absence of progress. The Cypriots
                            have the right—indeed the duty—to bring the matter to the attention of
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>. The Cyprus problem was a serious
                            international issue, in which there had been no real movement in recent
                            years. President <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> said
                            his government would have to bring the question up in the General
                            Assembly next month, but that if something of substance developed in the
                            negotiating process the Cypriot Government would be willing to scale
                            down public discussion in international fora. Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_CI_1">Christophides</persName> agreed, saying that such
                            a curtailment would be in the interest of the Cypriot Government once a
                            serious negotiation with the Turkish side began.</p>
                        <p>The meeting closed with a brief discussion of what President <persName

                            agreed that the Cypriots would indicate that the meeting, in which a

                            useful and constructive.</p>

                        <p>Turning to <hi rend="italic">Cyprus</hi>, the President emphasized our
                            reliance on the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> in this matter, and
                            our willingness to coordinate closely while the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss> played the leading role. <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1"
                                >Clark Clifford</persName> may go back to the island. <persName
                                corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> said that the problem was
                            with the Turks who would not discuss territorial matters seriously. The
                            US should pressure the Turks on this. The Greeks are afraid that the
                            Turks will use another round of talks only to create the illusion of
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> said he was told
                            yesterday by the Turks that they would be “flexible and generous”.<note
                                n="2" xml:id="d44fn2">No record of the meeting was found.</note> It
                            remains to be seen what this means. The President pointed out that the
                            Turks want a general security agreement with the US. Congress would not
                            agree to this without a Cyprus settlement, and even though the Turks
                            reject this linkage, it is there. <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1"
                                >Waldheim</persName> said that the Greeks and Turks both have
                            confidence in him and he is prepared to resume meetings this year if he
                            is sure the Turks will talk substance.</p>

                        <p>The meeting opened with the President’s expression of his and the
                            American people’s deep concern with the Cyprus issue.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> stressed the
                            fact that Cyprus relies on the US and supports the charter
                                principles.<note n="2" xml:id="d45fn2">Reference is presumably to
                                the Charter of the United Nations. Since the Turkish invasion of the
                                northern portion of Cyprus in 1974, debate in international bodies
                                such as the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> considered the
                                question of whether or not this act constituted a violation of the
                                principles of the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Charter.</note>
                            The issue is not an internal Cypriot matter, but a question of Turkish
                            involvement. The Greek Cypriots must contend on an unequal basis since
                            the Turkish Cypriots are backed up by the Turks. (<persName
                                corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> then provided a short
                            description of the situation in Cyprus.) There must be, he concluded, a
                            viable, lasting solution.</p>
                        <p>In response to the President’s question, <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName> said that the Greek Cypriots would accept a
                            federation (not a confederation), assuming that the territorial issues
                            were settled. He stressed that any non-unitary state would be an
                            unnatural solution, since Cyprus is a unit. The Greek Cypriots will
                            concede 20% of the territory to the Turkish Cypriots, however, if
                            refugees can return to that area and if there is a unitary state.</p>
                        <p>The President asked if <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName>
                            preferred the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> as an intermediary.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> said that was the
                            case, but the Secretary General lacks the power to push for a solution.
                            That must be the US role.</p>
                        <p>The President warned against overestimating our power, but promised to do
                            what we could. When he saw <persName corresp="#p_KK_1"
                                >Karamanlis</persName> and Demirel last May in London, there seemed
                            little prospect for progress; now may <pb n="163" facs="0196"
                                xml:id="pg_163"/>be a better time to try.<note n="3" xml:id="d45fn3"
                                >See <ref target="#d94">Documents 94</ref> and <ref target="#d166"
                                    >166</ref>.</note> The Turks have a problem with the American
                            Congress. They want a Defense Cooperation Agreement and we have
                            explained to the Turks that they must make some progress on Cyprus, even
                            though they reject the idea of linkage. The whole matter is very
                            complicated and the Turks demand more than 20% of a federal state. There
                            are also differences on the exact form of government. Both Cypriot sides
                            should sit down together under <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                            auspices and stay there until they reach an agreement. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clark Clifford</persName> is ready to return
                            whenever there is hope for at least partial success. We are eager to
                            participate in the settlement process. We will cooperate with the
                            Secretary-General and do not seek a preeminent role.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> emphasized that,
                            contrary perhaps to previous times, the Cypriots unequivocally support a
                            US initiative. They seek a just solution in terms of <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Resolutions and human rights. A just
                            settlement is in everybody’s interest; partition will be a source of
                            continuing friction.</p>
                        <p>The President asked if the Cypriots envision federation something along
                            the US model. What would be the proportion of Greek/Turkish
                            representation?</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> said the US model was
                            relevant and that the representation could be either in terms of ratios
                            of population or have added features assuring Turks of additional
                            representation on matters of special interest. Representation is not a
                            stumbling block as long as it is not an issue of confederation. The
                            status quo, partition, must not be legalized.</p>
                        <p>The President replied that he and the American people agreed completely.
                            The next step was to see what the Turks tell Secretary <persName

                            today; then see if a new <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1"

                            consult with the Secretary General and get things moving. Flexibility is
                            needed on both sides. We will, within the bounds of rationality,
                            encourage the Turks to be forthcoming on Cyprus. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName> and Demirel say that Cyprus
                            is relatively less important; they are more afraid of a war breaking out
                            over the Aegean problem. We will keep focusing their attention on
                            Cyprus.</p>

                            failed to respond. The mere idea of federation is a big concession. The
                            Turks must now follow suit.</p>
                        <p>The President asked what the Cypriot preference concerning the Sovereign

                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> pointed out that
                            interpretations of principles can vary. Ultimately the parties must
                            reach an agreement. We must keep the Turks, members of <gloss

                        <p>3. Secretary said <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> position had been
                            made very clear on a number of occasions. The administration favors in
                            principle <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>’s with both Turkey and
                            Greece. One of the factors to be taken into account in asking Congress
                            to act on Turkish <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> will be situation
                            in Eastern Mediterranean. Clearly Cyprus was one important element of
                            Eastern Mediterranean situation. But direct linkage has never been made
                            and will not be made between Cyprus and decision to press Congress to
                            approve Turkish <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>. Secretary said
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> continued to attach great
                            importance to solution of Cyprus problem and this had also been stated
                            to <gloss target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss>. We hoped and expected that
                            Turkish side would come forward with realistic proposals on territory
                            and constitutional questions, but we would have to wait and see what
                            developed before deciding what action to take. Secretary said <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> had not described to him or

                                >Waldheim</persName> what would be proposed on either territorial or
                            constitutional question but had stressed commitment to federal solution.
                            He hoped that proposals would be positive and forthcoming and constitute
                            basis for resumed intercommunal dialogue. Secretary agreed with
                                <persName corresp="#p_DN_1">Dimitriou</persName>’s comment that
                            proposals should not only be concrete but open way to meaningful
                            negotiating process. Secretary hoped that proposals would be
                            constructive and that response by Greek Cypriots would be also. He urged
                                <persName corresp="#p_DN_1">Dimitriou</persName> that <gloss

                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_DN_1">Dimitriou</persName> said that <gloss

                            based on premise that substantial progress should be made on Cyprus
                            problem. Proposals alone did not constitute such progress. The Secretary
                            said he took note of this position, but said that we should wait and see
                            what the proposals look like when they are put forward. At that time, we
                            would be able to evaluate them and come to some judgment. He emphasized
                            that no promises or assurances had been made while he was in Ankara.</p>

                                northern Cyprus. There have been no recent instances of large-scale
                                or politically inspired cruel or inhuman treatment of persons on
                                Cyprus. It is generally accepted, however, that violations of human
                                rights in the form of cruel and inhuman treatment of civilians and
                                prisoners were committed in the courts of the Greek-led coup against

                            concern that report seemed to equate victims with those who perpetrated
                            situation. Secretary stressed that human rights was fundamental concern
                            of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> foreign policy and was of utmost
                            importance. Law required Department to file reports with Congress on all
                            countries which received assistance. We had tried in the 109 reports
                            sent to Congress January 31 to record as accurately as possible factual
                            situation. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> said he had
                            personally reviewed Cyprus report and felt it was a fair statement of
                            the situation. The Secretary added that it was necessary that even
                            information based on hearsay be covered in such reports. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> said he thought Turkish Cypriots
                            would probably not like parts of report and could understand why <gloss

                                >Dimitriou</persName>’s comment that the administration continues to

                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_DN_1">Dimitriou</persName> said the <gloss

                            continue to do all it can to advance Cyprus settlement.</p>
                        <p>8. The Secretary reiterated that while we recognize principal
                            responsibility lies with parties under auspices <gloss target="#t_UN_1"

                            aspects of the Cyprus problem. It remains a matter of great concern to
                            us that movement be made toward a solution. The Secretary said he had
                            spoken personally with Secretary <pb n="167" facs="0200" xml:id="pg_167"

                            it would be useful. We hoped positive proposals will be put on table in
                            February which will pave way to resumed negotiations. <persName

                            objective. Regrettably, on account of the administration’s stance in the
                            Larnaca incident and on the Cyprus problem in general. <persName

                            received his message and to make following points: a) We wanted good
                            relations with Cyprus, but the statements that were currently being made
                            on the island did not move us in that direction; b) <persName

                                <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> concerning the Larnaca
                            incident; and b) Rumors to the effect that agreement had been reached

                                >Kyprianou</persName> suggested that he be authorized to state that

                            would be back shortly.</p>
                        <p>6. After consulting with the President, the Secretary telephoned
                                <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> again and told him
                            that he could say that he had discussed the Larnaca incident with the
                            Secretary and that the latter had stated: “The message from President
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> to President

                            blame on either Egypt or Cyprus in connection with this tragic
                            incident.” Secondly, the Secretary said that <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName> was authorized to state in connection with

                            discussions in Ankara that “those discussions were technical discussions
                            and no agreement was entered into and no commitments were made.”</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> reiterated to the

                                >U.S.</gloss>-Cyprus relations and suggested that a discussion of
                            our bilateral relations would be useful in this connection. The

                            classification). Dear Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>I very vividly recall the meeting which we have have had in New York on
                            the 5th of October, 1977, which I believe has contributed substantially
                            to the better understanding and cooperation between the United States
                            and Cyprus. That meeting together with the statements which we both made
                            after the meeting created, at least in Cyprus, the right climate and
                            impressions in so far as the relations between the United States and
                            Cyprus are concerned.<note n="2" xml:id="d48fn2">See <ref target="#d45"
                                    >Document 45</ref>. The statements made after the meeting were
                                not found.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Since then, certain things have happened which spoiled to some extent the
                            excellent atmosphere which we then created.</p>
                        <p>I am sending this message to you to express certain views in all
                            frankness, because I earnestly believe that in the relations between
                            true friends frankness and sincerity is the best approach. Needless, Mr.
                            President, to emphasize how much I value your personal friendship and
                            the friendship of the United States towards Cyprus. I am anxious to do
                            whatever I can to improve to the maximum possible degree our relations
                            and our cooperation and I am equally anxious to see the image of the
                            United States in Cyprus at its proper level.</p>
                        <p>At our meeting in New York you told me that the United States will do its
                            utmost to assist for a just solution to the Cyprus problem and also that
                            the embargo is definitely linked with the Cyprus problem and that that
                            was the position not only of the Congress but also of the
                            administration.</p>
                        <p>I am fully convinced of your keen interest for both an early and a fair
                            and equitable solution to the Cyprus problem in conformity with the
                            resolutions of the United Nations, as I am fully convinced of the
                            important role that the United States can play in this respect.</p>
                        <p>I am today addressing myself to you, Mr. President, in the first place
                            with regard to the question of the arms embargo against Turkey and I
                            wish to express certain views on the matter in the light of rumours that
                            the administration is thinking of reconsidering its policy on this
                            issue.</p>
                        <p>It is my firm belief that if the embargo were to be lifted, the prospects
                            for a just solution to the Cyprus problem would be entirely destroyed.
                            Turkey will show no moderation, despite possible promises to the
                            contrary, and the present unacceptable situation entailing so many evils
                            on the people of Cyprus will be prolonged. As a consequence, the wider
                            are involved will not be enabled to acquire the desirable stability and
                            security.</p>
                        <p>The arms embargo against Turkey was imposed by the Congress of the United
                            States in relation to the question of Cyprus and most spe<pb n="171"
                                facs="0204" xml:id="pg_171"/>cifically because of the American law.
                            I have no doubt that its untimely lifting will also result in the deep
                            disappointment of all Greeks who sincerely wish to hold high the image
                            of the United States.</p>
                        <p>The lifting of the embargo without the removal of the reasons which
                            necessitated its imposition would give rise to accusations against the
                            United State of non compliance with the American law and of its declared
                            policy, as well as for lack of consistency.</p>
                        <p>Recalling again our meeting in New York, Mr. President, I was then indeed
                            very happy to hear from you that the question of Cyprus was definitely
                            linked with the question of sending arms to Turkey and the granting of
                            help to that country and that there ought to be substantial progress
                            towards a solution of the Cyprus problem before the whole matter could
                            be reconsidered by the administration and the Congress. I was also very
                            much impressed by your sincere and precise words that the Turks had used
                            American military equipment in their operation against Cyprus and that
                            the American people have reacted against this through their
                            Congress.</p>
                        <p>I earnestly hope that you will be able, Mr. President, to continue the
                            same course of line on this important question.</p>
                        <p>The second matter upon which I would like briefly to touch upon is the
                            question of the violation of human rights in Cyprus. I was very much
                            disturbed by the report which you have submitted to the Congress in
                            relation to this matter.<note n="3" xml:id="d48fn3">See <ref
                                    target="#d46fn5">footnote 5, Document 46</ref>. The full report
                                begins: “Perhaps more so than elsewhere, human rights questions in
                                Cyprus cannot be treated in isolation from political
                                considerations.”</note> The question of human rights should never be
                            connected with any political considerations and in so far as the actual
                            violation of human rights in Cyprus by Turkey is concerned, the report
                            of the Human Rights Commission of the Council of Europe is quite clear
                            about it, namely that human rights in Cyprus have flagrantly and
                            persistently been violated by Turkey.<note n="4" xml:id="d48fn4">

                                of the Commission, July 10, 1976. The report was issued by the
                                Council in response to Application Nos. 6780/74 and 6950/75, brought
                                by the Government of Cyprus against the Government of Turkey,
                                alleging that the Turkish invasion of the northern portion of Cyprus
                                and ongoing military occupation constituted violations of
                                international law and human rights norms. Although <persName

                                multifaceted conclusions of the Council, the report clearly cited a
                                number of Turkish violations relating to the invasion and subsequent
                                occupation of northern Cyprus.</note> I trust that you have in your
                            possession this report but, if you don’t, we will be glad to provide you
                            with a copy. As far as the Council of Europe is concerned, it is not
                            correct that the Committee of Ministers did not endorse the report. The
                            matter is still pending before the Committee, again, unfortunately, for
                            purely political reasons.</p>

                            certain that you would wish to find out all the truth about the

                            lies with the Egyptian side. But I am quite ready to forget everything
                            and do whatever I can towards the restoration of our relations with
                            Egypt, with which our friendship and cooperation has always been very
                            close. I would be grateful if you would be kind enough, to give the
                            necessary advice to President <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                                >Sadat</persName> with a view to responding to my repeated requests
                            for trying to restore our relations in the interests of both countries,
                            as well as in the interests of the entire area.</p>
                        <p>I have decided to send this message to you, Mr. President, in my fervent
                            desire to contribute to the maximum possible degree towards the
                            improvement of the relations between the United States and Cyprus which
                            I very much value. The people of Cyprus and myself think highly of the
                            United States and of yourself, and on our part we shall not fail to do
                            anything with a view to fostering our relations and the image of the
                            United States in Cyprus, something which we consider very important for
                            more than one reason.</p>
                        <p>Finally, I am wondering, Mr. President, whether the time has not come to
                            consider the possibility of a new meeting between the two of us in a new
                            effort to promote further our relations and understanding, but this is
                            for you to decide. Such a meeting, I believe, might prove most
                            constructive and useful.</p>
                        <p>I do not intend to make this message public. I consider it as a private
                            and personal message.</p>
                        <p>With my best regards and wishes and the expression of my highest

                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_MA_2">Michaelides</persName> said that <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> was rather concerned that no progress
                            was being achieved on Cyprus problem. Greek Cypriots were now expecting
                            proposals from Turkish side but did not know when or even if proposals
                            would be made, whether, if made, they would make resumption of the
                            negotiating process possible. Secretary said he shared <persName
                                corresp="#p_MA_2">Michaelides</persName> hope that Turkish proposals
                            will be made, will be constructive and will lead to substantive dialogue
                            and real progress.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_MA_2">Michaelides</persName> said the Greek
                            Cypriots were keen to solve the problem. He said he understood that
                            after the Turkish Cypriot proposals were given to Secretary General
                                <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName>, the latter would
                            consult with the parties. <persName corresp="#p_MA_2"
                                >Michaelides</persName> said he hoped this procedure would be
                            followed since it was essential for fruitful negotiations. He asked
                            whether the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> could play a role at
                            this stage to assist, in consultation with the Secretary General, in
                            narrowing the gap in positions to make effective negotiations possible.
                            The Secretary responded that he had told <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1"
                                >Waldheim</persName> and the parties that we would leave the matter
                            in the Secretary General’s hands. If he or the parties requested <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> assistance, we would be glad to help.
                            However, we did not want to intrude ourselves into the situation.</p>

                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_MA_2">Michaelides</persName> said he was not
                            suggesting replacing the Secretary General’s role. Quiet <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> efforts could perhaps help bridge what
                            he was sure would be an initial gap in positions. Too large a gap in
                            positions would keep the Greek Cypriots from negotiating and time would
                            be lost. <persName corresp="#p_MA_2">Michaelides</persName> said the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> wanted to think positively;
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> assistance to the Secretary
                            General would be of great help.</p>
                        <p>5. The Secretary said he had discussed matter with <persName

                            interfere in the Cyprus problem. He did not understand that position
                            since Turkey had asked <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> views on

                            was that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> should not involve
                            itself either. <persName corresp="#p_MA_2">Michaelides</persName> said
                            he thought there was room for quiet, high level diplomatic efforts to

                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> felt that <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> arms restrictions represented the only really
                            practical means of pressure on Turkey. The arms embargo was not
                            total—arms supplies from the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            continued. He saw the restrictions as a means of telling Turkey that the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> did not agree <pb n="175"
                                facs="0208" xml:id="pg_175"/>with its aggression on Cyprus.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MA_2">Michaelides</persName> doubted very much
                            that the Turks would negotiate and make concessions if the embargo was
                            lifted and they no longer had an incentive nor would <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> be able to overcome opposition
                            objections to concessions on Cyprus should the embargo no longer provide
                            a need to move. <persName corresp="#p_MA_2">Michaelides</persName> said
                            he hoped the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> would keep in mind
                            that there might be a catastrophic reaction among public opinion in
                            Cyprus if attempts to solve the Cyprus problem failed because the
                            embargo was lifted. He asked the Secretary whether the administration
                            had reached a conclusion in its decision process.</p>
                        <p>9. The Secretary said he had nothing to add to what had already been said
                            on the subject. <persName corresp="#p_MA_2">Michaelides</persName> said
                            he hoped the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> concerns would be
                            taken into account.</p>
                        <p>10. In response to a question, the Secretary said the Turkish Government
                            previously indicated that Cyprus proposals would be forthcoming. The
                            Secretary expected that they will make proposals but did not know about
                            the timing, nor did we have any information on the substance of the
                            proposals. <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> was, however,
                            clearly committed to a federal solution.</p>
                        <p>11. <persName corresp="#p_MA_2">Michaelides</persName> agreed that a true
                            federal solution would be best for both communities, but stressed the
                            importance of including provision for the principles of freedom of
                            movement, settlement, and right of property. He also expressed a feeling
                            that <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> would be a serious
                            obstacle to any real progress.</p>
                        <p>12. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> said Department only
                            had press reports to go on but it appeared the Turkish side might delay
                            putting proposals forward. During his February visit to Ankara,
                                <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> said the Turks were
                            actively working on the proposals.<note n="5" xml:id="d49fn5">
                                <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> was in Ankara February
                                21–24.</note> We understood that a major effort at the highest level
                            had been made, although we had no information on details of the
                            proposals.</p>
                        <p>13. <persName corresp="#p_MA_2">Michaelides</persName> said that the
                            territorial question was especially important. The Secretary said the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> had long recognized and stated
                            to all parties that territorial and constitutional questions were
                            equally important. Both would have to be dealt with constructively to
                            achieve a solution.</p>
                        <p>14. The Secretary suggested, and <persName corresp="#p_MA_2"
                                >Michaelides</persName> agreed, that in this delicate period it
                            would be best to say to the press simply that the Secretary had looked
                            forward to meeting <persName corresp="#p_MA_2">Michaelides</persName>
                            for the first time for a general review of the situation in the area and
                            to be brought up to date on <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>
                            views.</p>
                        <pb n="176" facs="0209" xml:id="pg_176"/>
                        <p>15. <persName corresp="#p_DN_1">Dimitriou</persName> said that President
                                <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> would be grateful
                            if he could have the Secretary’s home telephone number. The Secretary
                            agreed that it could be provided.</p>
                        <p>16. <persName corresp="#p_DN_1">Dimitriou</persName> also asked when
                                <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> might expect a
                            reply to his recent letter to the President. The Secretary said he hoped
                            such a reply could be sent next week. He noted that the President had
                            been extremely busy recently with southern Lebanon, the Panama Canal
                            Treaty, the coal strike, etc.</p>
                        <p>17. The remainder of the conversation was directed to Cyprus/Egypt
                            relations (septel) before <persName corresp="#p_MA_2"
                                >Michaelides</persName> met briefly with the Secretary alone.<note

                        </opener>
                        <p>Thank you for your message of March 2 about relations between our two
                            countries and the prospects for a settlement on Cyprus.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d50fn2">See <ref target="#d48">Document 48</ref>.</note> I
                            fully share your desire to maintain the close and cooperative ties that
                            we long have enjoyed. As you know, I deeply believe that a just and
                            lasting Cyprus settlement is in the interest not only of the peoples of
                            the Eastern Mediterranean, but of the world at large.</p>
                        <p>From the start of my Administration, I have tried to promote such a
                            solution through the intercommunal negotiations conducted under <pb
                                n="177" facs="0210" xml:id="pg_177"/>Secretary General <persName
                                corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName>’s auspices. That commitment
                            was also demonstrated by the mission that former Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clark Clifford</persName> undertook at my request
                            in February 1977; in our own discussions in New York last October; in
                            the numerous meetings that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1"
                                >Vance</persName> has held over the past year with his Greek,
                            Turkish, and Cypriot counterparts and with the Secretary General and
                            other U.N. officials; and in the constant diplomatic efforts that we
                            have made, in public and in private, to encourage meaningful and
                            productive negotiations. I can assure you that these efforts will
                            continue. At the same time, I would hope that your government will take
                            advantage of any opportunity that might arise to engage in negotiations
                            on the substance of the Cyprus problem.</p>
                        <p>You ask whether current <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> restrictions
                            on arms sales and assistance to Turkey might soon be lifted. As I am
                            sure you recognize, the United States has a number of important
                            interests in the Eastern Mediterranean; among these are the maintenance
                            of a strong southern flank of <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> and
                            the strengthening of relations with all nations in the area. I assure
                            you that the United States will fully consider all relevant factors
                            before we make a decision about our military assistance commitments in
                            the area. One of these factors will be the course of events in the
                            Eastern Mediterranean.</p>
                        <p>As you have noted, the advancement of human rights worldwide is a
                            fundamental foreign policy objective of my Administration. It applies to
                            Cyprus as much as to any other country. The depth of <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> commitment is clear from the
                            substantial contributions that we have made since 1974 to the relief and
                            rehabilitation of displaced persons on Cyprus, from our support for
                                <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP_1">UNFICYP</gloss>, from the intense
                            diplomatic efforts that we have devoted in recent months to encouraging

                            from the continuing effort to promote an overall Cyprus settlement. In
                            all these endeavors we have been motivated by deep humanitarian
                            concern.</p>
                        <p>I share with you the hope that normal relations between your government
                            and Egypt will soon be reestablished, and I can assure you that, as
                            appropriate occasions arise, we will continue to do what we can to help
                            you both heal the breach.</p>
                        <p>I enjoyed meeting with you in New York to discuss how relations between
                            our two countries could be further improved, and I am sure you will
                            agree that our two governments should engage in the fullest possible
                            exchange of views in the important period that lies ahead. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> has told me that he
                            spoke with you by telephone on February 26 and was able to clear up
                            certain misunderstandings that had <pb n="178" facs="0211"

                        <p>1. I am deeply concerned that an opportunity to resume the Cyprus
                            intercommunal negotiations may be lost on account of the intransigence
                            and posturing of both sides.<note n="3" xml:id="d51fn3">For an overview
                                of the recent intercommunal negotiations under <gloss

                            This is, I believe, a critical moment for Cyprus, and a further
                            opportunity to bridge the gap and move towards a settlement may not
                            arise for several years to come. I have spoken with <persName
                                corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> and have urged him to persist
                            in the efforts to <pb n="179" facs="0212" xml:id="pg_179"/>bring the two
                            sides together. I have pledged him our full support in this endeavor,
                            and have undertaken to do what we can to persuade the parties to adopt a
                            more flexible and forthcoming approach. The Secretary General said that
                            he would welcome any such assistance.</p>
                        <p>2. For Ankara: You should see <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                >Ecevit</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_OG_1">Okcun</persName>
                            as soon as feasible and speak along the following lines:</p>
                        <p>(a) As you know, the administration does not link repeal of the arms
                            embargo with progress on the Cyprus issue. You also know that the
                            administration making a very strong effort with the Congress to secure
                            approval of the President’s program. Nevertheless, you should recognize
                            that the administration is waging an uphill battle. Anything further
                            which will help demonstrate a forthcoming Turkish attitude on Cyprus
                            will be of great assistance in this regard.</p>
                        <p>(b) In our view, the new Turkish Cypriot proposals (to the extent we know
                            them) represent only a minimal advance. Frankly, we had hoped for a more
                            flexible and forthcoming approach. The constitutional proposal, while
                            more detailed than the one tabled in Vienna last year, appears to be
                            unduly rigid.<note n="4" xml:id="d51fn4">See <ref target="#d38fn3"
                                    >footnote 3, Document 38</ref>.</note> We recognize that you are
                            prepared to negotiate on territory, but the areas you have said you are
                            willing even to discuss seem much too imprecise. Finally, your Varosha
                            proposal, while welcome, strikes us, in its present form, as probably
                            unworkable.</p>
                        <p>(c) We recognize that you have assured <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1"
                                >Waldheim</persName> and us that the Turkish side would be prepared
                            to be flexible when negotiations resume. However, it is difficult for
                            the Secretary General to commit himself to reconvening the talks on the
                            basis of verbal assurances alone; he needs something more in the way of
                            concrete evidence of your side’s intentions.</p>
                        <p>(d) Accordingly, we would strongly urge you to re-examine the proposal to
                            see whether improvements can be made in all three areas, but
                            particularly with respect to Varosha and territorial matters. For
                            example, we do not believe a solution can be reached unless Varosha is
                            Greek-administered. If you find you cannot make any actual changes in
                            what has already been drafted, you could perhaps define more fully to
                                <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> the range of your
                            negotiating options, indicating flexibility in these specific areas. If
                            this is done, we have reason to believe the Secretary General will call
                            for meetings.</p>
                        <p>(e) We very much appreciate Turkish readiness to reach a fair and lasting
                            settlement on Cyprus. However, we are concerned that with the passage of
                            time a settlement will be all the more difficult to negotiate, and we
                            would urge that you take the extra step to ensure that the present
                            opportunity to resume negotiations is not lost.</p>
                        <pb n="180" facs="0213" xml:id="pg_180"/>
                        <p>(f) We are making an approach also to <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName> since we recognize fully that moving this
                            negotiating process forward will require a willingness on the part of
                            the Greek Cypriots to give a positive response when the Secretary
                            General calls for a resumption of talks.</p>
                        <p>3. For Nicosia: You should plan to see <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName> at the earliest opportunity and speak to him
                            along the following lines:</p>
                        <p>(a) We can understand your government’s disappointment at the new Turkish
                            Cypriot proposals. From what we know of them, they seem to represent
                            only a minimal advance over earlier Turkish positions.</p>
                        <p>(b) I want to emphasize, however, that these proposals clearly represent
                            only initial positions. They do not set limits as to how far the Turkish
                            Cypriots are prepared to go. <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                >Ecevit</persName>, we understand, has given clear assurances that
                            the Turkish side will be flexible and forthcoming when negotiations
                            resume.</p>
                        <p>(c) I would urge, therefore, that the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1"
                                >GOC</gloss> reconsider its initial negative position and regard the
                            Turkish Cypriot proposals for what they are—a starting point only. If
                            the Cyprus settlement that we all desire is to be achieved, it seems to
                            us that you must be ready to enter into negotiations to put to the test
                            the Turkish side’s expressed readiness to move towards a
                            mutually-acceptable solution.</p>
                        <p>(d) In our view, this is a critical moment for Cyprus. If this
                            opportunity to bridge the gap and move towards a settlement is lost, the
                            prospects are that the situation will be deadlocked for several years to
                            come and that the present unsatisfactory status quo will become
                            increasingly consolidated.</p>
                        <p>(e) I would also urge you not to look at the prospects for resuming
                            negotiations solely through the prism of the arms embargo. President

                            Cypriot cause and specifically to improve international perceptions of

                        <p>2. Addressing the current negotiating prospects, <persName
                                corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> said that we were seriously
                            concerned that the forthcoming congressional vote on the Turkish arms
                            embargo—irrespective of which way it went—could well bring about
                            deterioration in the Cyprus situation and perhaps lead to a deadlock of
                            several years’ duration. In the one case the Turkish side would probably
                            become intransigent, to judge from <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                >Ecevit</persName>’s recent remarks; in the other, the Greek
                            Cypriots. Hence if there was to be any progress in the near future
                            towards a settlement, it was essential that a decisive move towards
                            reconvening negotiations be made very shortly in advance of the
                            congressional vote. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> said
                            that for our part we were actively seeking ways to make it possible for
                                <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> to call for a fresh
                            round of talks. We had made it clear to the Greek Cypriots that now was
                            the time to come to the table and that by maintaining a negative front
                            they would be passing up a possible opportunity to achieve real
                            progress. At the same time, however, both we and the Secretary General
                            needed solid help from the Turkish side; we had to have some new ideas
                            or some concrete indications of flexibility that <persName
                                corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> could use to justify
                            reconvening negotiations and to persuade the Greek Cypriots to come to
                            the table. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> said we were
                            convinced that there was in fact more to the Turkish Cypriot proposals
                            than had been articulated. These had not been presented as clearly as
                            they could have been, and the Greek Cypriots had skillfully exploited
                            the situation.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> responded by stressing
                            that the Turkish Cypriot side was fully prepared to negotiate in earnest
                            and to show maximum flexibility once the talks were reconvened. He was
                            ready and willing to meet <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName> at any time and at any place, and was
                            convinced that movement would be possible if only <persName
                                corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> would agree to sit down and
                            talk. Only dialogue, he stressed, could generate trust and an
                            understanding for the differences that separated the two sides. At the
                            same time, <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> voiced his
                            belief that the Greek Cypriots would continue to refuse to negotiate and
                            instead to focus on the “long struggle” for as long as the congressional
                            debate on the arms embargo continued. He cited the Cypriot High
                            Commissioner in London as telling him that the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1"
                                >GOC</gloss> wanted the Turks to take as hard a line as possible,
                            since this would increase international and congressional sympathy for
                            the Greek Cypriot cause. <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName>
                            also expressed doubts as to whether <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName> had the domestic political strength to
                            conclude a <pb n="183" facs="0216" xml:id="pg_183"/>settlement. He was
                            in fact a servant of the National Council, on which sat powerful
                            political figures who wanted a settlement only if it would bring them
                            all of Cyprus. Even <persName corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName>
                            could not always carry the National Council with him, so how could
                                <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> be expected to?
                                <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> also maintained that
                                <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName>, <persName
                                corresp="#p_CG_2">Clerides</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_LV_1">Lyssarides</persName> had from the start been
                            opposed to the four principles that he and <persName corresp="#p_M3_1"
                                >Makarios</persName> had worked out in February 1977,<note n="5"
                                xml:id="d52fn5">See <ref target="#d31fn5">footnote 5, Document
                                    31</ref>.</note> and that since <persName corresp="#p_M3_1"
                                >Makarios</persName>’ death there had been a steady erosion of these
                            principles, as witness <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                            >Kyprianou</persName>’s increasing stress on majority rule. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> concluded that only through
                            strong pressure from the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> could the
                            Greek Cypriots be induced to work for a realistic settlement.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> asked <persName
                                corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> how he saw the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> exerting this pressure. By lifting the
                            embargo we would be sending a strong signal to the Greek Cypriots, but
                            what else could we do? <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName>
                            said that it was vital that the Turkish side have better publicity. The
                            Greek Cypriots were now able virtually to monopolize international
                            coverage and could, for example, successfully sustain the charge that
                            the Turkish Cypriots were the intransigent party on the missing persons
                            question when in fact quite the reverse was true. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> remarked that this situation now
                            appeared to be changing, pointing out that there was a lot of editorial
                            support in the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> for lifting the
                            embargo and for a resumption of negotiations on the basis of the April
                            13 proposals.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> sought to make it
                            clear that failure to lift the embargo would represent the point of no
                            return for Turkey. Should this be the case, we would be forced to take
                            “certain steps” in the Security Council in mid-June. On the other hand,
                            if the embargo were lifted the Turkish side would be “jelly-like” in its
                            flexibility.</p>
                        <p> 6. Regarding the substance of the issues, <persName corresp="#p_NM_1"
                                >Nimetz</persName> said that it was our view that the constitutional
                            question was inherently the more difficult since the broad philosophical
                            differences that existed on the structure and functions of the future
                            central government did not lend themselves to compromise. Territory was
                            at once more practical and negotiable an issue; one could easily
                            envisage the two sides arguing over a map section by section and
                            gradually coming together. In this connection, <persName
                                corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> remarked that territorial
                            percentages were generally unhelpful and that the April 13 proposals, in
                            avoiding mention of them, had embodied an inherently flexible approach.
                            Unfortunately, however, percentages had become something of a shibboleth
                            both for the Greek Cypriots and for the international community.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> was largely
                            unreceptive to <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName>’ suggestion
                            that the Turkish Cypriots seek to tempt the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1"
                                >GOC</gloss> on the constitutional issue by offering them <pb
                                n="184" facs="0217" xml:id="pg_184"/>more territory, but he echoed
                            the Counselor’s fear that an intercommunal negotiating session involving
                                <persName corresp="#p_OUS_1">Onan</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_PT_1">Papadopoulos</persName> might break up quickly
                            without any results. For this very reason, he noted, the initial, basic
                            discussions would have to be carried on between himself and <persName
                                corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName>. If <persName
                                corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> were able to satisfy him that
                            the Greek Cypriots did not desire to Hellenize all of Cyprus, then the
                            Turkish side would be prepared to leave the door open for future
                            integration by evolution.</p>
                        <p>7. When <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> broached the
                            subject of Varosha, <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName>
                            asked rhetorically whether it was not consistent with a federal system
                            of government for a certain number of Greek Cypriots to live under
                            Turkish Cypriot administration and vice-versa. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> said that we believe
                            differently, namely that Varosha should ultimately revert to Greek
                            Cypriot control. This course would in fact be in the Turkish Cypriots’
                            own interests, since administering some 30,000 Greek Cypriots would be
                            no easy task. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> noted that
                            the Turkish Cypriot position on Varosha, as it was now emerging, was a
                            forthcoming one, and he stressed that the return of large numbers of
                            Greek Cypriots to Varosha under acceptable conditions would have a
                            greater impact than anything else on opinion in the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and in Greek Cyprus. We did not
                            believe that <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> would be
                            able to resist a serious offer on Varosha, but would find himself
                            obliged to return to the table if only on account of the domestic
                            pressure that would develop.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> said that he could not
                            understand why the two Cypriot communities did not encourage greater
                            non-political communication across the green line as a means of breaking
                            down barriers. Bar associations and doctors groups could meet, and there
                            could be joint sports contests. If the limited federalism that the
                            Turkish Cypriots propounded was to work, it would need to be abetted and
                            developed through functional non-political contacts such as these.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> replied that the
                            Turkish side believed firmly in dialogue and was prepared to react
                            favorably to any suggestions for common working groups and the like as
                            long as they were not politically motivated. It was the Greek Cypriots
                            who had intervened and prevented trade union leaders from the two sides
                            from meeting—not the Turkish Cypriots. Unfortunately instances such as
                            the recent <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> attack on Council of
                            Europe <gloss target="#t_Rep_1">rep</gloss> Karasek confirmed that the
                            Greek Cypriots were not interested in compromise but only in imposing
                            their will across the board.</p>
                        <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> asked <persName
                                corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> where the Turkish Cypriot side
                            now stood on the projected missing persons committee and on the
                            reopening of Nicosia Airport. <persName corresp="#p_DR_1"
                                >Denktash</persName> said that he was fully in favor of establishing
                            a missing persons committee on the understanding that it <pb n="185"
                                facs="0218" xml:id="pg_185"/>would operate under <gloss

                                committee jointly with the International Committee of the Red Cross
                                to investigate missing persons in Cyprus.</note> When an <gloss
                                target="#t_ICRC_1">ICRC</gloss> representative had visited Cyprus
                            recently, <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> had asked her
                            whether the <gloss target="#t_ICRC_1">ICRC</gloss> normally held votes
                            when conducting inquiries such as this; she had replied no. With regard
                            to Nicosia Airport, <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> said
                            that he would agree to reopening it to all civilian traffic (not simply
                            U.N.) under the control of a U.N. administrator who would be assisted by
                            an adviser from each community. He would not insist on an equal number
                            of Turkish and Greek Cypriot personnel in the airport’s technical staff;
                            these and other functional questions could be decided upon by the
                            administrator in conjunction with the two advisers. His only
                            pre-condition would be that both zones have equal access to the airport.
                            (This part of the conversation was later relayed to U.N. Under
                            Secretary-General <persName corresp="#p_UB_1">Urquhart</persName>, who
                            said that it seemed to represent an advance over <persName

                            to follow up when he met with <persName corresp="#p_DR_1"
                                >Denktash</persName> on May 22.)</p>
                        <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> took note of <persName
                                corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName>’s readiness to move ahead with
                            a missing persons committee, adding that it was our feeling that the two
                            sides had essentially reached agreement on the substance of this issue
                            late last year. He said that <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName> had asked to see Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_ME_1">Mezvinsky</persName> in New York to discuss this
                            very subject, and that we would be happy to relay to him <persName
                                corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName>’s interest in moving ahead and
                            to sound out Greek Cypriot intentions on this score. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> agreed, and said that he would
                            also like to meet with <persName corresp="#p_ME_1"
                            >Mezvinsky</persName>.</p>
                        <p>11. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> encouraged <persName
                                corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> to press ahead on concrete
                            issues such as the airport reopening and the missing persons committee,
                            and to give adequate publicity to these efforts. Results in these areas
                            would be important not only politically, in that Turkey’s friends in the
                            Congress would have ammunition to use with their colleagues, but also
                            substantively in that the negotiating process would acquire a certain
                            momentum. It was our impression that the Greek Cypriots would begin
                            losing sympathy if they continued to maintain a negative attitude on all
                            issues; it would then be very helpful to the Turkish side if they could
                            portray themselves as positive and forthcoming.</p>

                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> indicating that while the task
                            will be difficult and hard, it was possible to get the embargo
                            lifted.</p>
                        <p>3. In response to the Secretary’s question concerning conditions in
                            Cyprus, <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> said the Turkish
                            area was functioning normally and had reached the point where it could
                            even afford such luxuries as government crises, resignations by the
                            Prime Minister, inflation, etc. The Turkish community had full security
                            in its area; its members were relaxed and could smile. Those who were
                            refugees from the south had no desire to return. The Turkish Cypriots
                            recognized that certain numbers of Greeks would return to their homes in
                            the context of a settlement but there was no similar sentiment on the
                            Turkish side.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> stressed that he was
                            in the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> not only to help make
                            progress toward a Cyprus settlement but to help Turkey which had
                            suffered much internationally as a result of Cyprus.</p>
                        <pb n="187" facs="0220" xml:id="pg_187"/>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> recalled that
                                <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> had asked him earlier
                            this year what margin of territory could be given up. His reply had been
                            it all depended on whether real peace could be achieved. Denktash said
                            he was concerned that the other side did not seriously want a settlement
                            but only wanted to bargain for bargaining’s sake. They were pocketing
                            all Turkish offers but still would not come to the negotiating table. He
                            saw no indication that the Greek-Cypriots wanted to negotiate. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> said he would like very much
                            to meet with <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> while both
                            are in New York but he had received no response to his suggestions of
                            such a meeting.</p>
                        <p>6. The Secretary noted that in <persName corresp="#p_DR_1"
                                >Denktash</persName>’s May 22 statement reference had been made to
                            30,000–35,000 Greek Cypriots who could return to New Famagusta during
                            the negotiating period. <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName>
                            recalled that about 40,000 Greeks had lived in Varosha prior to 1974. Of
                            that total approximately 5,000 had lived in an area which the Turkish
                            Cypriots felt threatened the harbor area and the Turkish town. Thus, the
                            Turks felt that this area should be retained and those affected
                            compensated. However, even this could be discussed in the course of
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>7. The Secretary asked whether some form of <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss> administration of Varosha would be possible while
                            negotiations were proceeding. <persName corresp="#p_DR_1"
                                >Denktash</persName> said he was open to all ideas. A Turkish
                            proposal had been made but he was willing to consider various formulae.
                            The Turkish community was prepared to take political risks provided that
                            a permanent settlement was achieved. The Secretary said he understood
                            the importance of a final and lasting settlement.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> asked whether it would
                            be possible for Secretary General <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1"
                                >Waldheim</persName> to appoint a representative to work on Varosha,
                            or perhaps a sub-group could be set up to work on the matter. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> said he had not thought in a
                            concrete way about modalities. In any event, the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss> would be involved. The first Turkish offer had suggested
                            Turkish-Greek administration but even under that concept the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> would handle the police function.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> said that specific
                            areas should be delineated to which people could return on a graduated
                            basis as negotiations continue. <persName corresp="#p_DR_1"
                                >Denktash</persName> felt that a technical survey of water, sewage,
                            and other municipal services could also be undertaken once negotiations
                            began, perhaps under auspices of a joint <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss>-Greek-Turkish team. In this regard, it might be
                            necessary to come to the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> for
                            financial assistance.</p>
                        <p>9. The Secretary said that Varosha is one of the most important issues,
                            both in factual and symbolic terms.</p>
                        <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> was concerned that
                            the Greeks would prefer now to talk only about the constitutional issue.
                            The Turkish position was that there should be two communities in one
                            Cyprus with each community <pb n="188" facs="0221" xml:id="pg_188"
                            />secure and autonomous in its area. In contrast, <persName
                                corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> said the Greek concept was to
                            restore one Greek Cyprus in which Turks would be accommodated.</p>
                        <p>11. In response to the Secretary’s question on the status of the missing
                            persons issue, <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> said he
                            had fully agreed May 23 to a <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> draft
                            paper in a meeting with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ME_1"
                                >Mezvinsky</persName>.<note n="3" xml:id="d53fn3">The meeting was

                            <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> said the ball was now
                            with the Greek Cypriots. His only pre-condition was that establishment
                            of a missing persons committee should result from a meeting between him
                            and <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> although if
                                <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> continued to refuse
                            to see <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> he might even
                            withdraw that condition. The Secretary said the missing persons question
                            was important to help create a favorable atmosphere.</p>
                        <p>12. The Secretary said that when he met with <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName> on May 25 he would raise the idea of a
                                <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName>-<persName
                                corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> meeting. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> said that he thought the only
                            way progress could be made was through a meeting of the two community
                            leaders who had the responsibility to make decisions. Lower-level
                            negotiations would bog down in press speculation, the constant need for
                            instructions, etc. In his two meetings with <persName corresp="#p_M3_1"
                                >Makarios</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_DR_1"
                                >Denktash</persName> said there had been real breakthroughs and more
                            could have been done if there had been less criticism of <persName
                                corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName> from other Greek Cypriots.</p>
                        <p>13. The Secretary said he felt there was a real opportunity to move
                            forward with the Cyprus problem now. It would be a tragedy to miss this
                            chance. <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> said he wanted
                            to get the process going and his May 22 statement had stressed that
                            point.</p>
                        <p>14. The Secretary suggested to <persName corresp="#p_DR_1"
                                >Denktash</persName> that when he meets with the House International
                            Relations Committee May 25 it would be useful if he could convey a sense
                            of flexibility and a willingness to achieve progress. In closing the
                            meeting, the Secretary indicated that we would pursue the Varosha idea
                            both with the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> and with the Greek
                            Cypriots.</p>
                        <p>15. Prior to the Secretary’s meeting, <persName corresp="#p_NM_1"
                                >Nimetz</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MCW_1"
                                >Maynes</persName> discussed briefly with <persName
                                corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> the June renewal of the <gloss
                                target="#t_UNFICYP_1">UNFICYP</gloss> mandate. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> said he was not informed of
                            the status of current negotiations in Cyprus re: the status of <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> forces in the north, but if such an
                            agreement could be reached soon, he thought the Security Council in June
                            should only extend the <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP_1">UNFICYP</gloss>
                            mandate for two or three months pending various developments including
                            congressional action on the repeal of the Turkish embargo.</p>
                        <pb n="189" facs="0222" xml:id="pg_189"/>
                        <p>16. Nimetz said such an effort by the Turkish Cypriots to use the <gloss
                                target="#t_UNFICYP_1">UNFICYP</gloss> mandate renewal as a weapon
                            would not be helpful to the Turkish side in the eyes of <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> opinion. He urged that <persName
                                corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> consider whether such an
                            approach would not be counter-productive. <persName corresp="#p_MCW_1"
                                >Maynes</persName> pointed out that such an effort could also have
                            an unfortunate effect on the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> force
                            itself. <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> said that the
                            Greek Cypriots would probably try to make substantive changes in the
                            mandate. Such a move would open up the entire issue. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> urged that all parties
                            concentrate on the underlying problems of Cyprus at this key period.</p>

                                >Kyprianou</persName> summarized his private talk with Secretary
                            along following lines. Talk had been useful and very friendly. He and
                            Secretary understood each other well. There were one or two points which
                            they had discussed which <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName> said he and Secretary did not want to divulge
                            to others at this point. They had agreed to disagree whether repeal of
                            Turkish arms embargo would have positive or negative consequences.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> said he had

                            and basic essence of Cyprus problem had to be dealt with.</p>

                            should be private. Secretary confirmed that we would do what we could to
                            bring about such a meeting. However, he cautioned that nothing should be
                            said publicly about such a possible meeting and <persName

                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> said he had reassured

                            although “others” made efforts to create such an impression. He wanted
                            to enhance relations between the two countries to maximum extent.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> said he had formally
                            asked Secretary to study the specific proposal (set forth para 10 below)
                            which he had made to <gloss target="#t_SSOD_1">SSOD</gloss> May 24 and

                        <p>Begin text-unclassified</p>
                        <p>a. I come from a very small country which is situated in a very sensitive
                            area of the world, and we are very much and deeply concerned about what
                            goes on in the field of disarmament and, therefore, in the field of
                            security. We have a problem of our own, which is an international
                            problem. It is a problem which concerns our people; it concerns the
                            area; it concerns the United Nations; it concerns the entire world. And
                            we feel quite sincerely that through strict implementation of the United
                            Nations, and especially General Assembly Resolution 3212 (XXIX), as
                            endorsed by the Security Council, the Cyprus problem will be solved and
                            at the same time Cyprus will cease to be a source of friction and
                            conflict in the world.</p>
                        <p>b. And, taking advantage of this Special Session on Disarmament, I would
                            go a step further and publicly call upon the United Nations to act, and
                            call upon the General Assembly, the Security Council and the permanent
                            members to act, and call upon the United States and the Soviet Union to
                            act. I propose total demilitarization and disarmament of the Republic of
                            Cyprus and implementation of the resolutions of the United Nations; a
                            mixed Greek Cypriot-Turkish Cypriot police force, composed in accordance
                            with the proportions of the population, a police force under the
                            permanent guidance and control of an international United Nations police
                            force. I make this proposition publicly, before all. If the world wants
                            peace, Cyprus is ready to make its contribution, which would be a
                            contribution to our own people, by solving our problem and therefore
                            removing the causes of our drama, but which would at the same time
                            remove the cause of wider friction and wider conflict in the interests
                            of world peace and security. End text.</p>

                            According to <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName>, <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> said that <persName
                                corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> was creating many
                            difficulties for the Turkish side, citing a <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName> statement in Chicago indicating that <persName
                                corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> did not represent the Turkish
                            Cypriots. <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> explained that a
                            meeting without <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> present
                            would imply Turkish acceptance of that view. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName> said he told <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> that he and <persName
                                corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> could make progress if they
                            met alone but that <pb n="193" facs="0226" xml:id="pg_193"/>would not be
                            possible with others present. <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                >Ecevit</persName> made the counter-suggestion of a four-party
                            meeting with <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName> also
                            present. <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName> said a
                            four-party meeting was impossible for both <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName> and the <gloss target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss>
                            but that a <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName>-<persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> meeting might find common ground
                            and establish a base for further negotiations. The Greek side was not
                            against negotiations but was waiting for adequate Turkish proposals.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName> recalled that
                            Elekdag had continued the conversation after <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                >Ecevit</persName> left and had stressed that only <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> of Turkey’s leaders in the
                            recent past did want to solve the Cyprus problem and was in a position
                            to do so. (<persName corresp="#p_ES_1">Elekdag</persName> told DeptOffs
                            separately that <gloss target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> was not seeking to
                            denigrate <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> by <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>’s refusal to meet alone but it
                            simply could not be placed in a position of undermining or discrediting
                                <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName>.)</p>
                        <p>4. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> said he too
                            believed that <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> did want to
                            solve the Cyprus problem. He had internal problems in Turkey and the
                            festering sore of Cyprus took time and attention away from other
                            problems. We were convinced that the Turkish Government did want to find
                            a lasting Cyprus settlement.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> said that British
                            Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_OD_1">Owen</persName> had asked
                            urgently to see him June 2 following a <persName corresp="#p_CJ_2"
                                >Callaghan</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>
                            meeting earlier in the day. (<persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName> said he had agreed to visit London June 23 to
                            talk further with the British about what they could do concerning the
                            Cyprus problem.) <persName corresp="#p_OD_1">Owen</persName> had pressed
                            the four-party meeting idea, but <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName> said he had responded that such a meeting
                            would make Cyprus in part a Greek-Turkish bilateral matter, a result
                            which was unacceptable. <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName>
                            said he had told <persName corresp="#p_OD_1">Owen</persName> that he
                            could not meet <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> on an
                            equal footing. <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> were not on close
                            terms and there was growing opposition to <persName corresp="#p_DR_1"
                                >Denktash</persName> in the Turkish Cypriot community. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> said he was receiving many
                            messages from Turkish Cypriots urging that he not see <persName
                                corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName>. Just before his death
                                <persName corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName> had told <persName
                                corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> that his having met with
                                <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> had created many
                            problems, and thus, <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName>
                            claimed, he was following the <persName corresp="#p_M3_1"
                                >Makarios</persName> line. <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName> said that while <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                >Ecevit</persName> had internal problems, so did he. He thought that
                            no one in Cyprus would tolerate his having met with <persName
                                corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName> said that his initiative to suggest a meeting
                            with <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> showed that he did
                            indeed want progress on the Cyprus problem even before the Turkish arms
                            embargo question was decided.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> said he was willing
                            to meet with <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> in his
                            personal capacity without his being addressed as President of the
                            Republic of Cyprus. An advance announcement was not necessary and he was
                            willing to make an advance commitment to permit a satisfactory meeting
                            to be arranged. He thought that such a bilateral meeting was the only
                            way to see if common ground could be found for eventual re<pb n="194"
                                facs="0227" xml:id="pg_194"/>sumption of intercommunal talks.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> said <persName
                                corresp="#p_OD_1">Owen</persName> had then suggested a <persName
                                corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> meeting with <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DR_1"
                                >Denktash</persName> together. <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName> said it would be unacceptable for the Turkish
                            Prime Minister to meet with the two Cypriot communal leaders, but it
                            might be possible if <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName>,
                            as President of Cyprus, and <persName corresp="#p_DR_1"
                                >Denktash</persName>, as an advisor to <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                >Ecevit</persName>, were to get together with <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>. But there were also practical
                            problems since, according to <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName>, with <persName corresp="#p_DR_1"
                                >Denktash</persName> present it would not be possible to go into the
                            depth of the Cyprus problem and get something concrete. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> said he sincerely wanted to
                            make a breakthrough.</p>
                        <p>7. The Secretary said he had given the matter of arranging a meeting
                            considerable thought since their last conversation. He agreed that it
                            was essential that the present deadlock be broken and that the present
                            opportunity be seized. He recognized the difficulties for both <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName> of arranging an appropriate meeting. The
                            Secretary said he thought there were really only two possibilities: (a)
                            a four-party meeting, and (b) some three-person variation. He hoped the
                            latter could be pursued to see if something could be arranged, perhaps
                            under the auspices of the Secretary General. <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName> said in that case he would have to be
                            recognized as the President of the Government of Cyprus. The Secretary
                            said he thought that <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName>
                            could try to put something together involving <persName
                                corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                >Ecevit</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DR_1"
                                >Denktash</persName> during which <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName> could talk with <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                >Ecevit</persName>. The Secretary said he had not discussed this
                            matter with <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> in any detail
                            but said he thought a quiet meeting in New York under the auspices of
                            the Secretary General might be practical and possible for all concerned.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> said he would think
                            about it further.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> recalled that he had
                            suggested to <persName corresp="#p_PG_2">Pelaghias</persName> June 2 an
                            idea which we knew the Turks would have accepted of a <persName
                                corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_DR_1"
                                >Denktash</persName> meeting under the auspices of <persName
                                corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> at which a date and place for
                            resumption of intercommunal negotiations would have been announced
                            followed by a tripartite meeting involving <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                >Ecevit</persName>.<note n="4" xml:id="d55fn4">No record of this
                                meeting has been found.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> said it was our
                            understanding that the Turks were unwilling to have a three-party
                            meeting without a prior <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_DR_1"
                                >Denktash</persName> meeting. Our view was that the intercommunal
                            talks offered the way to move forward with the problem.</p>
                        <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> suggested that if
                            that were the case, <persName corresp="#p_PT_1">Papadopoulos</persName>
                            should be the one to deal with <persName corresp="#p_DR_1"
                                >Denktash</persName> or with some other Turkish Cypriot. The
                            Secretary stressed that intercommunal talks must be the way to resolve
                            the Cyprus problem, and that if some form of other meeting could take
                            place, it should help find a way for resumption of <pb n="195"
                                facs="0228" xml:id="pg_195"/>talks. The Turkish Cypriots must decide
                            who is their appropriate representative; this was a decision that could
                            not be taken by the Greek Cypriots or other outsiders.</p>
                        <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> said that if a
                            meeting with <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> could not be
                            done properly that he was prepared to withdraw the whole idea which he
                            had initiated. The Secretary said again that an opportunity existed to
                            make a real breakthrough on the Cyprus problem and we would regret if
                            that opportunity was missed. <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName> said he did not see how we could really expect
                            substantive progress since from a Cypriot point of view that would
                            probably facilitate the administration’s effort to get the Turkish
                            embargo lifted. <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> said he
                            could have refused to do anything until the embargo question was out of
                            the way but instead put forward the <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                >Ecevit</persName> meeting idea as a means to achieve a
                            breakthrough. He felt a responsibility to all of the people of Cyprus
                            not to miss any opportunities.</p>
                        <p>11. The Secretary said he commended this positive attitude. We wanted to
                            see the embargo lifted since we felt that was important for <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>, our relations with Turkey and
                            offered the best chance to move forward on Cyprus. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> said he disagreed with that
                            assessment and feared that if the embargo were lifted we would later
                            regret it.</p>
                        <p>12. In response to a question from <persName corresp="#p_NM_1"
                                >Nimetz</persName> on what specifically would come out of a
                            bilateral meeting with <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>,
                                <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> said he would go
                            with open mind and with no fixed ideas in order to find out what
                                <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> really had in mind.
                            The Secretary said he would expect that agreement would be reached that
                            there was sufficient opportunity for progress to resume the
                            intercommunal talks. <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName>
                            said the Turks might abandon their April proposals or do something else
                            to allow resumption of talks. He wanted to find something to justify new
                            talks. <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName> interjected that
                            if <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> was not prepared to
                            accept a true federation there was no sense in proceeding. Secretary
                            said he thought <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> did
                            believe in a federal solution. The Turkish side was prepared to talk on
                            the basis of the <persName corresp="#p_M3_1"
                                >Makarios</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName>
                            principles. He urged again that <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName> consider a three-way meeting with Denktash
                            present which did not necessarily preclude his participating as
                            President of Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>13. <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName> said he understood
                            the problem of excluding <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName>
                            and said he liked the idea of the Secretary General organizing an affair
                            at which there could be a private conversation with <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>. Perhaps the Secretary General
                            could invite the President of Cyprus and the Prime Minister of Turkey
                            and their advisers to such an occasion. The Secretary said he thought
                            the key point was to find a way which would lead to resumed
                            intercommunal talks.</p>
                        <p>14. <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName> asked if <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> would accept such an invitation
                            from <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName>. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> said he was somewhat more
                            pessimistic than the <pb n="196" facs="0229" xml:id="pg_196"/>Secretary
                            since, on the basis of his conversations with the Turks, he thought the
                            most they would accept would be an initial <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_DR_1"
                                >Denktash</persName> meeting, agreement that intercommunal talks
                            should resume, and then a tripartite meeting to include <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>. The Secretary said that
                                <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName>’s statement in
                            Chicago had complicated and made more difficult arranging a meeting with
                                <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>, since it seemed to
                            support the Turkish claim that <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName> was anxious to discredit <persName
                                corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName>.</p>
                        <p>15. <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName> asked whether the
                            Secretary thought it might be preferable if he tried to arrange to meet
                            with Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_OG_1">Okcun</persName>. The
                            Secretary replied that he would not rule out such an idea although there
                            would be a problem if a Turkish Cypriot rep were excluded.</p>
                        <p>16. <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> said he appreciated
                            the Secretary’s deep interest in the Cyprus problem. He and the
                            Secretary then met briefly in private while Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName>, Counselor <persName
                                corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName>, and others talked further in a
                            separate room.<note n="5" xml:id="d55fn5">No record of this meeting has
                                been found.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> emphasized again that it
                            would be very difficult to arrange any high level meeting after the
                            weekend of June 3–4 when <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>
                            and others left the United States. He hoped that the parties could begin
                            discussing substantive questions rather than just various meeting
                            possibilities. He asked whether any thought had been given to just what
                            specifically would come out of a meeting with <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1"
                                >Rolandis</persName> thought that improved rapport between <persName
                                corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> might allow discovery of a new
                            basis for resuming negotiations.</p>
                        <p>17. At the Secretary’s request, <persName corresp="#p_NM_1"
                                >Nimetz</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_ERC_1">Ewing</persName>
                            subsequently met with <persName corresp="#p_ES_1">Elekdag</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_TT_1">Tulumen</persName>. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> said in our view a quadripartite
                            meeting was not possible and suggested that the Turks consider further
                            whether a tripartite meeting with a specific purpose could be arranged,
                            perhaps at the invitation of the Secretary General. We thought such a
                            meeting was important and could be productive. <persName
                                corresp="#p_ES_1">Elekdag</persName> said that <gloss
                                target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> still regarded a <persName
                                corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_DR_1"
                                >Denktash</persName> meeting as the proper first step, but they
                            would consider further the tripartite meeting possibility.</p>
                        <p>18. <persName corresp="#p_ES_1">Elekdag</persName> said that at a June 2
                            reception at the Turkish Embassy <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1"
                                >Waldheim</persName> had told <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                >Ecevit</persName> he was thinking of arranging an informal social
                            gathering June 4 to which <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>,
                                <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName>, <persName
                                corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName>, and <persName
                                corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> would be invited, along with
                            their wives. <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> said he would
                            attend. At such a gathering he assumed there could be appropriate
                            bilateral conversations. <persName corresp="#p_ES_1">Elekdag</persName>
                            said he understood <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> had
                            made a similar proposal to <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName>, who had not responded until earlier that
                            morning when <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> was in a
                            meeting with <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Wald<pb n="197" facs="0230"

                                >Kyprianou</persName> had telephoned <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1"
                                >Waldheim</persName> to say he could not accept such an invitation
                            and had asked to speak on the telephone with <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                >Ecevit</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_ES_1">Elekdag</persName>

                                <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> nor could he

                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> had called
                            from New York. After exchange of greetings and regrets at not being able
                            to meet personally, President <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName> said he wished to assure President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> that “despite whatever
                            differences we may have, I would like to consider you as a friend.”
                            President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> replied that he
                            had enjoyed being with him at their last meeting.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d56fn2">See <ref target="#d45">Document 45</ref>.</note> He
                            said that he felt it was very important to get the intercommunal talks
                            going again and that he hoped President <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName> would do everything possible to achieve this
                            result.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> replied that
                            he had been doing a great deal during the past few weeks but that he
                            still believed that a meeting between <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                >Ecevit</persName> and himself would have been the best way to find
                            common ground. “I offered to meet him in my personal capacity—I think he
                            wanted to do it—but other people advised him against it.” The President
                            replied that we had urged <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>
                            to meet “with you and Denktaş, with Denktaş and <persName
                                corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName> or whatever combination
                            could be worked out.” President <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName> countered, “The other formulas would not have
                            worked—but a private meeting between me and <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                >Ecevit</persName>
                            <pb n="198" facs="0231" xml:id="pg_198"/>would have been much more
                            useful.” President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>
                            observed that such a meeting would have been an insinuation that Denktaş
                            was not qualified to speak on his own and this was a political problem
                            for <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>. President <persName
                                corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> said he would have been ready
                            to meet Ecevit in his capacity as President of the Republic of Cyprus,
                            as recognized by the entire world, and Denktaş could have participated
                            in the meeting as representative of the Turkish-Cypriot community—“but
                            they rejected that also.”</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> said that he had
                            found <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> much more
                            forthcoming than his predecessor. “I believe he genuinely wants to reach
                            a settlement. I know the Turkish proposals are not acceptable to you and
                            we agree that they do not go far enough but they are a basis for
                            discussion. We will use our good offices as best we can and I hope your
                            statements will be adequate to keep things going.” President <persName
                                corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> replied, “As the leader of a
                            small country under occupation, I need to be strengthened with my own
                            public opinion.” “All of us face that problem,” President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> observed, reminding President
                                <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> that we recognized
                            this need and saying that he believed Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> had made that clear to him in
                            the last few days. President <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName> said he greatly appreciated the time Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> and other American
                            officials had given him during recent weeks. “I hate to bother you,” he
                            said to President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>; “you
                            have so many problems.” He suggested a meeting in September when he will

                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> said he looked
                            forward to a possible meeting then but he hoped that meanwhile we could
                            work together closely and exploit every opportunity for progress.
                            President <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> said he hoped
                            in September it might be possible for him to meet with <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>. President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> replied, “I hope we do not have
                            to wait that long—you and I and <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                >Ecevit</persName> can be working together before that time to get
                            talks going.” President <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName>
                            commented on his views of the arms embargo, enquiring whether Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> had explained to the
                            President what his (i.e. <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName>’s) position was. President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> said Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> had indeed explained this to
                            him. “We have tried in good faith to derive some benefit from the
                            embargo,” President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>
                            continued, “but for three years it has not worked—my belief is that the
                            relationship between Greece and Turkey has not been helped and our own
                            relations with both countries are not as good as they were before. It
                            has maintained a wedge between Greece and Turkey and ourselves. It has
                            not encouraged a settlement in Cyprus. I am sure that maintaining the
                            embargo will continue the stalemate we have now.”</p>

                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> said he was
                            frightened of the consequences of lifting the embargo.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> assured

                            regardless of the outcome of the vote in the Congress he was committed
                            to working together toward a settlement in Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> asked whether

                            stressed the need for movement at this time and emphasized his
                            conviction that both Greek and Turkish Cypriots sincerely wanted a
                            solution, the main obstacle to which was the presence of Turkish troops.
                            He felt, and the President agreed, that through demilitarization of the
                            island the security of the Turkish Cypriots could be secured. Also,
                            because of the economic potential of the island, attractive financial
                            inducements could be offered to the Turkish Cypriots.</p>

                            said, would be to start with the 1960 Constitution, and see what
                            additional guarantees the Turks would require. The discussions reviewed
                            constitutional issues, geographic and demographic issues and a possible
                            Varosha settlement in some depth. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1"
                                >Nimetz</persName> also alluded to the missing persons issue and the

                        <p>7. Comment: President <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName>
                            was cordial, calm and genuinely constructive. He seemed to listen with

                            interjections which tended to be more positive and imaginative. One was
                            left with the feeling that the President does want to move toward a <pb

                        <p>Summary: Counselor <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> and
                            party met with <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> for one
                            hour September 6 and then continued discussions more informally with
                            enlarged Turkish Cypriot delegation at luncheon in Famagusta. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> was moderate and emphasized
                            willingness to sit down with Greek Cypriots at any time to discuss all
                            the issues. He offered no new mechanism for resuming talks, claiming
                            that he had made adequate offers, but was at least receptive to
                            suggestions that <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> might seek to draw
                            up agenda for fresh round of negotiations and that 1960 Constitution
                            could be modified to incorporate bizonality and federalism. While most
                            skeptical of <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName>’s proposal
                            for demilitarization, <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName>
                            displayed interest in concept of economic development fund to assist
                            Turkish Cypriots. He endorsed general idea of non-governmental dialogue,
                            but was suspicious of Greek Cypriot purposes in wanting this. Small,
                            non-violent demonstration took place outside Denktash’s residence during
                            meeting. End summary.</p>
                        <p>1. Upon arrival at Denktash’s residence, <persName corresp="#p_NM_1"
                                >Nimetz</persName> party was greeted by some 108 rightist
                            demonstrators bearing signs protesting <persName corresp="#p_NM_1"
                                >Nimetz</persName> visit and opposing any concessions to Greek
                            Cypriots, especially over Famagusta. Demonstration was peaceful if
                            noisy; chanting was clearly audible during private meeting with
                                <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName>.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> opened discussion by
                            clarifying procedures for lifting of Turkish embargo. Once President had
                            made required initial certification to Congress, embargo would be
                            removed unconditionally.<note n="2" xml:id="d58fn2">See <ref

                                facs="0235" xml:id="pg_202"/>was requirement for report to Congress
                            every sixty days, but no provision for re-imposition of embargo should
                            we be unable to demonstrate progress at each interval. Subsequent
                            requests to Congress for security assistance to Turkey and Greece would
                            be accompanied by statements justifying such aid in the light of <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> policy in the region; but this would
                            not have any effect on removal of embargo. Denktash appeared reassured
                            by this clarification, commenting that his concern over the embargo had
                            been in its effect in alienating Turkey from the West.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> stressed to <persName
                                corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> continued <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> interest in seeing solution to Cyprus
                            problem. Our concern was both humanitarian and based on realization that
                            Greek-Turkish relations could not be restored fully until problem was
                            resolved. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> explained that
                            purpose of current visit was to determine whether there were any
                            prospects for forward movement and to see how the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> could best be of assistance to the
                            parties. We would want to be in a position to be helpful should
                                <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> ask for our advice.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> noted that his talks
                            on the Greek Cypriot side had gone better than expected. The <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> did not harp on the withdrawal of
                            Turkish forces or the enforcement of <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                            resolutions. Rather, we encountered a promising mind-set in private
                            conversations, and indications that serious thought was being given to
                            the problem.</p>
                        <p>4. When <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> recounted what he
                            considered to be unrealistic demands on the other side, <persName
                                corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> stressed belief that there was
                            in fact basis for bargaining. The Greek Cypriots had now returned to the

                                corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> Guidelines, they accepted the
                            concept of federation, and basically, they were ready to agree to
                            bizonality. They appreciated, moreover, Turkish Cypriot concern over
                            security and were prepared to make arrangements to satisfy this.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> expressed belief that
                            there should be enough ground in common to work something out, but that
                            only way to accomplish anything was through negotiations. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> strongly concurred in the
                            latter point; the table was the place to make suggestions and
                            counter-suggestions.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> noted that there was a
                            substantial political problem for each side in initiating negotiations.
                            They could not accept the other’s proposals as a basis for talks, and
                            yet they could not simply sit down with no advance substantive
                            preparation. <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> interjected
                            that the <persName corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName>-<persName
                                corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> Guidelines afforded a
                            sufficient base for starting negotiations—why not discuss each other’s
                            interpretations of these? <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName>
                            accepted the notion of the Guidelines as a point of departure, but
                            emphasized that the groundwork would have to be laid before any
                            intercommunal sessions were held. Perhaps <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1"
                                >Waldheim</persName> or someone else could convoke preliminary
                            discussions on the subjects to be discussed, with the aim of
                            transforming the Guidelines into actual agenda items. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> noted again that the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> was not ready to negotiate in the
                            abstract, and that it was politically very difficult for them to sit
                            down with <pb n="203" facs="0236" xml:id="pg_203"/>the Turkish Cypriot

                            <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> maintained that the
                            Turkish Cypriots had put forward their “biggest bait” and it had been
                            rejected. He then recounted in some detail how Greek Cypriots had
                            consistently rejected in past any and all proposals put forward by
                            Turkish Cypriots. He underscored his readiness to discuss all issues,
                            but what could he do if the other side would not sit down?</p>
                        <p>6. Revision of 1960 Constitution. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1"
                                >Nimetz</persName> suggested that one negotiating path worth
                            exploring would be modification of the 1960 Constitution, in accordance
                            with the <persName corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName>-<persName
                                corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> Principles, to provide for a
                            bizonal federation in Cyprus. This would give resumed negotiations form
                            and substance, and would permit both sides to withdraw their own
                            proposals without facing the unpromising prospect of an open agenda.
                            Since the Greek Cypriots accepted both the 1960 Constitution and the
                                <persName corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName>-<persName
                                corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> guidelines, this might well
                            represent an acceptable face-saving device for them. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> explained that the 1960
                            Constitution had attempted to bridge what were quite opposite political
                            aims on the part of the two Cypriot communities. Perhaps a more
                            effective system could have evolved in time, but the Greek Cypriots had
                            not allowed it to work. <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName>
                            noted, however, that the concept of the 1960 Constitution was embodied
                            in the April 13 proposals; he sought only to introduce the concepts of
                            federalism and bizonality.</p>
                        <p>7. Return of refugees. <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName>
                            argued that Greek Cypriot insistence that all refugees return to their
                            homes amounted to undermining the concept of bizonality. He asserted
                            that the Turkish Cypriots could not be dislocated once again, and that
                            the only way to remove causes of friction was to allow the peoples of
                            each community to live by themselves. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1"
                                >Nimetz</persName> expressed his belief that the Greek Cypriots were
                            realistic on this issue; they would insist that a certain number of
                            refugees be allowed to return to their homes, but for practical purposes
                            they envisaged the Turkish zone as overwhelmingly Turkish in population.
                            This was a matter that would have to be resolved through quiet
                            negotiations between the two sides. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1"
                                >Nimetz</persName> underscored the political difficulties for the
                            Greek Cypriots if they did not espouse the refugee cause; on the other
                            hand, if the interest of the refugees could be stimulated, they could
                            act as a useful pressure on the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> as
                            they had over Varosha. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName>
                            pointed out to <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> that
                            legislation lifting embargo referred to return of refugees and not
                            return of all refugees.<note n="4" xml:id="d58fn4">Presidential

                                included the following provision on the refugee issue in Cyprus:
                                “That the Government of Turkey is acting in good faith to achieve a
                                just and peaceful settlement of the Cyprus problem, the early
                                peaceable return of refugees to their homes and properties, and
                                continued removal of Turkish military troops from Cyprus in the
                                context of a solution to the Cyprus problem, and the early serious
                                resumption of intercommunal talks aimed at a just, negotiated
                                settlement.” See <ref target="#d121">Document 121</ref>.</note>
                        </p>

                        <p>8. Demilitarization and security. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1"
                                >Nimetz</persName> said that he had found on the Greek Cypriot side
                            an appreciation for Turkish Cypriot security concerns. They wanted to
                            satisfy these concerns, and believed that Kyprianou’s demilitarization
                            proposal could accomplish this.<note n="5" xml:id="d58fn5">See <ref
                                    target="#d54">Document 54</ref>.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> was most skeptical. He
                            described how, after the failure to form a Cypriot army in the early
                            1960’s, the Greek Cypriots had formed their own armed groups and had
                            attacked the Turkish minority. On the basis of past experience,
                            demilitarization meant that the Turks would be without arms while Greeks
                            armed secretly. <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> said
                            that some form of disarmament could perhaps be arranged in the form of a
                            renunciation of large weapons? But there would need to be sufficient
                            forces on the island for the foreseeable future to back up settlement
                            guarantees.</p>
                        <p>9. Economic assistance. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName>
                            said that the Greek Cypriots had also expressed an understanding of the
                            economic difficulties of the Turkish Cypriots and had indicated their
                            readiness to extend some form of economic assistance in the event of a
                            settlement. He reminded <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName>
                            that in his statement before the <gloss target="#t_HIRC_1">HIRC</gloss>
                            on April 6 Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> had
                            stated we might request additional funds from the Congress in the event
                            of a settlement to ease the process of readjustment.<note n="6"
                                xml:id="d58fn6">For <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>’s

                                    <hi rend="italic">Bulletin,</hi> May 1978, pp. 33–35.</note> It
                            was our hope, <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> said, that a
                            larger proportion of this aid could be channeled to the Turkish Cypriot
                            side. The Greeks seemed to feel, however, that outside assistance would
                            not be required, that the island had sufficient potential as a center
                            for tourism and Middle Eastern economic activity to provide for the
                            needs of both sides. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName>
                            expressed his belief that some economic package beneficial to the
                            Turkish side could be developed, and that negotiations on the subject
                            could usefully be held in parallel with constitutional and territorial
                            talks. Perhaps a joint fund could be established to finance projects in
                            the north.</p>
                        <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> freely admitted that
                            the Turkish Cypriots had severe economic problems. While he emphasized
                            that outside assistance was needed right now, he nevertheless maintained
                            that a development fund established simultaneously with a political
                            settlement would be a good idea if it came without political strings. In
                            this context, <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> brought up
                            the economic “boycott” against the north, charging that the Greek
                            Cypriots were the ones creating barriers and calling on them to lift the
                            “boycott” as a gesture of goodwill. The <gloss target="#t_GOC_1"
                                >GOC</gloss> was opposed to reopening Nicosia Airport because this
                            would weaken the “boycott”. When <persName corresp="#p_NM_1"
                                >Nimetz</persName> asked whether reopening the airport solely for
                                <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> use <pb n="205" facs="0238"
                                xml:id="pg_205"/>would be any easier, <persName corresp="#p_DR_1"
                                >Denktash</persName> declared that this would only reinforce the
                            “boycott” in that the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> would continue
                            to refuse to utilize Ercan.</p>
                        <p>11. <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> aspects. In response to <persName
                                corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> query, <persName
                                corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> said that it was our impression
                            that the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> had not yet decided on a
                            plan of action at the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> this fall. We
                            had told them that any resort to the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                            in a manner offensive to the other side would cause difficulties as far
                            as resuming negotiations were concerned, and we felt that they
                            appreciated this. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName>
                            encouraged <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> to work with

                                corresp="#p_GPR_1">Pohl</persName> as a means of resolving concrete
                            problems such as Varosha and missing persons and of moving to a
                            resumption of full talks. <persName corresp="#p_DR_1"
                                >Denktash</persName> said that he believes <persName
                                corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> had a significant role to
                            play in a settlement, that he could make it a success. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> added that we believed <persName
                                corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> and his associates could be
                            usefully involved in preparing at least an agenda for the next round of
                            talks.</p>
                        <p>12. Contacts between the communities. While endorsing general concept of
                            instituting dialogue with Greek Cypriots in non-governmental channels,
                                <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> was chary of Greek
                            Cypriot intentions in wanting to enter into such contacts. He felt that
                            the purpose might be to demonstrate to the world that Cypriots of both
                            communities could get along together, and that the Cyprus dispute was
                            essentially one between Cyprus and Turkey. He interpreted the proposed
                                <persName corresp="#p_CI_2">Chrysostomos</persName>-Mufti meeting in

                            conversations with President <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d59fn2">See <ref

                                >55</ref>. The report referred to by <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                    >Carter</persName> was not found.</note> “We share your interest
                            in bringing peace and basic human rights to Cypriots. As you know, we
                            have a longstanding interest in trying to solve issues on Cyprus and I
                            hope that we can make progress in the near future,” the President
                            continued. “Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> has
                            told me that you are prepared to begin negotiations with Mr. Denktaş. We
                            hope that this could be on a continuing basis. One of the things we have
                            learned the hard way in dealing with the Israelis and the Egyptians is
                            that spasmodic meetings are completely fruitless and can even cause a
                            deterioration of the relationship because so much energy is spent in
                            trying to get people to meet and in the intervening periods both sides
                            concentrate on analyzing their reasons for disagreement and do not want
                            to meet again. I hope that it will now be possible for negotiations to
                            begin on the basis that you described to Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>. We are glad to offer our good
                            offices but the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> should be the primary
                            group to whom you turn for arrangements. We want to be helpful without
                            interfering,” the President concluded.</p>
                        <p>In replying, <hi rend="italic">President <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                    >Kyprianou</persName>
                            </hi>, after thanking the President for receiving him and recalling
                            their last meeting with pleasure, said he <pb n="207" facs="0240"
                                xml:id="pg_207"/>had always felt it would be more constructive for
                            him to meet with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                >Ecevit</persName> than with Mr. Denktaş but he recognized that
                                <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> did not want to meet
                            with him. Thus he came to the conclusion that he should meet with
                            Denktaş, provided that “certain things are agreed beforehand.” “Just
                            meeting and saying that we have failed will create more difficulties for
                            everybody,” he declared. He went on to say that many people in Cyprus
                            opposed his meeting with Denktaş because Denktaş was regarded as
                            committed to partition since 1954, i.e. an extremist. Other Turkish
                            Cypriot leaders, <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> said,
                            were more moderate but because of the presence of Turkish troops could
                            not express themselves. Thus he was willing to meet Denktaş on condition
                            that nothing become known until there was agreement on the basis of
                            which they could continue negotiations. The concrete step could be the
                            return of the Greek part of Famagusta, he said. Once this was done talks
                            could continue on three conditions: (1) that <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss> resolutions, especially #3212, be recognized as
                                valid;<note n="3" xml:id="d59fn3">Resolution 3212 was adopted by the
                                General Assembly on November 1, 1974. In calling for the validity of
                                the resolution, <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> was
                                likely referring to its first provision calling on “all States to
                                respect the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity, and
                                non-alignment of the Republic of Cyprus and to refrain from all acts
                                and interventions directed against it.” (<hi rend="italic">Yearbook

                            replaced by anything else, would be recognized; and (3) that the four
                            guiding principles which were agreed upon between Archbishop <persName
                                corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName> and Mr. Denktaş be considered
                                valid.<note n="4" xml:id="d59fn4">See <ref target="#d31fn5">footnote
                                    5, Document 31</ref>.</note> Within the framework of these three
                            conditions, President <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName>
                            said, “A more specific framework for a solution to the Cyprus problem
                            could be developed.” He added that he agreed that negotiations that took
                            place every six months could not lead to anything: “We should sit down
                            for days and try to break the deadlock. I have to admit that with
                            Denktaş it will be more difficult than it would be with <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>.” He said that their information
                            indicated that the vast majority of Turkish Cypriots were eager for a
                            settlement: “They live under conditions of misery; they have no work;
                            they do not know what to do; they want to emigrate; they are not happy
                            with the Turkish troops; they are not happy with the settlers brought
                            from Turkey to change the demographic character of Cyprus.”</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">President <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                    >Kyprianou</persName>
                            </hi> reiterated his willingness to try negotiations with Denktaş but
                            maintained there must be pressure on Denktaş from Ankara. “With all due
                            respect, I believe your influence should be exercised in the direction
                            of Ankara—they should change radically their attitude if we are going to
                            achieve a solution—if we are going to approach the Cyprus problem in its
                            complexity we will never solve it; it <pb n="208" facs="0241"
                                xml:id="pg_208"/>must be approached in its simplicity.” He
                            complained that Cyprus could not negotiate on an equal basis with
                            Turkey, but said that if the Turks were to agree to withdraw their
                            troops from Cyprus and let them be replaced with an international police
                            force, in which the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> could
                            participate, then the Turkish Cypriots would be free to express their
                            views. “I am sure that reconciliation would then be very easy. I am sure
                            that past experience has taught both Greek and Turkish Cypriots that
                            happiness lies in unity. If this does not happen, Cyprus will be a
                            permanent source of friction between Greeks and Turks.” He concluded by
                            saying that they had decided again to raise the Cyprus problem in the

                            had assured him that Denktaş was willing to withdraw from Varosha. “I
                            believe they will comply with this commitment,” the President added. The
                            exact delineation of the withdrawal lines would have to be worked out,
                            he noted. Until a settlement was achieved, however, the President said
                            he thought it unrealistic to expect the Turks to withdraw all their
                            troops from Cyprus. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1"
                                >Christopher</persName> said the Turkish position was that they
                            would withdraw their troops when a settlement had been reached except
                            for troops that would be provided in the settlement agreement itself.
                            The Turks were committed to drawing new boundaries between the Turkish
                            and Greek communities in Cyprus, he added. The President asked about the
                            boundaries of Varosha. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1"
                                >Christopher</persName> said he assumed they could be agreed on and
                            President <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> replied that
                            they would have to be worked out. He said there were differences between
                            Greeks and Turks on the number of inhabitants thought to want to return
                            to Varosha. They calculated 32,000 according to 1973 statistics, who
                            could return now, but the Turks had been talking of 36,000. Some people
                            might not want to return, he said, unless everyone returned. <hi

                            parties. President <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> said
                            that he had told Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>
                            that there must be a firm commitment on the part of the Turks for the
                            withdrawal of Turkish troops from Cyprus.</p>

                            promise to us: They had told us they would continue withdrawing troops
                            and they had; they had notified us each time they planned to do so—“and
                            our intelligence has indicated that they have done what they have told
                            us they were going to do,” the President declared. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> said he expected the Turks
                            to go on withdrawing troops in the course of negotiations. <hi

                            </hi> came back to his earlier assertion: if it would be possible to
                            withdraw all Turkish troops and have an independent force replace them,
                            then settlement would be easier.</p>

                        <p>“I agree that would be easier,” <hi rend="italic">President <persName

                            </hi> said, “but I do not think that it is accurate to anticipate that
                            the Turks are going to withdraw their troops unilaterally. There is
                            distrust on both sides and we would like to remove it.” “It is obvious
                            to me after long talks with <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                >Ecevit</persName> that they would like to see this situation solved
                            and they are willing to be much more flexible than I had observed a year
                            ago,” the President declared, noting that other commitments made it
                            necessary for him to bring the meeting to an end. He accompanied
                            President <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> and his party

                            lead to anything productive. The US believes the only answer is for the

                            Turkey as with the Ambassador’s government. He said that the US
                            certainly will help where it can and will offer its good offices, <pb

                            not work. He said that the sides must get their talks going, define
                            problems and issues and in so doing bring matters to a point where other
                            countries such as the US can use their influence on specific
                            points—rather than to make broad overtures generally condemning one side
                            or the other. He continued that only in this way can the US help to
                            break the barrier between the Turks and the Government of Cyprus. He
                            emphasized again the need to get a sustained discussion going first, and
                            reiterated that commitments in advance or pre-conditions simply will not
                            work. The application of US pressure in such circumstances is similar to

                            concessions before talks. He added that the Greek-Cypriots are not
                            negotiating from weakness. He observed that there is a great deal of
                            pressure on the Turkish to do the right thing, but they do not have to
                            do it if the Greek-Cypriots will not even start talking. The Turks are
                            prepared to start talking and if the Greek-Cypriots want an agreement,
                            then they must start talking.</p>

                            accounted for Greek-Cypriot reservations about further talks. He said
                            that they need some indication of what the Turks are prepared to do on
                            Cyprus, even if such indications are behind the scenes. He concluded
                            that another round of talks ending in stalemate would only aggravate the

                            about the prospects for such talks are negative. He suggested that there
                            is too wide a gap between the parties now for progress and that
                            exploratory talks are needed. The Ambassador continued that the Allies
                            have been unwilling to press Turkey in this regard.</p>

                            about. He repeated that pre-conditions never work and there will not be
                            progress under such circumstances. He allowed that perhaps the State

                                facs="0246" xml:id="pg_213"/>then again emphasized that the only

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">The Ambassador</hi> said that his government is not
                            against negotiating, but that there were differences of approach. There
                            once had been three obstacles to progress: (1) the question of union
                            with Greece—which is no longer an issue; (2) sovereignty on the basis of
                            federation—which his government has accepted as long as it is not a
                            sham; and (3) opposition to a bizonal federation—which his government
                            has accepted in principle (although there are differences with respect
                            to territory and constitution). He said that as a result of these
                            changes in his government’s position the situation was now better than
                            before. Nevertheless, the Turks continue to persist on 32.8 percent of
                            the island while his government calls for 18 percent. He noted that the
                            official government records prove that Turkish ownership before the 1975
                            conflict and occupation was about 12 percent. He concluded that all
                            these things give the impression that the Turks do not want to
                            negotiate, that their attitude is negative and that they do not want a
                            solution. Six rounds of talks have been frustrating. He continued that
                            if the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Secretary General felt that
                            further talks would be useful he would have called for them.</p>

                            that the US is cautious.</p>

                            progress. But if the US jumps into the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss> debate to satisfy the pride of the Cypriot government,
                            how does that advance the negotiations? Thus, the US probably will be

                                would serve as a “valid point of departure.” Once the Greek Cypriots

                                present the paper to the negotiators from their respective

                                59, Central Foreign Policy File, D780462–0291) The “non-paper”
                                outlined a conceptual framework to address the disputed issues on
                                Cyprus, including the following provisions: a “bicommunal federal
                                state with two constituent regions,” each of which would be
                                inhabited primarily by Greek Cypriots in one region and Turkish
                                Cypriots in the other; a new constitutional structure and a
                                government system consisting of a central authority as well as
                                regional institutions; and the withdrawal of non-Cypriot armed

                            specific comments on each paragraph. Neither of the Cypriots raised any
                            immediate objections to particular features of the paper, and seemed
                            quite pleased at the territorial formula and at the provisions for
                            resettlement of Varosha. They undertook to study it very carefully, to
                            discuss it with President <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName>, and to be in touch with us again very

                            very closely.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_MA_2">Michaelides</persName> said that the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> had been giving considerable
                            thought as to the level and working procedures of future intercommunal
                            negotiations. If indeed the two sides were able to return to the table,
                            the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> would want to negotiate on a
                            serious and sustained basis and he—<persName corresp="#p_MA_2"
                                >Michaelides</persName>—would probably be the chief negotiator,
                            assisted by a moderately-sized team. However, this would be possible
                            only if the Turkish Cypriots were also prepared to appoint a higher
                            level negotiator. <persName corresp="#p_MA_2">Michaelides</persName>
                            agreed with <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> that for the
                            sake of efficiency and speed negotiating sub-groups could be formed to
                            discuss territory, specific constitutional aspects, return of displaced
                            persons, etc.</p>
                        <p>3. The <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> request for a Security
                            Council meeting on the Cyprus issue was discussed at some length. Both
                                <persName corresp="#p_MA_2">Michaelides</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName> characterized resort to the
                            Council as an unfortunate necessity, and explained it principally in
                            terms of domestic political needs. They averred that they were
                            interested in having only a brief session which would adopt a resolution
                            reaffirming previous <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_UNSC_1">UNSC</gloss> resolutions on Cyprus and would
                            request the Secretary-General to report to the Council within a
                            specified time on the progress achieved in implementing these
                            resolutions. <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName> explained
                            further that the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> intent was to
                            extract the political content from the semi-annual debate and resolution
                            on renewal of the <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP_1">UNFICYP</gloss> mandate,
                            so that this essentially procedural step could be taken in the future
                            without the kind of difficulties that were experienced last June. There
                            would then be semi-annual <gloss target="#t_SYG_1">SYG</gloss> reports
                            (and presumably <gloss target="#t_SC_1">SC</gloss> meetings) on the
                            implementation of U.N. resolutions; and separate semi-annual reports on
                                <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP_1">UNFICYP</gloss> operations.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> noted that we had all
                            along considered recourse to the Security Council to be unnecessary and
                            possibly detrimental to the prospects for negotiation. However, since
                            the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> seemed determined to go
                            ahead—and <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName> confirmed
                            that this was so—our aim would be to get the debate over as quickly as
                            possible and to ensure that whatever resolution was passed would
                            contribute to a resumption of negotiations. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1"
                                >Nimetz</persName> said that we would be prepared to work with the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> and others to develop a
                            resolution that achieved these ends. In light of the Varosha <gloss

                                <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Security Council Resolution 414
                                was adopted on September 15, 1977, after a complaint by the Cypriot
                                Government concerning the Turkish plan to re-colonize Varosha in the
                                Turkish-occupied part of Cyprus. The resolution called on both
                                parties to refrain from unilateral actions and to resume
                                negotiations.</note> we were genuinely concerned that Security
                            Council consideration of the issue could drag on <pb n="216" facs="0249"
                                xml:id="pg_216"/>for several weeks—with possibly serious
                            consequences. <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName>
                            hypothesized that if both sides were prepared to accept the non-paper
                            immediately, then <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> could
                            perhaps be asked early next week to request the parties to postpone
                            Security Council consideration of the Cyprus item on the grounds that
                            his contacts with the parties were bearing fruit and that he was now
                            prepared to put some specific ideas before them. This would give the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> a way to back out gracefully.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MA_2">Michaelides</persName> was somewhat
                            dubious about such a scheme, noting that it would give rise to much
                            speculation in Cyprus and might not satisfy public opinion. While on
                            this theme, <persName corresp="#p_MA_2">Michaelides</persName> noted

                            Cyprus non-paper. <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> was
                            accompanied by New York Rep <persName corresp="#p_AN_1"

                            <persName corresp="#p_TI_1">Turkmen</persName> was also present. By way
                            of introductory remarks <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName>
                            drew on the general points in para 2, State 284952, emphasizing that the
                            non-paper did not constitute an “American plan,” that we were asking the
                            two Cypriot parties to accept it only as a basis for further
                            intercommunal negotiations, and that its existence and the present
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> role should remain strictly
                            confidential. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> also
                            stressed our belief that a just and durable solution to the Cyprus
                            problem could be achieved only through free, direct negotiations between
                            representatives of the two communities, and that the role of outsiders
                            should be confined solely to stimulating a resumption of this
                            process.</p>
                        <p>6. After a cursory reading of the non-paper, Denktash said that he could
                            only comment as Sir Winston Churchill reportedly did upon hearing of a
                            military catastrophe—“Is that so? Fetch me a scotch-and-water.” This was
                            no more than the Greek Cypriot position artfully camouflaged; he could
                            not envisage <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> having any
                            difficulty with a single sentence. He was particularly worried at
                            mention of the 1960 Constitution, which he had repeatedly said was
                            unacceptable to the Turkish Cypriot side as a basis for negotiation.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> said that his
                            existing authority from the “<gloss target="#t_TFSC_1">TFSC</gloss>”
                            Assembly was to work for a bizonal, bicommunal federal system within the
                                <persName corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName>-<persName
                                corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName>
                            <pb n="217" facs="0250" xml:id="pg_217"/>Guidelines. Since he was now
                            being asked to accept a non-paper that represented an amalgamation of
                            the Guidelines and the 1960 Constitution, he would accordingly be
                            obliged to consult with <persName corresp="#p_OO_2">Orek</persName>, the
                            Cabinet and the Assembly before he could provide us with a response.
                            Such wide-ranging consultations would make it near-impossible to
                            maintain the necessary secrecy. He predicted that, in any case, the
                            Greek Cypriots would leak the paper very quickly.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> said that the non-paper
                            represented no more than an extension and elaboration of the basic
                                <persName corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName>-<persName
                                corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> instructions, and was in no
                            way incompatible with them. He recalled that <persName corresp="#p_DR_1"
                                >Denktash</persName> himself had previously acknowledged that
                            elements of the old constitution could be effectively utilized in
                            drawing up the new. Since the whole power structure would be very
                            different in the future, the Turkish Cypriots should have no fear that
                            they would be denied basic rights and privileges embodied in the 1960
                            document. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> then went
                            through the non-paper with <persName corresp="#p_DR_1"
                                >Denktash</persName> in detail, drawing on the points in para 3,
                            State 284952, and demonstrating that essential Turkish Cypriot interests
                            were safeguarded at each and every juncture.<note n="5" xml:id="d61fn5"

                                that the United States expected both the Greek Cypriots and Turkish
                                Cypriots to commit to sustained and earnest negotiations, and that
                                the framework allowed the Turkish Cypriots “a significant voice in

                            provision of the paper. Aside from complaining that the constitutional
                            court system established in 1960 had never worked, <persName
                                corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> offered no further specific
                            comments on the paper. However, he undertook to give it “real thought”
                            and to be back in touch with us. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1"
                                >Nimetz</persName> said that we had received the impression that the
                            Greek Cypriots were genuinely interested in negotiating seriously and on
                            a continuous basis towards a settlement. They were giving serious
                            consideration to appointing <persName corresp="#p_MA_2"
                                >Michaelides</persName> as chief interlocutor, if this elevation of
                            the negotiating level were matched on the Turkish Cypriot side.</p>
                        <p>8. In ensuing discussion of the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>
                            request for <gloss target="#t_UNSC_1">UNSC</gloss> consideration of the
                            Cyprus issue, <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> said that
                            the Greek Cypriots had told us they were interested in having only a
                            brief Council session and that they had their sights on what they saw as
                            a mild resolution. For our part, we would like to see <gloss
                                target="#t_UNSC_1">UNSC</gloss> consideration of the issue finished
                            as quickly as possible, and our strategy would be geared towards
                            encouraging a resumption of the intercommunal talks—or at least
                            preventing the erection of any further obstacles to this. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName>, clearly dispirited at the
                            twin “blows” of the <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss> outcome and
                            the upcoming <gloss target="#t_SC_1">SC</gloss> debate, said that his
                            chief preoccupation was to get the whole business <pb n="218"
                                facs="0251" xml:id="pg_218"/>finished quickly so that he could
                            return to Cyprus. He was afraid, however, that the Greek Cypriots would
                            try to drag things out indefinitely. <persName corresp="#p_DR_1"
                                >Denktash</persName> added that the harsh <gloss target="#t_GA_1"

                            Council were hardly indicative of a readiness on the Greek Cypriot part
                            to enter into serious face-to-face negotiations.<note n="6"

                            also present. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> took note of
                            the several approaches that had been made in New York and elsewhere that
                            day, and commented briefly on the initial reactions of <persName
                                corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_MA_2">Michaelides</persName> and of <persName
                                corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName>. He said that our purpose had
                            not been to put forward a paper that both sides would endorse with
                            enthusiasm, but simply one that they would agree to accept as a basis
                            for resumed intercommunal negotiations under U.N. auspices. Once both
                            parties had indicated their acceptance we would communicate this to the
                            Secretary General, in the hope that he would then convoke a meeting
                            between <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> and <persName

                                >Nimetz</persName> noted that we had had to overcome resistance from
                            both sides in undertaking this effort. The Turks had repeatedly told us
                            they wanted no outside initiative and had expressed the belief that
                                <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> would come around
                            if given time and less attention; the Greek Cypriots, for their part,
                            had wanted us to delay until after the <gloss target="#t_UNSC_1"
                                >UNSC</gloss> meeting on Cyprus was over. We had told the Turks that
                            their approach was simply inadequate and that some positive effort was
                            needed if there were to be negotiations; and with the Greek Cypriots we
                            had insisted that we could wait no longer.</p>
                        <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> said that he would

                                >Denktash</persName> meeting, under this scenario, so as to reach
                            agreement on the basic framework for negotiation. While noting that much
                            work remained to be done, he endorsed our basic approach to the problem.
                                <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> sketched the
                            difficulties he faced in convening negotiations unless he was assured
                            that something positive would result from them. Last spring he had taken
                            the Turkish Cypriot proposals to Nicosia and had met with a wall of
                            resistance from <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName>, who
                            had privately told him that he would not send a delegation even if the
                            Secretary General called for a new round of talks. <persName
                                corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> said that he could not have
                            risked so outright a Greek Cypriot rebuff. However, now that the Turkish
                            arms embargo debate was over there would seem to be no valid reason for
                                <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> to resist a further
                            effort to restart the intercommunal negotiations, and he surely could
                            not object to a face-to-face meeting with <persName corresp="#p_DR_1"
                                >Denktash</persName> if only because <persName corresp="#p_M3_1"

                            said that Greek Cypriot plans to raise the level of their negotiator—if
                            this was matched on the Turkish Cypriot side—seemed to indicate that
                            they were serious about entering into a sustained and productive
                            dialogue. <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> noted that he
                            had also been told by the Greek Cypriots that <persName
                                corresp="#p_MA_2">Michaelides</persName> might be the new
                            negotiator, and recalled that he had on several occasions in the past
                            encouraged both sides to raise the level of their interlocutors. He
                            added that he could not personally be present while intercommunal
                            negotiations were in progress, but would leave someone else in
                            charge.</p>
                        <p>11. <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> read through the
                            paper quickly, with <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName>
                            commenting on certain of the more important provisions. The Secretary
                            General said that some of the ideas incorporated into it, such as the
                            Agency for Regional Cooperation and Coordination, sounded familiar. The
                            area of Varosha to be opened for resettlement was in fact quite similar
                            to that he had himself suggested at one time. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> commented generally that the
                            non-paper was an expansion of the <persName corresp="#p_M3_1"
                                >Makarios</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName>
                            Guidelines, a restatement at the next level of specificity. It was a
                            balanced document that did not prejudice the position of either side,
                            and it was our intention to press for its integral acceptance without
                            engaging in pre-negotiations.</p>
                        <p>12. <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> expressed the hope
                            that the upcoming Security Council consideration of the Cyprus issue
                            would not disrupt this initiative. He noted that he had twice sought to
                            discourage <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName> from having
                            recourse to the Council. On the first occasion, <persName
                                corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName> had seemed to agree that this
                            would be unwise, but then he had come back to say that a formal decision
                            had been taken in Cyprus and that public opinion there expected some
                            Security Council action. Further approaches would no doubt meet with the
                            same response, and did not therefore seem worthwhile. <persName
                                corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> noted that much would depend
                            on the nature of the resolution the Greek Cypriots were able to obtain,
                            although given the Security Council configuration this could not but be
                            a relatively mild one. In response to the Secretary General’s query as
                            to the timing of further moves, <persName corresp="#p_NM_1"
                                >Nimetz</persName> estimated that it might take the parties perhaps
                            a week or two to reach a decision on the non-paper. We had urged them to
                            move quickly, but at the same time to analyze the non-paper with due
                            care. While agreeing that we should not wait too long, <persName
                                corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> expressed doubt as to whether
                            a resumption of negotiations would be practically possible before next
                            January or February, with the <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP_1"
                                >UNFICYP</gloss> renewal debate in the Security Council and the
                            Christmas holidays coming up very soon.</p>
                        <p>13. <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> assured us that he
                            would hold the non-paper in the strictest confidence: only he, <persName
                                corresp="#p_UB_1">Urquhart</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_SGL_1">Sherry</persName> would know about it. In
                            concluding the meeting, he urged that we continue to stress to both
                            parties that this effort is aimed at no more than bringing about a <pb
                                n="220" facs="0253" xml:id="pg_220"/>resumption of talks in the
                            established intercommunal forum. The Turkish side, as we were no doubt
                            well aware, was very concerned that our plan was to abandon this
                            framework in favor of a more direct <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            role.</p>
                        <p>14. In a separate conversation, <persName corresp="#p_SGL_1"
                                >Sherry</persName> confirmed that the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1"
                                >GOC</gloss> intent in the Security Council was to request a
                            resolution recalling previous <gloss target="#t_GA_1">GA</gloss> and
                                <gloss target="#t_SC_1">SC</gloss> resolutions and asking that the
                            Secretary General report to the Council twice a year on progress made in
                            their implementation. <persName corresp="#p_UB_1">Urquhart</persName>
                            and <persName corresp="#p_SGL_1">Sherry</persName> both emphasized that
                            such a requirement for periodic reports would make sustained and serious
                            negotiations very difficult.</p>
                        <p>15. Comment: <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> is already
                            required to report to the Security Council twice a year in connection
                            with semi-annual renewals of <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP_1"
                                >UNFICYP</gloss>. We do not rpt not believe requiring second series
                            of reports by <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> would
                            have effect of de-politicizing <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP_1"
                                >UNFICYP</gloss> debate, as <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1"
                                >Rolandis</persName> claimed. To the contrary, probable result would
                            be four <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> reports a year
                            and four Security Council meetings, in which inevitable polemics could
                            adversely affect chances for successful negotiations—Greek Cypriots
                            probably want to use these meetings to keep the pressure upon the
                            Turks.</p>

                            and correct those elements in the paper which are unacceptable to the

                        <p>1. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] in
                            mid-November 1978, Cypriot President <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Spyros
                                Kyprianou</persName> gave his views on the paper presented to the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> by the American Government
                            containing a suggested framework for a settlement to the Cyprus problem.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> said that based on
                            his initial reading and study of the paper, he believed that the
                            American Government was serious in attempting to bring about a
                            settlement to the Cyprus problem. He said, however, that he could not
                            accept the paper in its present form as a basis on which to resume
                            intercommunal negotiations. <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName> added that, pending discussion of the paper
                            with the government ministers and with party leaders in the National
                            Council, his present intention is to prepare a set of “counterproposals”
                            which would address those issues in the present paper which are
                            unacceptable to the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> identified as follows
                            those areas of the paper which troubled him:</p>
                        <p>A. While the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> accepts the principle
                            that “the northern region of Cyprus” will be predominantly Turkish,
                                <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> said that this
                            conflicts with later provisions in the paper dealing with the return of
                            refugees to their homes. <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName> said that the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1"
                                >GOC</gloss> must be in a position to state unequivocally that “all”
                            refugees will be “allowed” to return. The implication in the paper that
                            some refugees may be “unable” to return (i.e., not permitted to return)
                            is unacceptable as a basic element in any proposal which could lead to
                            the resumption of intercommunal talks. <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName> accepts that many refugees indeed may choose
                            not to return to their former homes and properties, but stated that the
                            present paper must be clarified to eliminate the implication that some
                            would not be permitted to return. <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName> said that he accepted fully the concept that
                            those Cypriots who chose to return to the Turkish area would fall under
                            local Turkish administration. This concept would remain valid even
                            should a sizable number of Greek Cypriots choose to return to a given
                            area. Should this happen in the north, the effective result would be, in
                            such areas, a Greek Cypriot majority living under the administration of
                            a Turkish minority. This particular area then would not technically be
                            “predominantly Turkish.” <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName> acknowledged that this would undoubtedly
                            inhibit many Greek Cypriots from exer<pb n="222" facs="0255"
                                xml:id="pg_222"/>cising their right to return. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> also said that Turkish
                            Cypriots currently living in Greek Cypriot properties in the north to
                            which Greek Cypriots wanted to return should be resettled at government
                            expense on government lands closely adjacent to the locations they
                            presently inhabit.</p>
                        <p>B. <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> said that he accepted
                            the American paper’s formulation that the <persName corresp="#p_M3_1"
                                >Makarios</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName>
                            Guidelines, the 1960 Cyprus Constitution and relevant United Nations’
                            resolutions should provide the framework for a negotiated settlement. He
                            said, however, that he could not accept the order and emphasis given
                            these elements in the present paper. Consequently, he tentatively plans
                            to suggest that this portion of the paper be restructed to give primary
                            emphasis to the United Nations’ resolutions.</p>
                        <p>C. <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> said that while he
                            would not object to the bicameral proposals in the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> paper, he felt that as currently
                            formulated they would not provide sufficient importance and weight to
                            the role of the Greek Cypriot community. For instance, the provision
                            that three eighths of the Turkish Cypriot members of the lower House
                            must participate in a vote to make it binding left open a very real
                            possibility of deadlock in the deliberations of legislature. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> said he plans to ask that
                            these points be clarified and that the Greek Cypriot role be
                            strengthened.</p>
                        <p>D. Regarding the provisions for President and Vice President of the
                            Republic, <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> said he felt
                            that, under present formulation, the Turkish side would insist that the
                            Presidency alternate between Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot
                            incumbents. <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> described
                            this as a most important point because the Greek Cypriots could never
                            accept a Turkish Cypriot president. <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName> said that he would seek to have this point
                            explicitly clarified.</p>
                        <p>E. <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> said that he had some
                            problems with the concept of a thirty percent proportional
                            representation for Turkish Cypriots in the assignment of Ministerial
                            portfolios in the Federal Government, but felt these problems could be
                            resolved through negotiations. Ratification of Ministerial appointments
                            by the upper House was satisfactory to <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName> as long as the correct proportional balance is
                            maintained.</p>
                        <p>F. With regard to the proposed Agency for Reconstruction, <persName
                                corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> said that it would be
                            difficult for him to accept equal representation between the Greek and
                            Turkish Cypriot communities in this body.</p>
                        <p>G. <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> said that he felt
                            strongly about the issue of Famagusta and intended to hold out for the
                            return to Greek Cypriot control of the entire area populated by the
                            Greek Cypriots prior to 1974. <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName> said that this specifically included the rural
                            areas west of Varosha and its suburbs.</p>
                        <pb n="223" facs="0256" xml:id="pg_223"/>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> said that he intends
                            to begin work on formulating clarification and counterproposals to the
                            American paper as soon as the senior Cypriot officials and party leaders
                            now in New York had returned to Nicosia. <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName> said that the public <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> role in these proposals must be minimized and the
                            U.N., specifically Secretary General <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Kurt
                                Waldheim</persName>, should be directly and actively involved.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> said that he is
                            considering three separate approaches to the situation. One is a public
                            call for the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides to submit new, concrete
                            proposals for the resumption of the talks. The second alternative would
                            be a meeting between himself and the Turkish Cypriot leader <persName
                                corresp="#p_DR_1">Rauf Denktash</persName> to submit their own
                            clarifications and counterproposals to the American framework. The third
                            alternative being considered by <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName> would be to initiate a series of contacts with
                            the Turkish Cypriot side on a level lower than that of President.
                            Specifically, he has considered delegating this task to Minister to the
                            President Georgios Ioannidis. <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName> said that, at present, he tends to favor the
                            latter approach, but might revise his views in light of upcoming
                            consultations with government and party leaders.</p>
                        <p>5. In conclusion, <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> said
                            that he has no intention of rejecting the American paper. On the other
                            hand, the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> will not accept the paper
                            without reservations because, in his view, acceptance of the plan in its
                            present form would lead to partition of the island.</p>

                            to <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> along these lines.
                                <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> also noted that the

                            developments and to ask whether the Nine could be of any help. <persName
                                corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> had said that it would be
                            useful if the Nine could express to the Turkish side their concern over
                            any attempt to rewrite his formulation.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> said that it seemed as
                            if we had made definite progress now towards a resumption of
                            intercommunal talks, although admittedly new problems had arisen with
                            the <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> counterproposal.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> then briefed the

                            had further commentary from the Turkish Foreign Ministry on the
                                <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> counterproposal, and
                            had been told that the Turkish side would not insist on certain of their
                            changes—in particular insertion of the word “bizonal”. It was our
                            feeling, <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> said, that the
                            Turkish Cypriots would accept the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                            paper if some minor changes were made. Basically this was a
                            psychological matter for the Turkish side: the paper, which they assumed
                            had been coordinated with the Greek Cypriots, had been sent to them for
                            their comments and suggestions, and they probably felt a need to provide
                            some input.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> said that he was
                            encouraged to hear what <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>
                            had told <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> regarding
                            the intentions of the Turkish side. This seemed to paint quite a
                            different picture from what the <persName corresp="#p_DR_1"
                                >Denktash</persName> counterproposal as such had implied. He said
                            that the best course now would be for the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss> to prepare a fresh version of the formulation taking
                            into account some of the Turkish Cypriot suggestions. He felt that it
                            would be best to do this as quickly as possible. <persName
                                corresp="#p_UB_1">Urquhart</persName> pointed out that Rolandis had

                                >Waldheim</persName> acknowledged this but emphasized that he had
                            previously made clear to <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1"
                                >Rolandis</persName> that the paper as submitted on December 19–20
                            was not to be considered a final text but would have to await the
                            comments from the other side. As far as the substance of the Turkish
                            Cypriot suggestions was concerned, <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1"
                                >Waldheim</persName> said he believed it would be much easier to
                            arrange a “political truce” between the parties than to bring an end to
                            the “economic blockade”.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> told <persName

                            prepared to make approaches in Ankara and Nicosia in support of
                                <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName>’s revised <pb
                                n="226" facs="0259" xml:id="pg_226"/>paper, if he thought this would
                            be helpful. <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> said he
                            would appreciate this. The two agreed that the basic concept would be to
                            make a few changes so that <persName corresp="#p_DR_1"
                                >Denktash</persName> could say that his ideas had been taken into
                            account in the paper, while the other side could maintain that the
                            changes were minor. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> said
                            that we had prepared some suggested revisions which we would be happy to
                            pass on on an informal basis. He stressed that these were purely a US
                            product and had not been coordinated with our British and Canadian
                            partners.</p>

                                >Waldheim</persName> said that he was encouraged at recent
                            developments and felt that a resumption of negotiations could shortly

                                    >Waldheim</persName> noted that Turkey was less inclined toward
                                flexibility on Cyprus since its leaders believed that the revolution
                                in Iran had strengthened Ankara’s standing in the region.

                                <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> paper. He expressed a strong
                            preference for the original text but at the same time asked that if
                            amendments were to be proposed that this be done strictly in private.

                            paper which he had earlier promised, and had indicated that he was not
                            setting conditions for the resumption of talks. He said that all he had
                            done was to express his views on the draft paper as had been requested
                            of him, in the expectation that his views would be given careful
                            consideration. <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName>
                            complimented the Secretary General for making a constructive approach

                            and <persName corresp="#p_UB_1">Urquhart</persName> agreed that these
                            reports were encouraging and that the way seemed clear for the <gloss

                            be tactically useful for the Secretary General to suggest to the parties
                            a tentative date for a <pb n="227" facs="0260" xml:id="pg_227"/>

                            this would be a good idea but noted that he would have to consult with
                            the Secretary General on this matter. It might be possible for some

                        <p>3. Summary. Current U.N. efforts appear to have run their course without
                            effective results. Any mediation effort, however, to be acceptable to
                                <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> must be under aegis <gloss

                            <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> be urged to appoint
                            proven negotiator such as <persName corresp="#p_UB_1"

                        <p>4. Based on my conversations with Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots
                            alike, there seems to be clear consensus that recent effort of <gloss
                                target="#t_SYG_1">SYG</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName>, through <gloss

                            <persName corresp="#p_GPR_1">Galindo Pohl</persName>, to reach agreement
                            on agenda for resumption intercommunal talks is getting nowhere and has,
                            in fact, come to the end of the road. Pleasant and capable as <persName
                                corresp="#p_GPR_1">Galindo Pohl</persName> is, he has not been able
                            to show much initiative and effectively press both sides to arrive at an
                            agreed agenda. In fact, his function has been largely that of messenger
                            between <gloss target="#t_SYG_1">SYG</gloss> and two sides. There are
                            those who feel he has also been inhibited by his limited command of the
                            English language.</p>
                        <p>5. All Cypriots recognize essentiality and need for an effective mediator
                            who would be politically acceptable. Latter qualification boils down to
                            requirement that any mediator must be under U.N. auspices. This in turn,
                            means either personal involvement of <gloss target="#t_SecGen_1"
                                >SecGen</gloss> or appointment of recognized mediator—though this
                            term is unacceptable to Turkish side—of international standing. Such an
                            individual could be supported by <persName corresp="#p_GPR_1">Galindo
                                Pohl</persName> in his efforts. I understand precedent for such a

                            lead to Cyprus solution. As Dept. aware, many Cypriots regret rejection
                            Anglo-American-Canadian plan as basis for resumption negotiations and
                            certainly feel that way should be found to resurrect that plan in the
                            context of resumption intercommunal talks.<note n="4" xml:id="d64fn4"

                            atmosphere than political steps. Over time they could contribute more to

                            <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> told the Deputy
                            Secretary and the Counselor April 11 that as a result of consultations
                            last week with <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_AK_1">Atakol</persName>, he will propose the

                                >Denktash</persName> summit in Nicosia probably May 16–18. He hopes
                            to utilize the summit to obtain their agreement to a scaled-down agenda
                            as the basis for early resumption of intercommunal negotiations. In
                            preparation for the summit he will send <gloss target="#t_USYG_1"

                            <persName corresp="#p_DCJP_1">Perez de Cuellar</persName> to Nicosia
                            later this month to work with the parties. <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1"
                                >Christopher</persName> urged <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1"
                                >Waldheim</persName> to seek agreement at the summit on a specific
                            date for resumption of intercommunal negotiations. The <gloss

                            Ankara and Nicosia. End summary.</p>

                                >Sherry</persName> in the Secretary-General’s office at the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> on April 11 at 1700 to discuss the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>’s Cyprus initiative. In reply to
                                <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName>’s query as to
                            the outcome of his meetings with <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1"
                                >Rolandis</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_AK_1"
                                >Atakol</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName>
                            said that both of them had indicated that they wanted him to convene a
                            summit even without an agenda agreed upon in advance. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName> had telephoned him April 10
                            from Salonika to confirm <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> agreement
                            to convening the summit. Rather than seeking to hold the summit later
                            this month as <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName> had
                            suggested, <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> instead will
                            propose to the parties that he convene it in Nicosia on or about May
                            16–18 upon returning from his Asian trip. In order to assure adequate
                            preparations, he intends to dispatch <gloss target="#t_USYG_1"
                                >USYG</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DCJP_1">Perez de Cuellar</persName> to Nicosia
                            next week to conduct further preliminary consultations with the
                            parties.</p>
                        <p>4. At their meeting in Geneva, <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1"
                                >Waldheim</persName> said, <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1"
                                >Rolandis</persName> had indicated that the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1"
                                >GOC</gloss> hoped the summit could produce agreement on an agenda
                            for resumption of intercommunal negotiations. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName> outlined three possible
                            scenarios for the results of the summit: (a) full <pb n="231"
                                facs="0264" xml:id="pg_231"/>agreement on an agenda; (b) failure
                            with no agreement at all; and (c) an interim situation in which the
                                <gloss target="#t_SYG_1">SYG</gloss> could announce that agreement
                            had been reached on certain elements of an agenda while other points
                            remained to be worked out. In this last case, the parties would ask
                                <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> to continue his
                            efforts to resolve the remaining differences. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> told <persName
                                corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> that we hope he will be able
                            to obtain the agreement of the parties to a specific early date for
                            resumption of intercommunal negotiations, rather than end up with the
                            inconclusive result outlined by <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1"
                                >Rolandis</persName> in option c, or worse yet, with a complete
                            breakdown.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> said that he agreed
                            with the Deputy <gloss target="#t_Secy_1">Secy</gloss>. on the
                            desirability of reaching agreement on an agenda, even if it is
                            significantly scaled-down from the ones which the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> had already proposed as well as from the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> non-paper. The key problems, he
                            said, remain the need to obtain some assurances from the Turkish side
                            regarding Varosha and from the Cypriot side regarding easing of the
                            economic blockade and political warfare in a manner which each side can
                            explain credibly to its own political institutions and public
                            opinion.</p>
                        <p>6. Reviewing his Zurich discussion, <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1"
                                >Waldheim</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_AK_1"
                                >Atakol</persName> insisted that the Turkish Cypriots are prepared
                            to have Varosha considered only as part of a package settlement. This
                            departs from the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>’s understanding of
                                <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName>’s July 20, 1978 open
                            message. The present Turkish Cypriot position as <persName
                                corresp="#p_AK_1">Atakol</persName> had explained it to him is that
                            they will not agree to any preliminary resolution of the Varosha issue,
                            nor will they allow any refugees to return before progress has been made
                            on other issues. The <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> and the Turkish
                            Cypriots continue to disagree on the extent of the area of resettlement
                            envisaged in the open message. Nonetheless, <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1"
                                >Waldheim</persName> said he was encouraged by <persName
                                corresp="#p_AK_1">Atakol</persName>’s indication of willingness to
                            have him convene a summit even without a pre-agreed agenda in order to
                            try to cut the Gordian Knot. He recalled the positive results of the
                                <persName corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName>/<persName
                                corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> summit which had produced the
                            four Guidelines.<note n="2" xml:id="d65fn2">See <ref target="#d31fn5"
                                    >footnote 5, Document 31</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>7. As regards the Cypriot position, <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1"
                                >Waldheim</persName> said he had urged <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1"
                                >Rolandis</persName> to seek <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>
                            agreement to have the economic blockade included as a subject for
                            discussion on the agenda of intercommunal negotiations. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName> had adamantly refused stating
                            that it was impossible for the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>,
                            after the Turks had stolen their orchards, to make it possible for them
                            to sell this produce abroad. <persName corresp="#p_UB_1"
                                >Urquhart</persName> suggested that one way to overcome this problem
                            could be for the <gloss target="#t_SYG_1">SYG</gloss> at the summit to
                            suggest ways of improving the economic and social situation on the
                            island without referring specifically to the blockade. <persName
                                corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> added <pb n="232" facs="0265"
                                xml:id="pg_232"/>that he hoped there would be some movement on this
                            issue at the summit, despite the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>’s
                            very tough position.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> expressed
                            appreciation to <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> for his
                            efforts and decision to convene a summit. The <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss>, he said, would give him its full support and we were
                            prepared to make supporting demarches in Ankara and Nicosia. Our
                            impression, he continued, was that a confluence of events at this
                            particular time made it more likely than earlier that the two sides
                            would be prepared to show flexibility. Supporters of Greece in the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Congress had conveyed to
                            Nicosia their impression that the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>’s
                            negative approach to the US/UK/Canadian proposal and in negotiations
                            with the <gloss target="#t_SYG_1">SYG</gloss> was not in its best
                            interest. The <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> government
                            for its part may be more eager to lighten its responsibilities for
                            Cyprus in view of its pressing economic and social problems. We believe,
                            he continued, that the Turkish side could be persuaded to go back to
                                <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName>’s original position
                            of July 20 on Varosha if the Cypriots agree to make some tangible
                            concessions on the economic and political warfare issues. As regards the
                            Cypriots, it is our impression that <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1"
                                >Rolandis</persName> wants to be helpful. Moreover, it may be
                            possible for <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName> to
                            encourage <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> to show
                            greater flexibility. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName>
                            observed that <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> had
                            considerable leverage with both sides at this particular time. They are
                            very much aware that he must prepare his report to the Security Council
                            by May 31 and neither will want to be blamed by him for intransigence or
                            lack of political will.</p>
                        <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_UB_1">Urquhart</persName> asked for further
                            clarification of our assessment of the current <gloss target="#t_GOT_1"
                                >GOT</gloss> attitude toward the Cyprus question. The chairman of
                            the Cypriot House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee,
                                <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Alexis Ghalanos</persName>, had
                            suggested to him this week that the Turkish domestic situation was so
                            bad that Cyprus was no longer a priority issue in internal politics.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Ghalanos</persName> thought this could
                            make it easier for <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> to
                            demonstrate flexibility. <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1"
                                >Christopher</persName> replied that there was perhaps some validity
                            to <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Ghalanos</persName>’ assessment, but on

                        <p>2. This telegram concerns ongoing efforts directed at a Cyprus
                            solution.</p>
                        <p>3. Summary. I called on President <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName> morning April 30 and carried out instructions
                            reftel. The President asked me to inform my government that he is
                            sincerely interested in finding common ground for a resumption of the
                            intercommunal talks. End summary.</p>
                        <p>4. I met with President <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName>
                            for approximately twenty minutes morning April 30 and carried out
                            instructions para 14 reftel. As regards advance preparations for the
                            meeting, the President said he did not wish to agree beforehand on what
                            would be said in a communique following the meeting before the meeting
                            had even been held. He impled that he considered this practice somewhat
                            dishonest and said that he wanted to deal with matters very clearly and
                            fairly.</p>
                        <p>5. Regarding the proposal that he meet alone with <persName
                                corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName>, the President said he had
                            mentioned this to President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                >Carter</persName> when he met with him last fall.<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d66fn3">See <ref target="#d59">Document 59</ref>.</note> His
                            objective in seeking such a private meeting was not to deal the <gloss
                                target="#t_SecGen_1">SecGen</gloss> out of participation but rather
                            to provide an opportunity for him and <persName corresp="#p_DR_1"
                                >Denktash</persName> to have a private conversation so that they
                            could say things to one another which would not be on the record. He did
                            not envisage that such a meeting would necessarily be a very lengthy
                            one.</p>
                        <p>6. When I made the point that we understood the <gloss
                                target="#t_SecGen_1">SecGen</gloss> might come to Cyprus only if he
                            received some assurances of a successful meeting, the President said he
                            disagreed with such an approach on the part of the <gloss
                                target="#t_SecGen_1">SecGen</gloss>. One couldn’t be certain that
                            the meeting would be <pb n="234" facs="0267" xml:id="pg_234"/>successful
                            even before it took place. The only way this could happen would be if
                            the <gloss target="#t_SecGen_1">SecGen</gloss> wanted <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCJP_1">Perez de Cuellar</persName> to do the job for
                            him and, if that were the case, it wouldn’t be necessary for the <gloss
                                target="#t_SecGen_1">SecGen</gloss> himself to participate. As
                            regards a mediator or a Security Council mediation panel, the President
                            said that, while he would have no objection to this approach, he assured
                            me he would not press it.</p>
                        <p>7. He said he wanted a thorough exploration of the issues with <persName
                                corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> and he was not interested in a
                            purely ceremonial meeting. Only after going into the substance of the
                            problem in depth did he feel it would be possible to make progress. He
                            asked me to assure my government that he intended to have a full
                            discussion with <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName>, that he
                            was very sincere in this effort, and that he was genuinely interested in
                            securing common ground for the resumption of the intercommunal
                            talks.</p>
                        <p>8. The President obviously regards the effort to agree to a communique
                            even before the meeting is held as a questionable practice, and told me
                            he felt he should not be expected to mislead either his own people or
                            the international community. One had to have the meeting first before
                            coming to agreement on the wording of a communique.</p>
                        <p>9. Just before leaving, I told him I had heard very good things about
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DCJP_1">de Cuellar</persName>, and he
                            indicated that he thinks very highly of him.</p>

                            both leaders that the international community was losing patience with
                            the stalemate and that the capacity of the United Nations to mediate the
                            conflict had a limit. (National Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1"

                            The Cypriot people know the American tradition of liberalism. They know

                            offered to bring the best wishes of the people of Cyprus. They rejoiced
                            over the President’s election. This is a tragic situation for the people
                            of Cyprus, who are submerged under Turkish occupation. He asks: what
                            will the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> do to help the situation.
                            The President has a religious mind, and believes in Christ. In the whole
                            Middle East, Christianity is in danger from the Moslems. Cyprus is the
                            only Middle East country where Christians are in the great majority. He
                            appeals to the President’s Christian conscience to act to help his
                            Christian brothers in Cyprus to regain their human rights. They ask only
                            freedom and justice. The approach of the United States to Cyprus’
                            problems is not what they expect. They know that Turkey depends on the

                                <persName corresp="#p_IG_1">Ioannides</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_OUS_1">Onan</persName> had served together as members of
                            the Assembly and were personally very cordial to one another. In the
                            case of <persName corresp="#p_TM_1">Triantafyllides</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_EN_3">Ertekun</persName>, he said they had
                            been close personal friends, a friendship which had equally been shared
                            by their wives. The one jarring personality, he said, was Soysal, whom
                            he described as cold and hard. He called him a Marxist who, he had been
                            told by a Turkish source, was practically a Communist. He <pb n="238"
                                facs="0271" xml:id="pg_238"/>asked if it would be possible for me to
                            provide him with some background information on Soysal. I told him I

                        <p>3. Action requested: I would much appreciate a frank appraisal of Soysal
                            and what makes him tick, which I could share with <persName

                                telegram 4781 from Ankara, June 22: “His concept of a Cyprus

                                the region, and he is convinced that the West cannot be sympathetic

                        </list>
                        <p>The Cyprus intercommunal talks resumed as scheduled on June 15, but major
                            difficulties soon arose over the agenda and the U.N. decided to call a
                            recess on June 22 rather than risk a complete breakdown of the
                            negotiations. Over the past month U.N. representatives in Cyprus have
                            held informal consultations with both sides in an effort to break this
                            deadlock, but their efforts have thus far proved unavailing.</p>
                        <p>The current dispute between the Cypriot parties is on the surface a
                            procedural one—whether the negotiations will commence with point two
                            (definitions) or point five (Varosha) of the Nicosia communique of <pb
                                n="239" facs="0272" xml:id="pg_239"/>May 19.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d70fn2">See <ref target="#d67">Document 67</ref>.</note> But
                            this disagreement reflects clear substantive differences as well as a
                            persistent mutual distrust between the parties. The Greek Cypriots want
                            to see Varosha opened to resettlement as quickly as possible both as a
                            test of Turkish good faith and as a means of assuring domestic support
                            for the negotiating track, while the Turkish Cypriots are concerned
                            about yielding Varosha without first having obtained a Greek Cypriot
                            commitment to the fundamentals (as defined by the Turkish Cypriots) of
                            an overall settlement. In recent meetings with U.N. representatives the
                            Greek Cypriots seem to have shown some flexibility, but thus far the
                            Turkish Cypriots have said that they cannot even discuss Varosha unless
                            they have some assurances as to the general shape of an overall
                            settlement.</p>
                        <p>The reasons for the Turkish Cypriot attitude are unclear. They may simply
                            be stalling, or it may be that they are genuinely concerned that the
                            Greek Cypriots’ intention is simply to take back Varosha and not
                            continue with serious negotiations on the principal constitutional and
                            territorial issues. The U.N. ascribes the Turkish Cypriots’ negativism
                            to the current political situation in Turkey. With a very precarious
                            hold on power and with elections due in October, Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>, they maintain, is in
                            no position to pressure the Turkish Cypriots into making
                            concessions.</p>
                        <p>With these questions in mind we approached the Turkish Government to
                            probe their intentions with respect to Cyprus. High-ranking Foreign
                            Ministry officials with whom we spoke stoutly defended the Turkish
                            Cypriot position, but at the same time assured us that the Turkish side
                            remains interested in a Cyprus settlement and gave indications that they
                            might be prepared to reach a compromise arrangement that would allow
                            talks to proceed on Varosha in exchange for certain Greek Cypriot
                            assurances. Our assessment is that, while the domestic political
                            situation indeed acts as a serious constraint, the Turks’ delaying
                            tactics are primarily prompted by substantive concerns over Greek
                            Cypriot intentions. This gives us some cause to hope that a formula can
                            be devised to resolve the present deadlock. But this will require an
                            intensified effort by the U.N., which plays the key mediatory role.</p>
                        <p>Indeed, one of the problems we have detected over the past week or so is
                            a waning in the U.N.’s interest in actively pursuing a resolution of the
                            deadlock. In an effort to reactivate the U.N. role, I raised the Cyprus
                            question with <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Kurt Waldheim</persName>

                                The Turks, according to him, now want to change the terms, have
                                ‘Bizonality’ clarified, and secure better provision for ‘security
                                arrangements.’ The Secretary-General stated his intention to pursue
                                the matter actively through his Special Representative. He commented
                                that Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>
                                doesn’t seem to want to get in too deeply prior to October elections
                                in Turkey.” (Carter Library, National Security Affairs, Brzezinski

                            prepared a review of the present state of the Cyprus negotiations, which
                            I am attaching. My personal views are the following:</p>
                        <pb n="241" facs="0274" xml:id="pg_241"/>
                        <p>—There is little reason to expect a resumption of productive Cyprus
                            intercommunal talks in the near term.</p>
                        <p>—The Cypriot Greeks will concentrate on the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss> forum through December. The Turks will be preoccupied
                            with elections, political and domestic issues in the coming months.</p>
                        <p>—As long as there is hope that <gloss target="#t_SYG_1">SYG</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> will bring the two
                            sides back to the conference table, we must back him fully.</p>
                        <p>—Based on our information, we cannot confirm the reports that <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> found the May 19 document
                            unacceptable and that he instructed the Turkish Cypriots to stall the
                            negotiations indefinitely.<note n="3" xml:id="d71fn3">See <ref

                        </p>
                        <p>—However, as noted above, <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>
                            is increasingly preoccupied with his own shaky political situation and
                            has less time for and interest in the Cyprus problem.</p>
                        <p>—As the November 30 deadline for the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_SYG_1">SYG</gloss> Cyprus report approaches, the two
                            Cypriot parties may, however, show some more flexibility vis-a-vis the
                                <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> good-offices effort
                            to avoid being blamed in the report for lack of progress.</p>

                                    negotiations because “both parties will continue to hold
                                    adamantly to fundamentally irreconcilable positions.”</note>
                            </p>
                            <p>We agree with <persName corresp="#p_SGL_1">Sherry</persName> that
                                there is little reason to expect a resumption of the Cyprus
                                intercommunal talks in the near term. The parties remain
                                fundamentally divided on the nature of a final settlement. They have
                                argued indirectly since June 22 over how to resume their direct
                                dialogue, but the makings of an agreement to negotiate are lacking.
                                Neither side is willing to give up its major trump—for the Greek
                                Cypriots, the lifting of the economic blockade; for the Turkish
                                Cypriots, the re<pb n="242" facs="0275" xml:id="pg_242"/>opening of
                                Varosha to resettlement—until the other makes prior concessions.
                                This approach effectively precludes a pragmatic approach to the many
                                aspects of the Cyprus problem. After more than a decade of fitful
                                starts and stops, the intercommunal talks have gone nowhere.</p>
                            <p>The Cypriot communities have no historical experience of successful
                                negotiation with each other. Outside powers imposed the
                                London-Zurich Accords on them in 1959.<note n="6" xml:id="d71fn6"
                                    >See <ref target="#d8fn3">footnote 3, Document 8</ref>.</note>
                                Between independence and late 1963, the two communities frustrated
                                each other, thus making the Accords unworkable. Between 1964 and
                                1967, the Greek Cypriots dominated the Turkish Cypriots. Between
                                1968 and mid-1974, the intercommunal talks made no progress because
                                the Turkish side was too weak and the Greek side too demanding.
                                Since 1974, the Turkish side has pressed its advantage and the Greek
                                side has been under no effective inducement to yield.</p>
                            <p>It sometimes appears that the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> is
                                the only government which truly wants a successful negotiation of
                                the Cyprus problem. Since 1963, we have submitted more plans and
                                devoted more time to this problem than have all other outside
                                powers. Unable to bring about a negotiated settlement, we have
                                sought as a policy goal to establish and to maintain a process of
                                intercommunal negotiation, in order to meet our minimal
                                requirements. Unfortunately, our leverage has been insufficient to
                                alter the posture of either party to the Cyprus dispute.</p>
                            <p>At present, we see no alternative to continued support of <persName
                                    corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName>’s good-offices effort.
                                That effort brought about the May 19 <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                    >Kyprianou</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_DR_1"
                                    >Denktash</persName> agreement—the only significant point on
                                which the two sides have agreed in the past 30 months. So long as
                                there is hope that <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName>
                                will bring the two sides back to the conference table, we must back
                                him fully. Specifically, we must continue to argue for resumption of
                                the talks on the basis of the May 19 agreement, a document which
                                incorporates by reference the 1977 <persName corresp="#p_M3_1"
                                    >Makarios</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_DR_1"
                                    >Denktash</persName> guidelines and the pertinent <gloss
                                    target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> resolutions. We shall be considering
                                what steps we might take if this effort fails, but we see no reason
                                for us to get out in front of <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1"
                                    >Waldheim</persName> until the fate of his initiative is
                                known.</p>
                            <p>We disagree with <persName corresp="#p_SGL_1">Sherry</persName>’s
                                evaluation that <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>
                                decided to scotch the talks after May 19, or that he found the May
                                19 document unacceptable. <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                    >Ecevit</persName> is preoccupied with his own shaky political
                                position and elections in October. However, acceding to the May 19
                                agreement cost him little, if anything, in Turkey. We do not see how
                                resumption of the talks would hurt him prior to the elections next
                                month. The reality on the Turkish side is probably more subtle—i.e.,
                                to the extent that <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>
                                dwells increasingly on his domestic predicament, he has less time
                                for <pb n="243" facs="0276" xml:id="pg_243"/>the Cyprus problem
                                which thus falls prey to the inflexibility of the Turkish
                                bureaucracy. On the other hand, there is reason to believe that,
                                after hearing <persName corresp="#p_SSJ_1">Solarz</persName>’s frank
                                review of the situation in Congress, <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                    >Ecevit</persName> recently directed the <gloss

                            <p>The calendar offers further reason not to expect a near-term
                                resumption of the talks. We are now in the annual season of

                                    The conference communiqué, dated August 7, called for a
                                    resolution of the Cyprus conflict along lines that could be
                                    interpreted as favoring the Greek Cypriot side. The communiqué
                                    called for the implementation of <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                        >UN</gloss> Security Council Resolution 355 (1974), which
                                    called for the territorial integrity and non-alignment of Cyprus
                                    and the removal of foreign troops from the island. (<hi

                                    ongoing occupation of northern Cyprus by the Turkish military.
                                    Speaking as host of the Nonaligned Movement summit of 1979, held
                                    in Havana, Cuban President Fidel Castro addressed the <gloss

                                    during which he also criticized the occupation of Cyprus by
                                    foreign troops.</note> It will certainly seek a strong Cyprus
                                resolution in the <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss>, and
                                possibly also in the <gloss target="#t_UNSC_1">UNSC</gloss>. This
                                pursuit gives the other side, in Ankara and in Nicosia, an excuse
                                for its own posturing and temporizing.</p>
                            <p>There are two rays of hope on this rather gloomy horizon. First, the
                                    <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> may soon conduct an effective
                                “informal consultation” between the two sides, either in New York or
                                in Nicosia. Second, the <gloss target="#t_UNSYG_1">UNSYG</gloss>
                                must send his Cyprus report to the Security Council by November 30.
                                Neither side wants to be cited in that document as the reason for
                                the lack of progress in the intercommunal talks. There is thus a
                                chance that, as the November 30 date approaches, the two parties
                                will agree to certain minimal steps that could enable the <persName

                        <p>3. Summary: Discreet soundings indicate that the Turkish Cypriot
                            “government” is likely to avoid a unilateral declaration of independence
                                (<gloss target="#t_UDI_1">UDI</gloss>), despite political weakness
                            in Ankara. As <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> internationalization
                            of the Cyprus problem continues, Turkish Cypriots are becoming
                            increasingly resigned to regularizing and expanding what they generally
                            regard as their already independent status as the only credible
                            alternative to their present ambiguous position. However, most envisage
                            gradual progress toward a recognized independence grounded on expanding
                            economic self-sufficiency, and would oppose any abrupt move that would
                            jeopardize existing, painfully won economic relations with Europe and
                            the Middle East. <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> may
                            well use Greek Cypriot excesses during the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss> debates as a pretext for a carefully measured political
                            move toward a greater degree of independence. We now judge, however,
                            that he will stop far short of <gloss target="#t_UDI_1">UDI</gloss>,
                            except in the unlikely event that sanctions are approved by the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>. End summary.</p>
                        <p>4. With Senate elections likely to produce a government crisis in Ankara,
                            it appeared possible that a resulting relaxation in Ankara’s control
                            over Turkish Cypriot affairs would give “President” <persName
                                corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> greater scope to move toward
                            seeking recognition of the independence of Turkish Cyprus (<gloss
                                target="#t_reftel_1">reftel</gloss>). Over the past few days we have
                            explored this possibility with Turkish Cypriot contacts. Although we
                            avoided direct approaches to the question, which might be
                            misinterpreted, we gained a much improved understanding of their
                            attitudes toward independence.</p>
                        <p>5. While many if not most Turkish Cypriots continue to view a bizonal
                            federal concept as an ideal solution of the Cyprus problem, increasing
                            numbers, including interlocutor <persName corresp="#p_OUS_1"
                                >Onan</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DR_1"
                            >Denktash</persName>’s economic advisor <persName corresp="#p_TR_1"
                                >Tatar</persName>, are beginning privately to express a loss of
                            faith in this ideal and to discuss the need for fuller independence.
                            Their confi<pb n="245" facs="0278" xml:id="pg_245"/>dence in the
                            potential for a negotiated settlement has been seriously eroded by
                            continued Greek Cypriot internationalization of the Cyprus problem on
                            the heels of what they regard as Greek Cypriot intransigence in
                            intercommunal talks. They feel that internationalization demonstrates
                            the absence of any genuine Greek Cypriot desire for a settlement that
                            will take into account the interests of both sides.</p>
                        <p>6. This does not mean, however, that Turkish Cypriots—other than a few
                            extreme rightists—favor immediate <gloss target="#t_UDI_1">UDI</gloss>.
                            Instead, most favor building a sound economy as a foundation for
                            eventual political independence. Even working level contacts in the
                                “<gloss target="#t_MFA_1">MFA</gloss>” gave priority to increasing
                            export and tourism revenues, which they fear would drop if a dramatic
                            move toward independence brought world disapproval, let alone formal
                                <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> sanctions. “Finance Minister”
                            Hakki Atun fully appreciates, for example, that a separate currency,
                            essential to full independence, cannot be established until the economy
                            is on a firmer footing. (Institution of a separate currency would of
                            course be a significant signal to the Greek Cypriots of the reality of
                            Turkish Cypriot independence, while at the same time freeing the Turkish
                            Cypriots from dependence on the troubled Turkish lira.) These and other
                            contacts believe that recognition by other states and representation in
                            international forums will follow eventually, at least in part as a
                            result of expanding trade relations. Also, much faith has been placed in
                            the Islamic community and efforts continue to be made to find Islamic
                            sources of finance and loan guarantees. They see no reason to jeopardize
                            the possibility of developing such relations or what most perceive to be
                            growing prosperity, only to achieve equal footing with Greek Cypriots in
                            the war of words that they are already resigned to losing.</p>
                        <p>7. The threat of seeking international recognition for what “President”
                                <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> describes as their
                            already independent state is one of the few elements of bargaining
                            leverage that Turkish Cypriots possess. In public statements “President”
                                <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> implies that <gloss
                                target="#t_UDI_1">UDI</gloss>, or at least a more recognizable
                            degree of independence, will be a necessary reaction to continued <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> internationalization of the Cyprus
                            problem. Privately, he advocates <gloss target="#t_UDI_1">UDI</gloss>
                            explicitly as a means of promoting a federal solution by putting the two
                            sides on an equal footing. His “government” occasionally takes measures
                            to expand Turkish Cypriot independence in reaction to <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> moves seen as unfavorable to the
                            Turkish Cypriot position. The decision to require the use of “<gloss
                                target="#t_TFSC_1">TFSC</gloss>” postage stamps by Greek Cypriots
                            living in the “<gloss target="#t_TFSC_1">TFSC</gloss>”, in reaction to a
                                <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> move at the UPU Congress to ban
                                “<gloss target="#t_TFSC_1">TFSC</gloss>” stamps, is the most recent
                                example.<note n="3" xml:id="d72fn3">Reference is to the Universal

                            />on acceptable terms or complete and viable independence can best be
                            answered by pointing out that the two possibilities are complementary.
                            Both are acceptable to the Turkish Cypriots and neither need be
                            sacrificed until the other is in sight.</p>
                        <p>8. Possible moves which <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName>
                            may take, should he decide that the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>
                            has badly overplayed its hand at the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>,
                            include announcement of recognition by another country, probably Muslim
                            if there are any takers, or dropping the word “federated” from “Turkish
                            Federated State of Cyprus”. The latter subtlety would present the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> with a de jure confirmation of the
                            present de facto situation. Either move, to have practical effect, would
                            have to receive at least tacit acceptance from Western countries which
                            perceive that the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> has obtained an
                            unnecessarily harsh Cyprus resolution in the <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1"
                                >UNGA</gloss>. On the basis of our recent explorations, we believe
                            that <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> will not repeat not
                            opt for <gloss target="#t_UDI_1">UDI</gloss>. The situation would be
                            drastically altered should the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> adopt
                            sanctions, since the Turkish Cypriots would no longer have anything to
                            lose in declaring <gloss target="#t_UDI_1">UDI</gloss>. We are not sure
                            the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> realizes this, but it appears
                            to have given up on sanctions this year as unattainable.</p>
                        <p>9. Whatever emerges from this year’s <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                            consideration of Cyprus, the Turkish Cypriots will continue to develop
                            more complete independence for their state unless or until the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> offers serious, credible proposals for
                            a federal solution that adequately protect, in Turkish Cypriot eyes, the
                            interests of the Turkish Cypriots. For reasons rooted in its own
                            internal politics, the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> is likely to
                            remain incapable of moving in this direction for the foreseeable

                            you that we gave full and earnest consideration to the proposals for a
                            committee, and I ask you to reconsider your position in light of the
                            conclusions we reached.</p>
                        <p>4. Cyprus and the United States have a common interest in seeking a just
                            and lasting settlement to the Cyprus question. We share the view that
                            only serious negotiations in the intercommunal talks can achieve that
                            goal; we also believe that the current mediation effort of U.N.
                            Secretary-General <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName>
                            offers the best prospect for moving in that direction. At the same time,
                            the United States wants to avoid any measure which could undermine the
                            Secretary-General’s efforts to bring about a resumption of the
                            intercommunal talks.</p>
                        <p>5. With these considerations in mind, we have analyzed the proposals for
                            creating a U.N. committee on Cyprus. In all candor, we have regretfully
                            concluded that a committee, whatever its makeup and mandate, would not
                            bring the Cyprus question closer to resolution. On the contrary, we
                            believe it could raise new issues of controversy and discord. In the
                            interest of our broader, mutual goal of finding a just and lasting
                            settlement of the Cyprus problem, I hope you will review your support of
                            a committee.</p>
                        <p>6. Let me raise a second, related consideration. We have followed with
                            great interest the efforts by the Secretary-General and his staff to
                            resume the intercommunal talks. We continue fully to support those
                            efforts. I ask you, Mr. President, to respond favorably to the
                            Secretary-General’s ideas, in the hope that this step will lead to a
                            meaningful dialogue with the Turkish Cypriots on the major elements of
                            the Cyprus problem. I strongly believe that the prospect of success,
                            however modest, makes it worthwhile for your government to take a step
                            which <pb n="248" facs="0281" xml:id="pg_248"/>has virtually no risk,
                            and possibly great benefit, for the people of Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>7. Whatever the outcome of the General Assembly debate on Cyprus, the
                            United States will continue to seek a prompt resumption of the talks. We
                            regard the basis of those talks as the May 19 communique between Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> and yourself, the
                                <persName corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName>-<persName
                                corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> Guidelines of 1977, and the
                            relevant U.N. resolutions. We shall continue to make our views known to
                            all parties, whenever such action seems useful or promises a good
                            result.</p>
                        <p>8. Throughout the long course of the Cyprus problem, there have been
                            those who see only difficulties and adduce reasons why something cannot
                            be done. I have always regarded you, Mr. President, as a man of more
                            creative vision based on hard experience. Great problems call forth acts
                            of great statesmanship, and I am confident that your government will
                            continue to strive to meet that high standard.</p>
                        <p>9. I enjoyed very much our recent talks in New York. I look forward to
                            staying in close touch with you in the weeks ahead, and I hope that you
                            will communicate with me at any time through Ambassador <persName

                        <p>3. Begin text. “I have read very carefully the message that you sent me
                            through your Ambassador in Nicosia, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SGL_2"

                        <p>4. I honestly cannot agree with the arguments put forward against our
                            proposal for the setting up of a committee. I am of the opinion that the
                            committee we are seeking from the General Assembly will greatly assist
                            in creating better prospects for promoting a solution on the Cyprus
                            problem. It will create a new momentum. It will fascilitate (sic) the
                            task for the Secretary-General rather than frustrating his efforts. We
                            do not envisage that the committee should substitute the
                            Secretary-General. On the contrary, it will strengthen his hand, if he
                            so wishes. I believe that with the setting up of this committee better
                            prospects will be created even in the direction of the resumption of the
                            talks, irrespective of the negative attitude that the Turks are taking
                            today towards the proposal for such a committee.</p>
                        <p>5. Five years have elapsed since the invasion of Cyprus by the Turkish
                            Army. Talks have been going on for the last five years to no avail. We
                            have repeatedly put forward concrete proposals which were rejected by
                            the Turkish side without even being discussed. During these long years
                            when we had to face the displacement of over two hundred thousand
                            people, the loss of home and property, the tragedy of the orphane (sic)
                            families and the drama of the missing persons, nothing concrete has been
                            done for the promotion of a solution to the Cyprus problem. We were
                            faced instead by a completely negative attitude of Turkey. I would like
                            to remind you that when the embargo was about to be lifted we were told
                            that once it was lifted there was going to be a very substantial change
                            in the attitude of Turkey favoring a just and lasting settlement to the
                            Cyprus problem.<note n="3" xml:id="d74fn3">See <ref target="#d50"
                                    >Document 50</ref>.</note> Nothing to that effect has happened,
                            however. The embargo was lifted, but, unfortunately the Turkish policy
                            towards Cyprus has hardened even more.</p>
                        <p>6. As I told you on many occasions and during our recent meetings in New
                            York, we have concluded an agreement between Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> and myself on the 19th of May,
                            1979, and we were ready and willing to commence negotiations on the
                            basis of that agreement. In fact, talks commenced on the 15th June, but,
                            owing to the attempt of the Turkish side to introduce new elements
                            outside the agreement, those talks were very short lived. The Turkish
                            side left us no alternative than to go to the General Assembly this year
                            with new more practical proposals which will, in our opinion, prove to
                            be helpful and constructive. This is the reason we have asked you to
                            support the creation of such a committee. <pb n="250" facs="0283"
                                xml:id="pg_250"/>I feel that it will really be a very positive step
                            forward. Concerning your reference to the talks, I would like to welcome
                            your statement that you will continue to seek prompt resumption of the
                            talks on the basis of the 19th of May Agreement, which includes also the

                            the talks; but the Turkish side by putting forward conditions for their
                            resumption and by seeking to exploit some ideas unofficially put forward
                            last August by the Secretary-General,<note n="4" xml:id="d74fn4">For

                            formal proposals and which were used by the Turkish side to bring to the
                            foreground once more unacceptable conditions. As I said before, we have
                            the 19th of May Agreement, which is very clear and very comprehensive
                            and which in our opinion contains all the substantive elements which
                            could form the basis for an agreement. We cannot accept any
                            preconditions or considerations for the resumption of the talks.</p>
                        <p>8. Cyprus and its people, Mr. Secretary of State, has suffered very much
                            during the past five years from the Turkish occupation, from the
                            continuous denial by the Turkish side to our people of the basic human
                            rights, from the perpetual violation of universally accepted principles,
                            from the continuous putting into effect of new measures by the so called
                            Turkish Cypriot Administration to bring closer partition and eventual
                            annexation of the occupied part of Cyprus to Turkey. We feel very
                            strongly that Cyprus is entitled to a better treatment by the United
                            Nations and by its friends, particularly by the United States which is
                            particularly sensitive for the safeguard of human rights and the
                            principles of freedom, justice and democracy.</p>
                        <p>9. We reasonably expect the approval of a committee as we are proposing
                            together with a stronger resolution from the General Assembly on the
                            Cyprus problem, so that, at last, there can be some step towards the
                            implementation of the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> resolutions
                            which have been adopted since 1974. It is only in this way and with the
                            withdrawal of foreign troops and with the return of the refugees to
                            their homes in safety that we can hope to create a new Cyprus fully
                            independent, sovereign, united, territorially integral, enjoying no more
                            rights than any other free country member of the United Nations.<note

                            a new momentum to be created. And we are convinced that the United

                                >Rolandis</persName> called on Secretary <persName

                                corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName> was accompanied by Cyprus
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JA_1">Jacovides</persName> and <gloss

                                corresp="#p_DCE_1">Dillery</persName> (notetaker) also sat in.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName> met separately with
                                <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> following Secretary’s
                            meeting.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName> opened the
                            conversation. He reported that he had met UNSG <persName
                                corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> February 4 and felt it was
                            also expedient to meet the Secretary. He appreciated that Turkey is more
                            important than Cyprus for the United States. However, he felt that if
                            the Cyprus problem could be solved Greek-Turkish relations could be
                            improved and <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and Western interests
                            in the Eastern Mediterranean would be promoted. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName> said his job is made
                            difficult by the fact that while Cyprus has basically a pro-Western
                            society, support for the Cyprus position in world forums comes from
                            other directions. It was this situation that caused Cyprus to abstain in
                            the <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss> on the vote condemning the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> for its action in

                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName> said <persName
                                corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> hopes to have the talks start
                            in March. He is considering a formula under which there would be three
                                <pb n="252" facs="0285" xml:id="pg_252"/>packages of four sessions
                            of the negotiations. Each of the main subjects would be considered in
                            each package: Varosha, goodwill measures, constitution, and territory.
                            Each 4-day package would be followed by a period of 10 days for study
                            and behind-the-scenes negotiation. <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1"
                                >Rolandis</persName> said he had accepted this concept. However, he
                            believed that problems are never solved in plenary and that neither side
                            will yield at the beginning of any discussions. Thus, it is important to
                            do some preparatory work.</p>
                        <p>5. The <gloss target="#t_FonMin_1">FonMin</gloss> continued that it is a
                            requirement for the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> that the
                            Varosha issue be solved at the beginning of negotiations. He recognized
                            that the Turkish Cypriots could not give Varosha up without some
                            compensatory action at the beginning of the talks. General thinking had
                            been that political concessions would be required to achieve this. The
                                <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> cannot make such
                            concessions.</p>
                        <p>6. In an effort to solve this problem, <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1"
                                >Rolandis</persName> said he had identified three possibilities: (1)
                            the two sides might try to negotiate the reopening of Nicosia
                                Airport;<note n="3" xml:id="d75fn3">The airport had been closed
                                since August 16, 1974.</note> (2) the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1"
                                >GOC</gloss> could offer aid to the Turkish Cypriots to help the
                            difficult economic situation in the north; (3) there could be joint
                            ventures under United Nations organizations such as improvement of the
                            electricity system, road development, telephone, etc. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName> thought the most practical of
                            these ideas was the prospect of <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> aid
                            for the Turkish Cypriots. Some of this could be in foreign exchange.
                            This would be along the line of the part of the May 19 Agreement that
                            calls for measures to display goodwill. It would also have a long term
                            positive effect of reducing the differences in per capita <gloss
                                target="#t_GNP_1">GNP</gloss> that now exist between the two
                            communities.</p>
                        <p>7. The Secretary asked how difficult it would be to reopen Nicosia
                            Airport. <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName> replied it
                            would be very difficult; questions of equality of staffing and passports
                            would arise immediately. His general idea was that the United Nations
                            could take the airport over and run it. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1"
                                >Nimetz</persName> felt it would be almost as easy to solve the
                            whole Cyprus problem as to open the airport because basic questions
                            would arise immediately in airport negotiations. He noted that the
                            Turkish Cypriots would not want to give up operating their own airport
                            at Ercan. <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName> concurred
                            that opening Nicosia would take time.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName> explained that these
                            difficulties caused him to think of the aid proposal. He asked whether
                            the United States could see if his aid proposal would be attractive in
                            Ankara. He had mentioned it to Secretary-General <persName
                                corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName>. The Secretary responded that
                            the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> would be glad to try; he
                            couldn’t promise what could be done.</p>
                        <p>9. The Secretary asked <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> for
                            his view on whether we should raise this with Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_ES_1">Elekdag</persName> or with Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_EH_1">Erkmen</persName>. <pb n="253"
                                facs="0286" xml:id="pg_253"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> responded that we would
                            have to give some thought to this. The Secretary noted that Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_EH_1">Erkmen</persName> is a decent,
                            reasonable, experienced man and should be personally involved in the
                            effort. Rolandis believed it would be better to make the approach to
                                <persName corresp="#p_EH_1">Erkmen</persName>.</p>
                        <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> asked <persName
                                corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName> how he thought <persName
                                corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> would react to this proposal.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> said <persName
                                corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> has a strong hold on Turkish
                            Cyprus policy at the moment. <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1"
                                >Rolandis</persName> concurred that <persName corresp="#p_DR_1"
                                >Denktash</persName> has a good deal of power at the present time.
                            He noted that <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> recently
                            has been making unfavorable statements. The only hope was that the
                            economic problems which face the Turkish Cypriots might mean that
                                <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> would be attracted
                            to the aid for Varosha proposal. He felt that Ankara could handle
                                <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> on this if the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> really wished to do so.</p>
                        <p>11. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> noted that with regard
                            to <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName>’ third proposal, the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> previously had not made it easy
                            for international organizations to work in the north of Cyprus. Would
                            this attitude now change? <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1"
                                >Rolandis</persName> replied that it would have to. He said this is
                            one of the important elements of the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1"
                                >GOC</gloss>’s current discussions with the <gloss target="#t_EC_1"
                                >EC</gloss> on possible assistance for Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>12. The Secretary closed the meeting by saying he would think about how
                            we might help promote <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName>’
                            idea. It was agreed that we would give some reaction to <persName
                                corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName> when Deputy Secretary

                            handle the press on the visit. The Secretary noted that in his February
                            5 testimony before the HFAC he had said that the Cyprus problem remains;
                            it is the only world problem that is as difficult as the Arab-Israeli

                            <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName> said he would make a
                            short statement that he had come to see the Secretary to report to him
                            about his conversation with <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1"
                                >Waldheim</persName>. All agreed that any discussion of the Rolandis
                            aid idea should be held as closely as possible.</p>
                        <p>14. In a later meeting with Under Secretary-designate <persName
                                corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1"
                                >Rolandis</persName> suggested that the aid money might be channeled
                            through the Evkaf, a religious group in the north. That way <persName
                                corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> could use it as he sees fit.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> remarked that the plan
                            has merit because it gives the Turkish Cypriots needed financial aid
                            without political concessions on the part of the <gloss

                        <pb n="254" facs="0287" xml:id="pg_254"/>
                        <p>15. When asked what amount of money he had in mind, <persName
                                corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName> mentioned dols 50 million as
                            a realistic sum. He cautioned that he hadn’t thoroughly considered what
                            the total amount should be and had yet to clear the figure with
                                <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> and the Cabinet. He
                            said that, in any event, the money must not be a token amount and must
                            be enough to begin to bring the island’s two economies closer to
                            equality.</p>
                        <p>16. On the issue of resettlement of Varosha by Greek Cypriots, <persName
                                corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName> said that a reopened Varosha
                            would create jobs for hundreds of Turkish Cypriots. This, too, would
                            improve the economic condition of the north. The reopened area of
                            Varosha would have to be large enough to house 30–35 thousand Greek
                            Cypriots.</p>
                        <p>17. <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName> would also ask the
                                “<gloss target="#t_TFSC_1">TFSC</gloss>” to reopen the main road
                            from Nicosia to Larnaca. While this is not a major concession, he said
                            it would improve the political climate in the spirit of paragraph 5 of
                            the May 19 Agreement.</p>
                        <p>18. <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName> told <persName
                                corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> that the creation of a <gloss
                                target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss> committee on Cyprus can be avoided
                            if productive talks are started. He wanted the <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> to know that the committee idea was not conceived to
                            cause us discomfort. Once <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName> got started with promoting the idea, it became
                            impossible to stop. <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName>
                            assured <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> that, should the
                            committee idea come to fruition, the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1"
                                >GOC</gloss> will do everything it can to see that the membership is
                            not objectionable to the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> In reply,
                                <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> told the Foreign
                            Minister that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> understands the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>’s need to take advantage of the
                            U.N. cycle in making its case to the world. However, we still believe
                            that the committee will be an impediment to real progress.</p>
                        <p>19. Before <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName> left,
                                <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> asked him if he wanted
                            the financial assistance concept to be portrayed as a <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> or a <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1"
                                >Waldheim</persName> idea. <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1"
                                >Rolandis</persName> said that it should be portrayed as a <persName
                                corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> plan or the Turkish side will
                            reject it immediately. <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName>
                            will telephone <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> February
                            6 to get his agreement to call this “the <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1"
                                >Waldheim</persName> Plan”. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1"
                                >Nimetz</persName> agreed to discuss the idea further on February 7
                            when <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName> meets with the
                            Deputy Secretary.</p>
                        <p>20. Comment: We find the <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName>
                            proposal for aid to north Cyprus interesting because it does offer a new
                            way to try to break the logjam preventing movement on the intercommunal
                            negotiations. We are concerned about a number of points: It is not clear
                            whether <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName> has the full
                            agreement with his government for the scheme. There would be numerable
                            negotiating difficulties as regards the size of the area to be open,
                            access, jurisdiction, etc. Nevertheless, we have committed ourselves to
                            be as helpful as possible, and would appreciate Posts’ comments on the
                                <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName> idea and how we
                            might promote it. End comment.</p>

                        <p>Cyprus talks remain stuck on dead center, with <persName
                                corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> trying to get them started
                            again. Basically everybody is merely talking about talking—and there is
                            not even much of that going on. Neither Greek nor Turkish Cypriots has
                            made the slightest move that would get talks between them going again
                            and there is no solid reason to believe that either side really wants
                            talks—public positions notwithstanding. Neither Ankara nor Athens has
                            attempted to play a significant role in this process in recent months
                            nor is there much likelihood that they will in the coming months, since
                            both are preoccupied with issues of much greater importance. Cyprus is
                            no longer a burning domestic issue in either Greece or Turkey.</p>

                                Cypriot representatives had prevented progress along the lines of
                                the ten-point agreement of May 19, 1979 (see <ref target="#d67"

                            April 2 report to the General Assembly on Cyprus notes that his efforts
                            have “not, so far, borne fruit”.<note n="3" xml:id="d77fn3">See <ref

                            there has been no real progress in resuming the stalled intercommunal
                            talks since they broke down in June 1979. Embassy Ankara has raised
                            several important questions relating to the Cyprus issue. We believe it
                            is time to reassess US Cyprus policy and explore possible methods of
                            breaking the current deadlock.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">US Interests</p>
                        <p>For both humanitarian and policy reasons, the US is clearly interested in
                            a resolution of the Cyprus problem. While Cyprus is not the salient
                            issue of controversy it was four years ago, it has the potential of
                            re-surfacing as a major problem in our relationships in the eastern
                            Mediterranean.</p>
                        <p>At the present time, the situation on the island is stable and
                            international interest has declined. Traditional proponents of the
                            Greek-Cypriot cause in the United States have markedly decreased the
                            intensity and frequency of their efforts to prod the Administration to
                            solve the Cyprus problem by taking an anti-Turkish line. Newspaper items
                            on US-Turkey relations seldom mention Cyprus. At least for the present,
                            both communities on Cyprus prefer the status quo to making the
                            concessions that a compromise solution would entail. In light of the
                            relative stability on the island and the back seat the issue has assumed
                                <pb n="257" facs="0290" xml:id="pg_257"/>in both US domestic and
                            international politics, we must consider what options and risks we have
                            before us as we pursue a Cyprus settlement.</p>

                        <p>There are several avenues open to attempt to move the negotiations off
                            dead-center. (Pros and Cons of each option are listed in the
                                Attachment).<note n="4" xml:id="d77fn4">Attached but not printed is
                                a paper titled “Cyprus: Options for Resuming the Intercommunal
                                Talks,” which presents a number of “pros” and “cons” for how the
                                United States could help move the stalled negotiations
                                forward.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. Continue to support <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName>’s
                            efforts. This would involve behind-the-scenes lobbying with the parties
                            and public statements in support of <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1"
                                >Waldheim</persName>. This option would mean that the US should
                            avoid activities which might give the impression we are taking an
                            independent initiative.</p>
                        <p>2. A new US Initiative. This could be a low-key effort in normal
                            diplomatic channels or could be a highly visible act such as a visit to
                            the island by a senior US official, or a “Camp David” approach such as
                            recently suggested in a House Subcommittee report. The latter would
                            focus US and world opinion on Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>3. A British Initiative. Recent news reports have speculated that the
                            Thatcher government, having succeeded in Rhodesia, might like to try to
                            solve the Cyprus problem.</p>
                        <p>4. A Multi-Lateral Initiative. This would involve a joint effort by the
                            US, UK, <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss>, Canada and possibly
                            France.</p>
                        <p>5. A Conference of the Guarantor Powers. This is the approach which
                            produced the 1960 Constitution.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">US Policy</p>
                        <p>None of the above options identified in our analysis (Attachment) has
                            more than a slim chance of success. The political dynamics in the region
                            are such that no party is so committed to achieving a solution that it
                            is willing to make the required compromises. It is, however, essential
                            that the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> effort continue so that when
                            both sides’ firm positions gradually soften and eventually begin to
                            converge, a mechanism is in place to facilitate negotiations. We believe
                            that at least for the next several months, the United States should
                            continue to support the Secretary-General’s efforts and try to ensure
                            that no action endangers <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1"
                                >Waldheim</persName>’s efforts. This policy would require that we
                            allow <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> alone to play the
                            leading visible role as mediator. At the same time, we must actively
                            discourage developments like the unilateral Turkish-Cypriot resettlement
                            of Varosha, because they would sidetrack or even derail <persName
                                corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName>’s good-offices mission.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Long-Term Prospects for Cyprus</p>
                        <p>In effect, Cyprus negotiations are already underway. Each side is
                            publicly and privately developing and defining its position. It will
                            take a long time before uncompromising attitudes on central issues
                            evolve into attitudes which would promote the understanding and
                            acceptance of concepts which will be vital to a permanent solution.</p>
                        <p>There have been some basic changes since 1974. “<gloss
                                target="#t_enosis_1">Enosis</gloss>” is no longer a live cause among
                            Greek-Cypriots. The Greek-Cypriots are no longer able to pursue what
                            appeared to be their unwritten policy of systematically discouraging
                            Turkish-Cypriot presence on the island. The Turkish-Cypriots enjoy
                            security and autonomy but no longer benefit from the Greek-Cypriot
                            economy and do not receive international recognition. For many reasons,
                            the Athens government is less interested in active participation in
                            Cypriot affairs.</p>
                        <p>Both communities are beginning to realize that they must compromise to
                            achieve a solution. The Greek-Cypriots are becoming aware that the world
                            community will not or cannot force the Turkish Army to leave the island
                            without an overall settlement and that the political conditions prior to
                            August 1974 will not return. By the same token, the Turkish-Cypriots may
                            eventually realize that the world will not accept them as an independent
                            state and that they cannot survive in an economically isolated
                            condition.</p>
                        <p>Neither the US nor any other power can create the pre-conditions for a
                            solution. Those changes must come from the Cypriots themselves. In fact,
                            a bold initiative runs the risk of actually worsening the prospects for
                            a solution. For the moment, it may be best to allow time to run its
                            course and, in the process, erode the hardened positions until both
                            communities reach the point where they have the will to resolve their
                            dispute. At that time it might be useful for an outside interested party
                            to offer once again to be helpful. We should continue to consult with
                            the UK, <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss>, Canada and France and to
                            monitor the situation to determine when the time is right for a new

                        <p>That the US continue to consult with all parties in support of the

                            renew our offer to assist the Secretary-General in any appropriate

                            initiative during the remainder of this year but would begin now to
                            consult with the British and our other allies to get their views on how
                            an initiative might usefully be promoted in the first quarter of 1981
                            when there should be a “window” in the internationalization season.<note

                        <p>The resumption on August 9 by the Greek and Turkish Cypriots of
                            long-recessed (since June 1979) intercommunal talks is a result of the

                            a serious, sustained manner. It also stemmed from painstaking efforts by

                        <p>There has been growing impatience in Cyprus with President <persName

                        <p>Moreover, Parliamentary elections are expected in September 1981. They

                            Since last fall, the Greek Cypriots have become less enamored with the
                            committee idea (the Turks always opposed it) probably because they could

                            Committee no matter how docile, and because while the Committee might
                            serve to cast world public attention on the Cyprus issue, it would
                            retard, if not preclude, any concomitant negotiating effort.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, the Greek Cypriots were concerned as to what new “victory”
                            they could hope to achieve at this year’s General Assembly. Thus, while
                            the Greek Cypriots certainly have not given up on using the
                            international arena to advance their cause in the future, they have
                            apparently decided to play this year’s <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1"

                                453–454.</note> This statement was the result of months of
                            negotiations and actually outlines some of the major issues that will be
                            discussed: a constitutional system that will be federal, a territorial
                            solution that will be bizonal, priority to the Greek resettlement of
                            Varosha, and attention to practical methods of achieving economic and
                            humanitarian progress on the island. At some undefined early stage,
                            negotiations on these four topics are to be delegated to committees. The
                            security concerns of the Turkish Cypriots are also acknowledged to be
                            something that must be addressed. All these ideas are descendants of the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> plan we submitted in 1978, and
                            thus we can take justifiable pride in the role we have played.<note
                                n="6" xml:id="d79fn6">See <ref target="#d61fn2">footnote 2, Document
                                    61</ref>.</note> However, it is important the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> role be quiet and behind-the-scenes
                            and that the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> remain out front.</p>
                        <p>Each of the areas for discussion has special difficulties. The Turkish
                            Cypriots will juxtapose their requirements for “security” and a
                            “bizonal” political structure with Greek Cypriot desires to recover
                            occupied territory and preserve the unity of the Cypriot state. Clearly,
                            there are tradeoffs between territory and constitutional aspects.
                            Currently, the Turkish Cypriots (about 18 percent of the population)
                            backed by the Turkish army hold approximately 37 percent of the island.
                            This includes some of the best farming land and a major port and tourist
                            area (Famagusta). Turkish seizure of these sectors in 1974 resulted in
                            displacement of approximately 150,000 Greek Cypriots, many of whom still
                            seek to return. This is particularly true of Varosha, which is a
                            relatively new and potentially very profitable tourist city in <pb
                                n="263" facs="0296" xml:id="pg_263"/>the Turkish Cypriot zone now
                            unpopulated. Clearly, territorial adjustments are possible; the Turks
                            have indicated that the Turkish Cypriots will be flexible and the Greek
                            Cypriots do not expect to limit Turkish Cypriots to only 18 percent of
                            the island (Greek Cypriot interlocutors have privately suggested 25
                            percent). <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> will be a
                            tough negotiator on this subject as he will not want to displace
                            resettled Turks.</p>
                        <p>Turkish Cypriot requirements on the constitutional/bizonality issues
                            remain somewhat nebulous. Arguments have raged for years over what
                            “bizonality” <hi rend="italic">actually</hi> means. The Greek Cypriots
                            claim the Turkish Cypriot goal is a confederal state so weak that the
                            Turkish Cypriot sector will effectively be independent. (There are
                            continuing reports that the Turkish Cypriot leader ultimately intends to
                            seek independence for his area; however, there is no reason to think
                            that the Turkish Government or any other government would tolerate such
                            a unilateral action.) It is likely that the Turkish Cypriots would
                            accept a federal structure with considerable local autonomy including a
                            local police force and some access controls, ceding defense, foreign
                            affairs and central bank powers to a Federal government.</p>
                        <p>Thus, while tradeoffs appear possible, the Turkish Cypriots recognize
                            that territory is their strongest card and will seek maximum Greek
                            Cypriot concessions on constitutional issues before agreeing on an
                            overall package settlement.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Next Steps:</p>
                        <p>The atmosphere at the opening session August 9 was cordial and the
                            meeting went very well. However, as was to be expected, shortly after
                            the meeting President <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName>
                            gave a press conference in which he “clarified” some of the terms under
                            use, and reaffirmed his position that “bizonality” means partition and
                            that all refugees must return to their homes. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> felt it necessary to respond,
                            and the latest information is that some time after the Turkish “bayram”
                            holiday ends on August 14, his government will meet to decide whether or
                            not the <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> statements are
                            an impediment to continuing with the talks. We think that the talks will
                            proceed as scheduled.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">A Role for the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss>:</p>
                        <p>We believe this round of talks will continue for some while and not be
                            ruptured after a few days as was the case in 1979 since:</p>
                        <p>—The sequence of meetings (one meeting each week on four basic subject
                            areas starting September 16) makes probable at least two months of
                            negotiations;</p>
                        <p>—Both sides for reasons elaborated above should be willing at least to
                            continue the talks through most of the <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1"
                                >UNGA</gloss> session;</p>
                        <p>—Both sides recognize that an early breakdown of the talks would mean a
                            protracted delay in further intercommunal talks. Thus, if not a <pb
                                n="264" facs="0297" xml:id="pg_264"/>“last chance,” these talks are
                            surely the best chance for the immediate future of making progress to
                            resolve outstanding issues. More importantly, this point seems to be
                            realized by key figures in both communities.</p>
                        <p>In order to decide what the United States can and should do to facilitate
                            the negotiations and to make them productive, it is important that we
                            have a clear picture of United Nations thinking and plans. You will be

                            We should also discuss ways we might be of assistance to the <gloss

                        <p>—Investigate “practical measures” such as facilitating Turkish Cypriot

                        <p>—Offer to make demarches to the interested parties to emphasize the
                            importance of getting on seriously with the talks. One approach would be

                                >Kyprianou</persName>—and a letter from Secretary <persName

                        <p>—Take another look at our November 1978 proposals to determine whether

                        <p>The United Nations Secretary General is really not in a position

                            entirely focused on Cyprus intercommunal negotiations and international

                        <p>1. Meeting began with a short private session between Secretary and
                                <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName>. When rest of group
                            joined, Secretary said he had been emphasizing to <persName
                                corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName> the need to give and take on
                            both sides to achieve progress in Cyprus talks. Any <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> intervention would have to be done
                            judiciously and with a careful eye to timing. He said we would stay in
                            touch with <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> through Under Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName>.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> noted that in our first
                            communication with the new Turkish military authorities in Ankara on the
                            day of the takeover our Ambassador had discussed Cyprus with

                                6587 from Ankara, September 12. Turkmen assured Ambassador <persName

                                military government, remained committed to achieving a solution for
                                the Cyprus dispute. (National Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1"

                                D800435–0566)</note> We had emphasized need for Cyprus intercommunal
                            talks to be forward going and sustained.</p>
                        <p>3. Secretary asked <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName> if
                            the first phase of the resumed intercommunal talks would be pro-forma.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName> explained the
                            organization of the talks with four subjects to be discussed weekly in
                            rotation. Two were subordinate and would be covered in the first two
                            sessions: Varosha and confidence-building measures. The other two to be
                            considered in the third and fourth sessions were more basic:
                            constitution and territory. <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1"
                                >Rolandis</persName> noted it would take four weeks to complete a
                            cycle, with the first cycle given to explanations. He thought the second
                            cycle would be crucial as this would be when counter-proposals would be
                            presented with possible sharp reactions. The Special Representative of
                            the Secretary General would have to be very careful in this phase. If he
                            got through it, however, and the dialogue was kept going, future cycles
                            should be easier.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName> said meeting of
                            interlocutors on September 16 had been very good.<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d80fn3">Another round of intercommunal talks had opened on
                                August 9. See <hi rend="italic">Yearbook of the United Nations,
                                    1980,</hi> pp. 453–454.</note> The atmosphere was cordial. The
                            Turkish Cypriots had said that they had come with the “will to find a
                            way,” and they seemed to be serious about this.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName> went on to express
                            hope that “some countries including the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss>” would help by influencing Turkey in the right way. He
                            felt that the new military authorities in Ankara are in a position to
                            take decisions on Cyprus because they do not have to cater to the small,
                            extremist political parties. Further, he thought it would be easier for
                            the army to “undo what was done in 1974” than it would be for any
                            political party who could be accused of betrayal.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName> said it was his
                            government’s strong hope and belief that this time there is a chance.
                            The <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> does not want to miss this
                            opportunity. The <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> also believes that
                            Secretary General <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> is
                            determined to go for sustained talks. <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1"
                                >Rolandis</persName> had discussed intercommunal talks with
                                <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> September 22.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName> said he hoped that
                            the bad experience of the short-lived June 1979 talks will not be
                            repeated. The <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> will be patient and
                            will concentrate on the smallest positive points to keep the process
                            going. It wanted to see the talks be sustained.</p>
                        <p>7. The <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1"
                                >Rolandis</persName> said, is deferring most if not all of its
                            international activities in order to promote progress in the talks. It
                            would <pb n="267" facs="0300" xml:id="pg_267"/>adopt a low-profile
                            approach. His address before the General Assembly would be carefully
                            expressed but positive noting the talks and calling on all concerned to
                            help the Secretary General. He would avoid mentioning that Cyprus is
                            occupied by foreign troops. The <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>
                            also will not pursue recourses in the Human Rights Commission, in
                            Strasbourg and Geneva, and in <gloss target="#t_ICAO_1">ICAO</gloss> as
                            long as the talks continue. In short, the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1"
                                >GOC</gloss> intended to display good will and helpful to
                            moderation. <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName> repeated
                            that the changed Turkish situation may improve resolution of the Cyprus
                            problem and wondered whether the time was right for the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> to help to the degree it could.</p>
                        <p>8. The Secretary said he was very pleased with the constructive and
                            flexible approach being taken by the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1"
                                >GOC</gloss> and hoped both sides would take this same approach.
                            Patience is needed, he said, and we should measure progress in months,
                            not days. He reiterated that we would be wise in our selection of the
                            right time and method to use our influence.</p>
                        <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName> said that the GOL
                            would always be receptive to any message from the Secretary or his
                            associates. His government really wants a solution and is willing to
                            consider any ideas. Cyprus is small; there is no reason why the whole
                            population should not share in its prosperity.</p>
                        <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> observed that the
                            situation is better now than it has been in the three-and-one half years
                            he has been following the issue. On tactics, <persName corresp="#p_NM_1"
                                >Nimetz</persName> thought that the third cycle of considering the
                            four subjects would be the most critical because the first would be
                            largely the presentation of formal proposals and the second of formal
                            counterproposals. The important thing, he said, was to get past the
                            first real negotiating sessions with the mechanism of the talks intact.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> noted that he had had
                            lunch with Turkish Cypriots same day (<persName corresp="#p_AK_1"
                                >Atakol</persName> and Alzlay being reported <gloss
                                target="#t_septel_1">septel</gloss>) and they expect the debate to
                            be joined in the third round.<note n="4" xml:id="d80fn4">No record of
                                this meeting was found.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> thought that at that point
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> and perhaps other outside help
                            might be useful particularly if done quietly.</p>
                        <p>11. <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName> said he had always
                            considered that there were two fora: the plenary sessions themselves and
                                <gloss target="#t_SRSG_1">SRSG</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GH_1">Gobbi</persName>’s behind the scenes
                            activities. He had always felt that the real problems could not be
                            solved in plenary and thus the role of <persName corresp="#p_GH_1"
                                >Gobbi</persName> was important. His private work will be important
                            when one of the two sides is tempted to break off the talks because of
                            unacceptable positions taken by the other.</p>
                        <p>12. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> recalled that one idea
                            had been to have working groups or sub-committees to get over the hard
                            points. <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName> noted that it
                                <pb n="268" facs="0301" xml:id="pg_268"/>had been agreed that these
                            could be established. <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName>
                            said the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> would keep the US fully
                            informed through Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SGL_2"
                                >Stone</persName>.</p>
                        <p>13. The Secretary closed the meeting by saying that he was delighted to
                            get <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName>’ briefing and as a
                            result has a sense of cautious optimism about the Cyprus situation.</p>

                            tour d’horizon encompassing the intercommunal talks and the role that
                            may be played by Greece and Turkey, Cypriot domestic politics, and US
                            aid to Cyprus. End summary.</p>

                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_JA_1">Jacovides</persName> opened the discussion
                            with a brief review of the intercommunal talks. He was mildly critical
                            of the “orchestrated” Turkish Cypriot press stories on the Greek Cypriot
                            territorial proposal suggesting that this kind of story suggested “bad
                            faith” in revealing to the press the details of a confidential
                            negotiation. If the Turkish Cypriots didn’t like the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> proposal, they should present their
                            own. In conclusion, however, both negotiators had been making fairly
                            positive statements and the course of the negotiations could best be
                            described as “so far, so good”.</p>
                        <p>4. Following this line, <persName corresp="#p_JA_1">Jacovides</persName>
                            remarked upon <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName>’s visit to
                            Ankara and his “unnecessary” departure statement (Ref A and B). He
                            observed that most recognize it would be in Turkish interest to do
                            something positive on Cyprus and that <gloss target="#t_FM_1">FM</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TI_1">Turkmen</persName> is a known and positive
                            quality. Nevertheless, <persName corresp="#p_JA_1">Jacovides</persName>
                            noted nothing is known about what the Turks might do and consequently he
                            asked if the US had any information that would make the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> feel “more comfortable”.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> responded that in both
                            the content and tone of discussions about Cyprus, the Turks have given
                            us reason to believe they are interested in solving the problem. We do
                            not expect great leaps in policy but Ankara has been able to face up to
                            tough decisions. Progress has been made on the economy and political
                            terrorism and <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> hoped the
                            same philosophy would be applied to the Cyprus problem. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> noted—and stressed its
                            applicability to the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> as well—that
                            the US had been emphasizing that problem solving brings political
                            benefits. He commented that too many countries see only the
                            disadvantages of problem solving. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1"
                                >Nimetz</persName> concluded that Ankara wants the negotiations to
                            continue and was prepared to give <persName corresp="#p_DR_1"
                                >Denktash</persName> a push as necessary.</p>
                        <p>6. <gloss target="#t_DAS_1">DAS</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_ERC_1">Ewing</persName> suggested that the timing
                            of <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName>’s visit to Ankara was
                            interesting as the parties were reaching a stage where future positions
                            would have to be developed. <persName corresp="#p_JA_1"
                                >Jacovides</persName> suggested the third sequence of meetings would
                            be particularly important. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName>
                            suggested making a more cautious judgement as both communities were now
                            locked into positions. He recalled that negotiations often are lengthy
                            and that discussions outside the main meetings often provide the keys to
                            progress. He suggested consequently that he would not be pessimistic if
                            the third round of meetings was not particularly eventful. It was,
                                <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> concluded, too much to
                            expect fresh concessions in the third round.</p>
                        <p>7. Responding to a question by <persName corresp="#p_NM_1"
                                >Nimetz</persName> on the effect of Greek reintegration on the
                            talks, <persName corresp="#p_JA_1">Jacovides</persName> was mildly
                            positive. He noted that <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> as
                            well as <persName corresp="#p_MK_1">Mitsotakis</persName> had explicitly
                            stated that reintegration would lead to progress on the Cyprus problem.
                            In the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> statement (Ref C), Nicosia
                            had carefully not said that the effects would be positive <pb n="270"
                                facs="0303" xml:id="pg_270"/>but (resisting the negative proposals
                            of <gloss target="#t_AKEL_1">AKEL</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_EDEK_1"
                                >EDEK</gloss>) taken the line that reintegration was Athens’
                            decision and that the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> hoped for
                            continued Greek support.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> suggested that
                            reintegration was a major step. The improved atmosphere between Greece
                            and Turkey would make it easier to solve problems. Recalling that a wide
                            variety of US-Turkey problems had been resolved, <persName
                                corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> noted that Cyprus was one of the
                            few remaining and consequently focus on the issue would heighten.</p>
                        <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_JA_1">Jacovides</persName> cautioned that
                            protracted intercommunal discussions would foster the belief that the
                            talks were being used to evade action in international fora. He observed
                            that it was clear which side (the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>)
                            was more damaged by inconclusive dialogue and that the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> would have problems regaining
                            international attention and momentum if the talks did not develop. Still
                                <persName corresp="#p_JA_1">Jacovides</persName> observed that
                            factors in several areas e.g., Greek elections, Middle East turmoil
                            could have a positive effect on the talks. Progress on Cyprus could help
                                <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName>’ electoral position
                            against the left and difficulty in the Middle East suggests the efficacy
                            of a strong <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> and hence settling
                            intra Alliance problems such as Cyprus. <persName corresp="#p_JA_1"
                                >Jacovides</persName> hoped, however, there would be no slackening
                            of US efforts on the Cyprus issue.</p>
                        <p>10. Recalling earlier US efforts to resolve the Cyprus problem and
                            regretting its difficult nature, <persName corresp="#p_NM_1"
                                >Nimetz</persName> assured <persName corresp="#p_JA_1"
                                >Jacovides</persName> that Cyprus is on the US agenda and that we
                            have every intention of working for a solution of the problem. In the
                            course of comments on President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                >Carter</persName>’s Cyprus statement (Ref D), <persName
                                corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> recalled that both the rule of
                            law and geopolitical realities suggested the need to resolve the Cyprus
                            problem. Not even a cynic would suggest that Greece and Turkey could
                            cooperate peacefully without solving the Cyprus problem.</p>
                        <p>11. In response to <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName>’s
                            question on the effects of recent domestic developments on the talks,
                                <persName corresp="#p_JA_1">Jacovides</persName> stated that the key
                            government figures and all political parties with the possible exception
                            of <gloss target="#t_EDEK_1">EDEK</gloss> are committed to the talks.
                            Consequently, <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> would not
                            be hindered in decision making if the Turkish Cypriots made a “just and
                            reasonable” proposal. He recalled that in 1977 Makarios had made
                            proposals even though the Turkish Government appeared weak and that
                            Ankara should not be misled by the appearance of domestic disarray in
                            Nicosia to avoid forthcoming proposals. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1"
                                >Nimetz</persName> stated that this point could be useful in
                            conversation with Ankara.</p>
                        <p>12. Turning to the question of refugee aid for Cyprus, <persName
                                corresp="#p_JA_1">Jacovides</persName> made a strong case for
                            continued US assistance. He said he understood the US Embassy opposed
                            further assistance but he stressed the political utility of completing
                            the half-finished refugee rehousing program. If refugees were suitably
                            rehoused there would be less pressure to return to property in the
                            north. Thus while the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> would not
                            give up the <pb n="271" facs="0304" xml:id="pg_271"/>“principle” that
                            all refugees must be permitted to return, the reality of situation would

                            urged that the administration support the refugee program and not be
                            viewed as opposing congressional funding. The money would be well used,
                            benefitted Turkish Cypriots as well, and actually should be adjusted
                            upward to account for inflation. Administration support for refugee aid
                            would strengthen the image of the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                            in Nicosia as concerned about the Cyprus problem and consequently have a

                        <p>13. In response <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> noted
                                <persName corresp="#p_JA_1">Jacovides</persName>’ effective,
                            comprehensive presentation but recalled the wide variety of pressing
                            refugee problems worldwide e.g., Southeast Asia, Afghanistan, Somalia.
                            While recognizing that aid for Cyprus was a reaffirmation that the
                            political problem posed by the island had not ended, <persName

                            refugee relief was less persuasive each year and harder to argue
                            vis-a-vis competing refugee needs.</p>

                        <p>SUMMARY: The second sequence of four intercommunal meetings has brought
                            slight substantive progress but also some deterioration of the
                            negotiating atmosphere as traditional animosities flared at the final
                            meeting dealing with the most controversial issue—territory.<note n="2"

                                this sentence.</note> Despite this, we believe a basic
                            goal—institutionalization of the talks—is virtually achieved. The
                            prospect of movement toward rapid solution of the Cyprus problem,
                            however, remains highly remote and <pb n="272" facs="0305"
                                xml:id="pg_272"/>progress on the issues that divide the communities
                            is likely to be painstakingly slow.</p>
                        <p>DISCUSSION: The second sequence of substantive discussion on the four
                            basic topics of the Cyprus intercommunal ended on November 12. Meetings
                            were held on October 15 and 31 (skipping a week for Muslim religious
                            holidays and Turkish National Day) and November 5 and 12. They have and
                            will continue to address the agreed topics in rotation (Varosha,
                            “practical measures”, constitutional issues and territory) at meetings
                            approximately once weekly.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Substance</p>
                        <p>Both sides continued to develop their positions moving slightly beyond
                            opening proposals on Varosha and “practical measures”. In discussing
                            Varosha, the Turkish Cypriots proposed that an undefined portion of the
                            city be demilitarized and jointly administered by Greek and Turkish
                            Cypriots and <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> officials. No limit was
                            placed on the numbers of Greek Cypriots permitted to return to the area.
                            A key element of this proposal, for which the Greek Cypriot negotiator
                            pressed in vain, is to define the extent of the proposed area.</p>
                        <p>Regarding “practical measures”, the Greek Cypriots responded positively
                            on minor Turkish Cypriot requests for outstanding social security
                            payments and cooperation in the health field, but objected to other
                            Turkish Cypriot proposals on passports and elimination of the economic
                            embargo as implying Greek Cypriot recognition of the “<gloss
                                target="#t_TFSC_1">TFSC</gloss>”. The Turkish Cypriot negotiator
                            promised to cooperate with Greek Cypriot requests for documents (land
                            records, bank books, birth certificates) left in the north since
                            1974.</p>
                        <p>The meetings on constitutional and territorial issues were still more
                            difficult. The Greek Cypriots for example pressed for Turkish Cypriot
                            positions on territory, claiming that without precise boundaries a new
                            federal constitution could not be formulated. Following a protracted,
                            indecisive session on the constitution, <gloss target="#t_SRSG_1"
                                >SRSG</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GH_1">Gobbi</persName> concluded that the only
                            point of agreement by the parties was that Cyprus should be a federal
                            republic and that fundamental rights and liberties should be guaranteed.
                            The session on territory was likewise unproductive with the Greek
                            Cypriots urging the Turkish Cypriots to present a specific map of their
                            territorial requirements and view Cyprus as an integrated economic unit.
                            The Turkish Cypriot negotiator, however, flatly rejected the concept of
                            an integrated economic community.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Tone</p>
                        <p>The negotiating atmosphere remained reasonably good with both sides
                            seriously presenting their positions and exploring each other’s
                            proposals. Apparently, the Greek Cypriot negotiator (<persName
                                corresp="#p_IG_1">Ioannides</persName>) is demonstrating
                            considerable forebearance at the negotiating table, a <pb n="273"
                                facs="0306" xml:id="pg_273"/>characteristic particularly evident
                            during the final meeting on “territory” when the Turkish Cypriot bluntly
                            and emotionally rejected an extensive presentation directed at
                            considering Cyprus as an integrated economic unit. <persName
                                corresp="#p_IG_1">Ioannides</persName>, however, made a conciliatory
                            response.</p>
                        <p>Politicization of the talks was accentuated by the publicity surrounding
                                <gloss target="#t_SYG_1">SYG</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName>’s invitation to
                                <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_AK_1">Atakol</persName> to meet in NYC in mid-November.
                            Although the proposal was subsequently rejected, the style of the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> rejection exposed it to both internal
                            criticism from Famagusta refugees and the Turkish Cypriots. Each side
                            also resorted to public posturing on the territorial issue with
                                <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> stating that a
                            specific village (located in a salient extending into the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>-controlled area) would not be
                            returned, a position totally unacceptable to the Greek Cypriots. For his
                            part, <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> asserted that all
                            refugees would be able to return to their homes. Still the level of
                            rhetoric has remained within bounds and tempers are still under
                            control.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Prospects</p>
                        <p>The conclusion of the first two rounds suggests that the initial
                            goal—institutionalization of the talks—has been reached. The third round
                            scheduled to end in mid-December should reinforce this conclusion but
                            without substantive progress. Thus while there has been no breakthrough,
                            neither has there been any breakdown. We can expect the talks to
                            continue at least for the immediate future and consequently there is
                            breathing room for further discussion, presentation of proposals, and
                            ultimately of compromise.</p>
                        <p>Several events are on the horizon:</p>
                        <p>—the ultimate <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> position on a <gloss
                                target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss> debate of the Cyprus issue is still
                            undetermined. Although Cyprus is on the <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1"
                                >UNGA</gloss> agenda, no time for debate has been formally scheduled
                            and the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> is attempting to use the
                            prospect of avoiding debate and putting the item off until 1981 as a
                            lever to induce Turkish Cypriot flexibility in the intercommunal
                            talks.</p>
                        <p>—meetings between high ranking Greek and Turkish Cypriots and <gloss
                                target="#t_SYG_1">SYG</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> remain possible. The
                            Security Council will meet in mid-December for a routine six-month
                            renewal of <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP_1">UNFICYP</gloss>’s mandate. It is
                            likely that <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> would meet
                            separately with the ranking <gloss target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss> and
                            Turkish Cypriot representatives and such meetings, if held, could be
                            mildly productive. If the third round is unproductive, however, <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Secretariat officials may be tempted to
                            roll out personal proposals even if the negotiating scene is not yet
                            ready for them.</p>
                        <p>The fundamental fact that the parties are far apart in substance
                            continues to pertain. A Turkish official recently commented that the
                            negotiations could take two years to end, and this appears optimistic to
                            many observers.</p>

                                >Jacovides</persName> discussed inter alia the effect of the
                            transition on <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> policy toward Cyprus
                            and the status of the intercommunal talks. End summary.</p>
                        <p>3. After brief exchange on the effects of the transition in terms of
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> policy toward Africa and South
                            America, <persName corresp="#p_JA_1">Jacovides</persName> commented on
                            future <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> attitudes toward Cyprus. He
                            suggested that the current level of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            support for the U.N. framework and the intercommunal talks was the right
                            approach. He noted that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> was
                            watching the process on the sidelines and observed that the
                            intercommunal talks have developed somewhat although thus far not yet in
                            substantive terms. The climate was good. He assumed the Turkish military
                            takeover would help as in his opinion the Turks could no longer plead
                            that they had a weak government. He recalled the <persName
                                corresp="#p_OUS_1">Onan</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_IG_1"
                                >Ioannides</persName> TV presentation (Ref A) as indicating that
                            while there were substantive differences, the spirit of the talks was
                            good.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_JA_1">Jacovides</persName> expressed some
                            concern, however, over potentially disruptive statements such as
                                <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName>’s comments on
                            territory (Ref B) and Turkish <gloss target="#t_FM_1">FM</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TI_1">Turkmen</persName>’s interview with “Yanki”
                            (Ref C). <persName corresp="#p_TI_1">Turkmen</persName>’s reported
                            statement that a Varosha accord could not be implemented before general
                            agreement surprised him and he labeled it “factually incorrect” inter
                            alia in the light of the May 1979 Agreement. <persName corresp="#p_JA_1"
                                >Jacovides</persName> then noted <persName corresp="#p_TI_1"
                                >Turkmen</persName>’s comment that the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> expressed to Turkey no deeper concern about Cyprus
                            than would Norway. Although he knew <pb n="275" facs="0308"
                                xml:id="pg_275"/>differently, <persName corresp="#p_JA_1"
                                >Jacovides</persName> stated that an interview of this nature
                            influenced some opinions in Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> observed that in the
                            interview <persName corresp="#p_TI_1">Turkmen</persName> was trying to
                            demonstrate international support for Turkey and attempting to portray
                            Ankara’s good relations with the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            While <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> noted he was pleased
                                <persName corresp="#p_TI_1">Turkmen</persName> had not suggested the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> was pressuring Ankara on
                            Cyprus, nevertheless it was clear we were more concerned and had done
                            more about the issue than Norway.</p>
                        <p>6. Turning to the intercommunal talks, <persName corresp="#p_NM_1"
                                >Nimetz</persName> stated the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            would be concerned if the currently scheduled recess beginning December
                            8 dragged on. He had the impression there had not been hard thinking on
                            either side concerning next steps. He observed that a time comes in any
                            negotiation for testing each other with solid proposals and suggested
                            the January–February period could be a critical time.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_JA_1">Jacovides</persName> responded that the
                            Greek Cypriots intended no slackening of the talks. He commented,
                            however, that it was a real sacrifice on the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1"
                                >GOC</gloss>’s part to eliminate discussion of the Cyprus issue in
                            international fora and remarked that the current situation with no
                            international discussion was obviously advantageous to the Turkish
                            Cypriots. Some evidence of a willingness to move on the Turkish part
                            would help to justify the current <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>
                            attitude. He hoped that a strong government in Ankara would be helpful
                            and suggested that Varosha was the place to start. Another 2–3 months
                            without progress would damage the talks’ momentum. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> agreed and suggested the sides
                            should consider the potential problem of how to sustain momentum in the
                            negotiations during the recess in the talks.</p>
                        <p>8. In retrospective comments, <persName corresp="#p_NM_1"
                                >Nimetz</persName> expressed disappointment that despite successes
                            in other areas of the region, there had not been as much movement on the
                            Cyprus issue. Still, he believed, the problem is solvable and with work
                            can be resolved. <persName corresp="#p_JA_1">Jacovides</persName>
                            agreed, adding that the catalyst could be Varosha as an agreement here
                            could resettle significant numbers of refugees and improve the
                            atmosphere. <persName corresp="#p_JA_1">Jacovides</persName> praised
                            Turkish <gloss target="#t_FM_1">FM</gloss> officials he knew as
                            reasonable, moderate people and concluded that Greece, Turkey and Cyprus
                            need not be weighed against each other as <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss> needed a strong Turkey and a reasonable, satisfactory
                            solution to the Cyprus problem should be achievable without damaging any
                            of the participants.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_EM_1">Esenbel</persName> complained
                            about the January 19 Departmental statement, which asked Congress to
                            withhold immediate consideration of the US-Turkish Defense Cooperation

                                agreement would not be sent forward, since we had initiated a full

                                corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> defended the statement, saying
                            it was the only means to stave off Congressional statements opposing the
                            US-Turkish security relationship. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1"
                                >Vance</persName> added that the US intended to complete its policy
                            review of the Eastern Mediterranean in the near future, and then would
                            strive to rebuild Turkish-US friendship. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_EM_1">Esenbel</persName> explained the latest Turkish
                            initiative on Cyprus by asserting that Ankara had virtually forced
                                <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> to write <persName

                            Turkey hoped would lead to detailed discussions of substantive issues
                            required for a negotiated Cyprus settlement. Mr. <pb n="277" facs="0310"

                            <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> said the US welcomed
                            meetings between <persName corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName>, and hoped they
                            would lead to early progress.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_EM_1">Esenbel</persName> opened the
                            meeting by recalling his conversation with Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> this summer, and handing the
                            Secretary-designate a congratulatory letter from the Turkish Foreign
                                Minister.<note n="3" xml:id="d84fn3">Not found.</note> Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> read the message and said he
                            would write a personal reply.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_EM_1">Esenbel</persName> then made a
                            lengthy presentation about the importance of the US-Turkish Defense
                            Cooperation Agreement (<gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>). The
                            document, in his view, aimed at correcting the imbalance in
                            Turkish-American relations created by Congressional action in late 1974.
                            It was the tool by which the two countries could renew and revitalize
                            close political and security relations. <persName corresp="#p_EM_1"
                                >Esenbel</persName> recalled the damage done to these relations over
                            the past two years and said now was the time to begin moving in a new
                            direction.</p>
                        <p>Turkey, asserted <persName corresp="#p_EM_1">Esenbel</persName>, had been
                            very patient. It had appreciated that little could be done preceding the
                            US elections and had accordingly waited quietly for more than ten
                            months. Now it appeared a further delay would be required, but <persName
                                corresp="#p_EM_1">Esenbel</persName> warned that Turkish patience
                            could not last indefinitely. There would soon be national elections, and
                            there was already heavy internal criticism of the Turkish Government
                            from both left and right. Failure of the US Congress to approve the
                                <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> would feed this opposition and
                            strengthen those in Turkey who believed the US was no longer a credible
                            or reliable ally.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, approval of the US-Turkish Agreement would bring
                            benefits to both sides. It would eliminate the remaining restrictions on
                            Turkish arms purchases in the US. It would enable US bases in Turkey to
                            begin functioning again. It would strengthen the Turkish Government in
                            defending close US-Turkish ties and help put those ties on a stronger,
                            stabler basis. In Alliance terms, it would mean that Turkey’s
                            contribution to <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> force levels
                            could be maintained and strengthened.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EM_1">Esenbel</persName> said he could not
                            disguise his Government’s concern at the statement issued by the State
                            Department on Wednesday.<note n="4" xml:id="d84fn4">January 19.</note>
                            This concern had already been registered by the Turkish Prime Minister
                            and Foreign Minister directly to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MWB_1"
                                >Macomber</persName>. The US statement, moreover, had already begun
                            to be exploited by the Greek press.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EM_1">Esenbel</persName> said he did not
                            understand why the <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName>
                            Administration decided to send the US-Turkish Agreement to Congress at
                            the last mo<pb n="278" facs="0311" xml:id="pg_278"/>ment. At the same
                            time, it was unclear to him why the new Administration felt so
                            apprehensive about having this step taken. Turkey never expected
                            immediate Congressional approval of the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1"
                                >DCA</gloss>, and it fully understood that the new Administration
                            would want initially to review its policies in the area. For this
                            reason, the statement issued on Wednesday seemed so unnecessary. What
                            was most worrisome was the extent to which the statement reflected the
                            new Administration’s felt need to placate the Greek lobby in
                            Congress.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EM_1">Esenbel</persName> concluded his
                            presentation by noting that Turks are a frank people who state their
                            views directly. It was the Turkish position that the US-Turkish <gloss
                                target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> must stand on its own merits and
                            cannot be linked to other subjects. Indeed, the very genesis of the
                            Agreement was a desire by both countries to separate the defense
                            relationship from other problems in the Eastern Mediterranean.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> said he would like to
                            respond frankly to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_EM_1"
                                >Esenbel</persName>’s comments. The new Administration felt deeply
                            about the need to maintain and strengthen the friendship between Turkey
                            and the US. It, too, wished to repair the damage which had been caused
                            in past years.</p>
                        <p>What occurred on Wednesday could be explained very simply. The US was in
                            a transition process, and the incoming Administration needed to review
                            the complex of issues involving Greece, Turkey and Cyprus. It had
                            informed Congress some weeks ago that this study would be undertaken,
                            and it was not yet complete.</p>
                        <p>The new Administration also believes that if the Turkish-US Agreement is
                            to get through Congress, considerable spadework on the Hill will be
                            required. There are many in Congress who feel strongly about Cyprus and
                            who have translated that concern into a deep interest in all issues
                            involving Greece and Turkey. The new Administration has not yet had a
                            chance to do the Congressional missionary work which it feels must be
                            done, and for this reason asked Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> to withhold transmitting the <gloss
                                target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> to the Congress. The request was made
                            to give the incoming Administration time to do its own spadework and
                            then present the issue in a way which gives no one an excuse to dig
                            themselves in in opposition. Unfortunately, the Agreement went forward.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> said he thought this
                            was simply a mistake, but within hours, the damage that he feared would
                            occur started to take shape. Congressmen began calling to say they would
                            have to come out publicly in opposition to the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1"
                                >DCA</gloss> if the State Department remained silent. It was in an
                            effort to forestall such statements—and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1"
                                >Vance</persName> noted that none were made—that the new
                            Administration felt it had to issue the statement it did.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> said he understood the
                            Turkish position, and pledged that the new Administration would work as
                            rapidly as possible to com<pb n="279" facs="0312" xml:id="pg_279"/>plete
                            the required internal study and then would constructively try to move
                            forward to restore the US relationship with Turkey.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_EM_1">Esenbel</persName> said he had no
                            doubt in his own mind that the new Administration was sincere in wanting
                            to restore US-Turkish relations. He could even understand why some
                            statement had to be issued on Wednesday. What he could not comprehend
                            was why the statement had to link the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1"
                                >DCA</gloss> with a review of “other related issues.” Such linkage
                            was bound to create internal problems in Turkey, make matters more
                            difficult for the Demirel Government and prevent flexibility on the
                            issue of Cyprus. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>
                            replied that only the statement issued on Wednesday, with the language
                            it contained, could have made it possible to stave off Congressional
                            statements in opposition to the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1"
                            >DCA</gloss>.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>There followed a brief review of the economic and political situation in
                            Turkey, with <persName corresp="#p_EM_1">Esenbel</persName> indicating
                            that national elections were still most likely to occur in October. The
                            conversation then passed to Cyprus. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1"
                                >Vance</persName> said he hoped all the parties to the Cyprus
                            dispute could find a way to move the situation toward an equitable
                            solution. He said he was happy to see that Turkish Cypriot leader
                                <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> had taken the
                            initiative in proposing a meeting with <persName corresp="#p_M3_1"
                                >Makarios</persName> and hoped that the meeting would take place and
                            serve as a basis for additional talks between the two Cypriot
                            leaders.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_EM_1">Esenbel</persName> said that the
                                <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> letter, a copy of
                            which he handed to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>,
                            represented an initiative which had the strong backing of Ankara.<note

                            for future negotiations, one of which would have to be that substantive
                            issues could only be discussed in committees or subcommittees. The first
                            such committee could deal <pb n="280" facs="0313" xml:id="pg_280"/>with
                            the question of the future constitution of Cyprus, and could consider
                            which powers would be delegated to the two state regimes under a bizonal
                            federation and which would be retained by the federation itself. Once
                            agreement on these points was reached, it would then be possible to
                            consider some of <persName corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName>’
                            special ideas, such as how to assure freedom of movement. In all these
                            discussions, <persName corresp="#p_EM_1">Esenbel</persName> said, it
                            would have to be recognized that the clock could not be turned back to
                            July 1974. No one should expect complete freedom of travel or
                            residence.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_EM_1">Esenbel</persName> said that if things went
                            this far, the territorial issue could then be discussed in a separate
                            committee or subcommittee on the basis of the Brussels Agreement of
                                1975.<note n="7" xml:id="d84fn7">Reference is to the agreement
                                reached between Greece and Turkey in Brussels on May 31, 1975, that
                                problems between the two countries would be resolved by negotiations
                                and that the issue of the delimitation of the continental shelf of
                                the Aegean would be resolved by the International Court of
                                Justice.</note> All that required negotiation was the line of
                            demarcation between the two zones. There could be no discussion based on
                            percentages or attempts to move back a preconceived number of refugees.
                            Each side could produce a map, from which a general discussion could
                            proceed. <persName corresp="#p_EM_1">Esenbel</persName> thought it to be
                            essential that the Greeks present a map first, and be prepared to defend
                            why they had placed the lines where they had. The Turks could then
                            produce a map containing a counter proposal, and the give-and-take might
                            eventually produce an agreed line.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EM_1">Esenbel</persName> said that it was
                            essential that these talks, once started, be kept absolutely
                            confidential. He also thought it likely that at the first meeting,
                                <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> would again bring
                            forward a proposal for some form of provisional government which would
                            operate until a final settlement could be reached. If this were not
                            acceptable to <persName corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName>, and
                                <persName corresp="#p_EM_1">Esenbel</persName> observed that nothing
                            along these lines had been thus far, <persName corresp="#p_DR_1"
                                >Denktash</persName> would then ask <persName corresp="#p_M3_1"
                                >Makarios</persName> for a gentleman’s agreement that while
                            negotiations proceeded, the Greeks would cease their propaganda efforts
                            against Turkey in international fora. <persName corresp="#p_EM_1"
                                >Esenbel</persName> expressed doubt as to whether <persName
                                corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName> would find this acceptable,
                            but said Turkey wanted <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName>
                            to probe the Greek Cypriots on all these points.</p>
                        <p>The meeting ended with a brief discussion of US planning with respect to
                            the Cyprus issue. In response to <persName corresp="#p_EM_1"
                                >Esenbel</persName>’s questions, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1"
                                >Vance</persName> said he planned no trip to Greece or Cyprus in
                            connection with his forthcoming swing through the Middle East. As for
                            the possibility of sending an envoy to the area, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> acknowledged that this was
                            something he was thinking about but had not yet reached a final decision
                            on. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> statement.</p>

                            <salute>Dear Mr. President,</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>I would like to avail myself of the auspicious occasion of your assuming
                            the high office of President, to extend once more my sincere wishes for
                            your success, personal health and happiness. I am aware that in these
                            early days of your administration many urgent domestic and international
                            policy issues are awaiting your personal attention and devotion. I would
                            wish to hope that the future of Turkish-American Bilateral Security
                            Relations would also be considered among the priorities. My main concern
                            in inviting your considerate attention to this aspect of our
                            relationship, is in fact motivated by my firm belief in the value of
                            these ties which have served the interests of our nations for a period
                            of nearly three decades as well as the interests of the North Atlantic
                            Alliance to which we are both committed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. President, as you are aware, it is one of the main foreign policy
                            choices of Turkey to maintain its membership to the alliance and to
                            continue the bilateral security and defence relations with the United
                            States. This has been our policy in the past and we believe that it is
                            in our interest to continue such a policy in the future. However, I must
                            confess that the Congress decision to impose an arms embargo on Turkey
                            has created serious domestic difficulties for the Turkish Government in
                            upholding the credibility of the alliance and the usefulness of
                            bilateral security relationship with the United States.<note n="2"

                            avoid any further deterioration of our relations. Our joint efforts with
                            the outgoing administration produced a new Defence Cooperation Agreement
                            which aims at, above all, restoring the mutual confidence between the
                            two nations which characterize our relationship for the last three
                                decades.<note n="3" xml:id="d86fn3">See <ref

                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. President, it is certainly up to your Administration and the United
                            States Congress to determine where its country’s vital interests lie.
                            What I would like to add to your considerations is that the already
                            seriously damaged traditional and friendly Turkish-American relations
                            can hardly survive another set-back. I believe that we should all try to
                            avoid such an undesirable situation which will not only further
                            adversely affect the Turkish-American bilateral relations but also shake
                            the credibility of the alliance as a whole.</p>
                        <p>With these in mind, I am sincerely convinced that both of our countries
                            have a common and vital interest in having the Agreement to be put into
                            effect without further and unnecessary delay.</p>
                        <p>I am sure the restoration of our security ties will not only strengthen
                            Turkey’s contribution to the Alliance but will also contribute to a
                            considerable extent to the peace and stability in the area.</p>
                        <p>I thought I should bring these views to your attention in all frankness
                            at this stage of our relationship and in doing so I am exclusively
                            guided by my firm belief that, if we are equally concerned of the
                            present situation, we should both spare no effort to remedy it.</p>
                        <p>With kind regards.</p>
                        <p>Yours sincerely,</p>

                        <p>“Dear Mr. Prime Minister:</p>
                        <p>“Thank you for your message of February 11 setting forth your views on
                            the critical importance of restoring the security relationship between
                            Turkey and the United States.</p>
                        <p>“I fully share your desire that early attention be given to finding ways
                            to improve and restore the close security ties between our two countries
                            that have served both our nations so well for more than a generation.
                            The friendship between our two peoples and our partnership in the North
                            Atlantic Alliance has clearly been to the benefit of both nations. It is
                            for all these reason that I have asked one of my most trusted advisers,
                            former Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clark
                                Clifford</persName>, to undertake a special mission on my behalf to
                            the area. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> is a man
                            of broad experience and sound judgment. I hope you will speak frankly
                            with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> about your
                            concerns and that you will also discuss with him how together we might
                            work to restore the closest possible Turkish-American relationship. I
                            will look forward to receiving recommendations from Mr. <persName

                            conversation about the domestic Turkish electoral situation, in which
                                <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> affirmed that national
                            elections would likely be held in June, the discussion quickly turned to
                            the purpose of the <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName>
                            mission. <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> explained that
                            he had come to the Eastern Mediterranean to ascertain the facts about
                            the problems in the area and the attitudes of the parties. The mission
                            would then prepare a report for the President and, based on this report
                            and meetings in Washington, new policies would be formulated to cover
                            the Eastern Mediterranean. <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1"
                                >Clifford</persName> reviewed his visit <pb n="285" facs="0318"
                                xml:id="pg_285"/>to Vienna and Greece, and said that we intended

                                <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> was in Vienna

                                >Clifford</persName> had thought when he left Washington.<note n="3"

                            <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> expressed the view that
                            matters between Greece and Turkey were proceeding more smoothly in
                            recent months and he was therefore startled by <persName
                                corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName>’s special reference to these
                            issues.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> went on to insist that
                            there had been no recent change in Turkish attitudes toward Greece.
                            Turkey was not an expansionist power; nor was it pursuing aggressive
                            policies. Indeed, the present coalition in Ankara was so divided that it
                            could barely formulate or implement a foreign policy at all. <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> noted that the coalition was
                            unable to discuss Cyprus or solve Turkey’s problems with the European
                            Community. There were no visible segments of public opinion that
                            demanded an aggressive policy toward Greece. <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                >Ecevit</persName> insisted the Turkish people were not
                            adventuresome, and that the very impossibility of the Turkish Government
                            acting decisively in any area made a mockery of <persName
                                corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName>’ assertions to <persName

                            <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> said that with respect to
                            questions about an Aegean army, this was not a new development. The
                            stationing of amphibious vessels along the Aegean began in the late
                            1960s as a response to the gradual Greek military buildup on the Aegean
                            islands.</p>
                        <p>With respect to air rights issues, <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                >Ecevit</persName> said Turkey had been remiss in decades past in
                            not insisting on its rights in the Aegean. It had left air traffic
                            control to the Greeks, and Athens had taken advantage of this Turkish
                            laxness to extend naval and air control, first through the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> apparatus and then bilaterally over
                            the entire Aegean. Turkey does demand a re-evaluation of this situation
                            based on new circumstances and technology.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the Continental Shelf, <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                >Ecevit</persName> noted that Greece had been conducting
                            seismographic studies in the Aegean since 1965. Much of this exploration
                            was in areas which might logically be considered under dispute. The
                            Turks said nothing while this was going on. When <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> assumed control of the Turkish
                            Government in 1974 he said he <pb n="286" facs="0319" xml:id="pg_286"
                            />asked for negotiations with the Greek junta concerning both the air
                            space and Continental Shelf questions. The Greeks rejected this request
                            and <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> said he had no choice
                            but to send the first Turkish seismic vessel into the Aegean. In 1975
                                <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> said he had made
                            arrangements for a further exploration by a Norwegian vessel, but he
                            left office and the caretaker Turkish Government did not feel strong
                            enough to pursue this matter. Then last year, under pressure from
                                <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>, Prime Minister
                            Demirel sent the <hi rend="italic">Sismik</hi> out into the Aegean.<note

                            <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> claimed Turkey had every
                            right to take this action and that when he had been in Washington in
                            1976 he had told President <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName>,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> and Defense
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD_1">Rumsfeld</persName> that Turkey
                            wanted a full settlement of all questions connected with the Aegean, but
                            that the Greeks would not meet Turkey half way.<note n="6"

                            <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> then went on to describe
                            how the Greeks took their case in the fall of 1976 to the Security
                            Council and the World Court and both bodies came down generally more on
                            the Turkish than Greek side. It was only then, <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> claimed, that Greece accepted
                            the need for serious negotiations.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> said that he personally
                            viewed this as a hopeful development, and that a modest beginning had
                            been made in recent months. He insisted that if the two countries were
                            left alone they would eventually reach a negotiated settlement to their
                            various Aegean disputes. <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>
                            went on to say he was concerned by the slow pace of these negotiations,
                            which he claimed benefitted the Greek position. <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> said that the position of his
                            party on the Aegean was clear, and that if he won the forthcoming
                            elections he would move to speed up the negotiations with Greece. He
                            insisted, however, that Turkey had to get a fair share of Aegean
                            assets.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> went on to insist there
                            was no relationship between the Continental Shelf issue and the question
                            of Turkish aggressive intent in the Aegean. Turkey has made no claims
                            against the Greek islands. <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>
                            said he had made such an announcement publicly and would be prepared to
                            do so again at any time. The real difficulty, <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> said, was that Greece was
                            exploiting her sovereignty over the islands to make claims over the
                            entire Continental Shelf, but he concluded his presentation by saying
                            that the issue was under control, and that there was no reason to be
                            worried by the present state of Greek-Turkish differences over the
                            Aegean.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> said he would like
                            to mention two other points raised by <persName corresp="#p_CC_1"
                                >Caramanlis</persName>. The first was that <persName
                                corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName> was a moderate leader who
                            wanted to negotiate. Turkey therefore was missing an opportunity <pb
                                n="287" facs="0320" xml:id="pg_287"/>by not settling Greco-Turkish
                            problems with him. <persName corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName>
                            said he could find no interlocutor in Turkey with whom he could talk.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> said he felt that
                            there was indeed a lack of understanding between the two sides, which
                            could produce, without the fault of either, a very serious
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> said perhaps <persName
                                corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName> was right on this point and
                            that no conversation partner could emerge in Turkey until after the June
                            elections. At that point, <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>
                            said, he hoped to speak directly to <persName corresp="#p_CC_1"
                                >Caramanlis</persName> as he had tried to do when <persName
                                corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName> returned to Athens in the
                            summer of 1974. <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> repeated,
                            however, that there was no reason for Greece or any other power to fear
                            Turkish expansionism. No responsible Turkish official had advocated or
                            believed in such a course. Nor does the evidence of recent years suggest
                            that the Turks really want to expand their territory. <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> noted that Turkish forces could
                            have seized all of Cyprus in 1974 had they wanted to do so. Instead,
                                <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> said, he had sought
                            immediate negotiations and a settlement. While this had not succeeded in
                            1974, he said he hoped that after the elections he would be in a
                            position to reestablish contact with the Greeks, reach decisions at a
                            policy level and then move quickly to conclude a Cyprus settlement. In
                            this connection he suggested that the present negotiating approach,
                            whereby meetings at the technical level sought agreements which could
                            then be referred upward, was unlikely to produce real results.</p>
                        <p>In response to further questions about Cyprus from Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                >Ecevit</persName> said his party had long advocated a
                            reconciliation and final settlement. <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                >Ecevit</persName> claimed he had urged the coalition government to
                            find a solution to this problem for the past year and a half, and he had
                            never interfered, nor would he in the future, should the coalition wish
                            to move positively on this matter. The real problem lay in the makeup of
                            the coalition itself. It was his understanding that the Prime Minister
                            and Foreign Minister in recent weeks had simply bypassed their other
                            coalition partners to push for a meeting between <persName
                                corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName>. These meetings may not lead
                            to any definite results. Even if they did the matter would have to be
                            referred back to the Parliament and Turkish Government coalition, which
                            is so divided it cannot approve anything until after the Turkish
                            elections. It would be a good thing, however, if a dialogue between the
                            two Cypriot communities could be kept going between now and late summer
                            so that the new Turkish Government could merely pick up and move to
                            reach an early final settlement.</p>
                        <p>For now, it was <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>’s view that
                            the friends and allies of Turkey should do nothing but wait and see what
                            develops in the intercom<pb n="288" facs="0321" xml:id="pg_288"/>munal
                            talks in Vienna in March.<note n="7" xml:id="d88fn7">The talks took
                                place March 31–April 7. See <ref target="#d11">Document

                            active now, for there could be no expectation of immediate results.
                                <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> insisted, however,
                            that Turkey wanted a negotiated solution and wanted to establish good
                            relations with Greece as well. The desire for improving relations with
                            Greece related to <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>, but even
                            without <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>, Greece and Turkey were
                            neighbors and thus had to learn to live together. <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> observed that Turkey now has
                            good relations with all its neighbors except the one which was nominally
                            its ally. <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> said he would
                            like to make one further observation, namely, that whenever Turkey’s
                            friends in the West stay out of Greek-Turkish difficulties, the two
                            countries manage to resolve their problems peacefully. Whenever Turkey’s
                            friends become overly involved, as they did after World War I,
                            difficulties and even worse have resulted. Both nations are experienced
                            and intelligent, and they have the means to establish good relations
                            between themselves if they are left alone.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> suggested there were
                            both comforting and disturbing elements in <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                >Ecevit</persName>’s comments. He then went on to describe the
                            situation with respect to Greece, and the US-Turkish Defense Cooperation
                            Agreement. He noted with respect to Cyprus, that there had been no
                            progress in more than two and a half years. This had disturbed many in
                            the United States, who no longer were prepared to view meetings and
                            optimistic statements as evidence of movement toward a negotiated
                            settlement.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> replied that while he
                            understood the situation in Congress, it was a disturbing thought for a
                            country like Turkey, in a critical geographic situation, to observe that
                            her security might be decided by the internal politics of foreign
                            allies. It was impossible for Turkey to keep her defense relations
                            suspended for any lengthy period of time. It was disturbing also that in
                            the minds of many in the United States, Turkey exists only because
                            Greece exists. Turkey is concerned with more than Greece. It has
                            interests and concerns in the Middle East and throughout the
                            Mediterranean. It wanted to maintain strong ties with <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>, and a strong defense against the
                            Soviet Union. <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> felt that it
                            was essential that the United States try to dissociate its security
                            concerns from the quarrels between neighbors which occasionally occur

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> said that if
                            he and his mission had their way, we would have settled the Turkish-US
                            Defense Cooperation Agreement long ago. He insisted that <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> policies and actions were not focused
                            on Greece. The United States was conscious of the importance of Turkey
                                <pb n="289" facs="0322" xml:id="pg_289"/>and respected and admired
                            Turkey’s loyalty and devotion to the Western Alliance system. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> said he also respected
                                <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>’s forthrightness and
                            wanted to be equally candid in describing the situation in the United
                            States. He said that regrettable as it might seem, Cyprus did hold up
                            the US-Turkish relationship. This was reality, whether we liked it or
                            not, and he therefore expressed hope that pressure [<hi rend="italic"
                                >progress</hi>] could soon be made in moving toward a Cyprus
                            settlement. <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> said he
                            knew that such progress could not be dramatic. He knew, too, that it
                            might not occur immediately, given the Turkish electoral situation.
                            Nonetheless, he noted that such progress was in the joint interests of
                            Turkey and the United States.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> said he agreed with
                                <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> and that he and his
                            party both wanted and would work toward a Cyprus solution and better
                            Turkish relations with Greece. He said he would do so, not in the
                            interest of US-Turkish relations, but because such progress was
                            important for Greece, important for Turkey and important for the two
                            communities on Cyprus. He pledged that his party would be of help to the
                            present coalition government in any way it could with respect to Cyprus
                            and the Aegean, but he noted with regret that he did not believe the
                            present government in Turkey was in a position to request or receive
                            such assistance. He concluded his presentation by observing that perhaps
                            we would all have to await the electoral results in Turkey. In that
                            sense, early elections would help us all.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> thanked <persName

                            and said that he had much enjoyed the conversation and the chance to

                                important over the next few weeks to do nothing to bruise Turkish
                                military sensitivities further while at the same time keeping up the
                                dialogue and pressure with the Turkish political leaders. The
                                Turkish military will accept the views and initiative of their
                                political leaders on these questions during the foreseeable future.”

                        <p>Although Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> has
                            already expressed his thanks for your cordial reception during his
                            recent visit to Ankara, I wanted to write you personally to add my
                            appreciation for the courtesy and openness with which you and your
                            colleagues received my Special Representative. The time you devoted to
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName>, and the warm
                            personal relationship which he tells me developed between you, gives me
                            great hope for early and full restoration of the close ties which have
                            so long bound our two countries together.</p>
                        <p>I can assure you that when Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1"
                                >Clifford</persName> spoke out of the wealth of his own personal
                            experience of the abiding importance of <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss>, he was expressing my views as well as his own. The
                            American people place great value on Turkey’s friendship and the
                            alliance relationship we have developed and maintained together for
                            almost thirty years. In conveying to me the impressions he gained from
                            his visit to Ankara,<note n="2" xml:id="d90fn2">See <ref target="#d8"

                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> has deepened
                            my understanding of the situation in the eastern Mediterranean and of
                            the importance that must be attached to safeguarding and strengthening
                            U.S.-Turkish relations.</p>
                        <p>I was also heartened to learn, based on Secretary <persName

                            substantive proposals will be put on the table in the next round of

                            9. Before he left Washington, he wanted on behalf of the Turkish

                            of the Demirel Government for signing an agreement which had still not

                            the Turkish military faced increasing problems since its access to
                            supplies had been interrupted. <persName corresp="#p_EM_1"
                                >Esenbel</persName> said a partial solution through June had been

                                >Clark Clifford</persName> but wondered when decisions would be

                                <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> Secretary General <persName
                                corresp="#p_LJM_1">Luns</persName> took the position that the <gloss

                            without conditions because of its importance to Turkey’s position in

                        <p>The Secretary said that <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName>
                            had submitted a written report to the President, and that decisions
                            would shortly be taken so that they would be ready when Congress returns
                            from its current recess on April 18. These pending decisions would
                            include both suggested 1978 military aid levels for Turkey and possibly
                            also endorsement of the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> in

                            <persName corresp="#p_EM_1">Esenbel</persName> said his government hoped
                            for the strongest possible statement to make clear the support of the
                            Administration for the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>. He recalled
                            he had recently discussed timing with <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clark
                                Clifford</persName>(State 71604) who had said that soundings with
                            Congress would help determine when conditions were ripe for movement on

                                    >Clifford</persName> stated that his trip reinforced his

                                relationship and of Turkey’s place in the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                    >NATO</gloss> Alliance, but that he did not feel that the

                        <p>The Secretary said we could not be more precise about timing at this
                            stage. Priority attention was being given to the 1978 security
                            assistance legislation. <persName corresp="#p_EM_1">Esenbel</persName>
                            asked if the Administration could say that Congress should take up the
                                <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> as soon as it completed work on
                            the 1978 aid bill. The Secretary replied that the most we could do in
                            the near future, if we reach that decision, was to indicate the
                            Administration’s endorsement in principle of the <gloss

                            <persName corresp="#p_EM_1">Esenbel</persName> said he had recently
                            talked with a number of Senators and Congressmen. He thought the Senate
                            would support the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> now. He agreed
                            with the Secretary’s observation that the situation in the Senate was
                            better than in the House. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ_1"
                                >Sparkman</persName> had told him that if the Administration gives

                            <persName corresp="#p_MGS_1">McGovern</persName> had told the Ambassador
                            he was now open-minded and realized he had made a mistake in supporting

                                >Esenbel</persName> in January that the Administration wanted to

                            Cypriot map with four zones was quite unacceptable. The Secretary said
                            he thought getting a map on the table was at least a start. He felt that
                            the Turkish Cypriot proposal was not as forthcoming as one could have
                            expected either. <persName corresp="#p_EM_1">Esenbel</persName> said it
                            could be perfected; in any event a federal system for Cyprus would have
                            to take account of the realities of the island. It could not be
                            patterned on the Swiss or American models. The Secretary said he
                            understood the problem but clearly both sides had a ways to go.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_EM_1">Esenbel</persName> thought that a settlement
                            would take time since with all Turkish good will Archbishop Makarios
                            would probably again change his position. But in any event Cyprus should
                            not get in the way of US-Turkish military cooperation.</p>

                            their feet. The Secretary said he had taken note of this Turkish

                            Turkey on Aegean issues. <persName corresp="#p_EM_1">Esenbel</persName>
                            recalled the November 1976 Bern agreement on the continental shelf, but
                            said the Greeks by insisting on technical-level expert discussions were
                            adopting a procedural approach rather than trying to find a
                                solution.<note n="7" xml:id="d91fn7">Reference is to an agreement
                                reached between Greek and Turkish officials in talks during November

                                of the agreement included a list of pledges undertaken by both sides
                                to ensure that future negotiations would be kept confidential and
                                that neither country would undertake an action that would threaten
                                the prestige of the other. (Telegram 12453 from Athens, November 22,

                            “political” effort to find a compromise was essential. The two foreign
                            ministers would meet at the Council of Europe meeting in Strasbourg
                            later this month. In response to the Secretary’s question as to whether
                            there was any chance of movement before the Turkish elections, Esenbel
                            said there might be more meetings at the technical level and <persName

                                >Tzounis</persName> might meet again in Bern on the continental
                            shelf question. An agreement on airspace issues had been close but the
                            Greeks had shifted their position.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked if it would do any good if we encouraged them to
                            move. <persName corresp="#p_EM_1">Esenbel</persName> said that would be
                            helpful although the US should not try to come up with a solution. It
                            would be very useful if we encouraged a political settlement. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> recalled that Greece
                            and Turkey interpreted differently the Bern agreement, particularly the
                            function of the legal experts. <persName corresp="#p_EM_1"
                                >Esenbel</persName> agreed that the legal experts could serve useful
                            purpose, but they could not solve what was an important political
                            problem. The Secretary agreed that it seemed to him that the complex
                            Aegean issues could best be settled on political grounds.</p>

                        <p>We have held up submitting proposals to the Congress concerning our
                            security assistance relationship with Turkey pending a full evaluation
                            of <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clark Clifford</persName>’s
                            recommendations and an assessment of the Cyprus talks in Vienna. The
                            results of those talks are now in hand. The Turks did fulfill their
                            promise to <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> to put a
                            constitutional proposal for Cyprus on the table, but the contents of
                            that document were disappointing as was the Turkish Cypriot response to
                            the Greek Cypriot territorial proposal. As a consequence the negotiating
                            round in Vienna, though far from a failure, went less well than we had
                            hoped.</p>
                        <p>Given Congressional appreciation of this fact, the continuing inclination
                            in Congress to link the level of security assistance to Turkey with
                            progress on Cyprus, and the need to let the Turks know that we expect
                            them to be more forthcoming in the Cyprus negotiations, I believe, and
                                <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clark Clifford</persName> agrees, that
                            we should cut back somewhat on <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1"
                                >Clifford</persName>’s previous recommendations.</p>
                        <p>It is important, however, that our proposals (a) demonstrate the
                            importance of our alliance relationship, and give the Turks increased
                            capacity to meet their <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                            commitments, (b) signal our dissatisfaction with the minimal performance
                            of the Turkish Cypriots in Vienna, yet (c) give the Turks a sufficient
                            level of assistance to provide an incentive for further cooperation in
                            the search for a negotiated Cyprus solution.</p>
                        <p>I would accordingly propose that we move as follows with respect to
                            Turkey:</p>
                        <p>1. Endorse in principle the U.S.-Turkish Defense Cooperation Agreement of
                            March 1976, but not press for Congressional approval at this time. This
                            is exactly in line with <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1"
                            >Clifford</persName>’s previous recommendation.</p>
                        <p>2. Recommend to Congress Foreign Military Sales financing for Turkey for
                                <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1978 of up to $160 million. This
                            is $15 million less than <pb n="297" facs="0330" xml:id="pg_297"/>the
                            original <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> recommendation
                            but $35 million more than in 1977. The Turks will be dissatisfied with
                            the reduction from <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName>’s
                            recommendation but will not seriously object. The reduction may help to
                            convince some in Congress to accept the entire package.</p>
                        <p>3. Seek a modification of the current ceiling on Foreign Military Sales
                            transactions with Turkey so that, in addition to sales up to the $160
                            million financing level discussed in the previous paragraph, Turkey
                            could also finish procurement of forty F–4 aircraft for which two
                            contracts have already been signed. This relaxation is much less than
                                <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clark Clifford</persName> originally
                            recommended. All other restrictions on Turkey contained in existing
                            legislation would continue in effect.</p>
                        <p>I plan to outline this program in the next few days to the leadership of
                            Congress and to those particularly concerned with Cyprus, Greece and
                            Turkey. Formal testimony on the Turkish assistance package will begin
                            before subcommittees of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the
                            House International Relations Committees on April 21 at which we will
                            support the Greek security assistance package of $175 million for <gloss

                        <p>We will seek to work with Congressional leaders so as to avoid any fight
                            on the Turkish assistance program. The compromise package outlined above
                            should satisfy most members of Congress. At the same time, it is
                            important to be aware that those most closely associated with Greece in
                            the Congress may find a program which gives any assistance to Turkey
                            unacceptable. We thus may face a fight, but if we do, I believe we can
                            win as our position is justifiably moderate and in the country’s and
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>’s long-term interest.

                        <p>This program is the minimum necessary to assist Turkey with its security
                            needs and to preserve Turkish cooperation in the future, as well as to

                                stated that the Turkish Government fears that it may be unable to
                                meet its financial obligations if foreign bankers liquidate their
                                Turkish lira accounts. The item added that the government hopes to
                                stave off a politically damaging payments crisis by borrowing
                                abroad. It has approached the First National City Bank of New York
                                for a $300 million loan and intends to sound out the <gloss

                        </list>
                        <p>Turkey’s foreign exchange reserves have been declining gradually for a
                            long time. Recently, however, the rate of decline has accelerated. We
                            are now beginning to get reports of foreign banks denying letters of
                            credit to the Turkish Central Bank, but it is difficult to know how
                            drastic the problem is until more information comes in. Meanwhile, it is
                            clear that some of Turkey’s financial authorities are urgently exploring
                            ways to build up their reserves: loans from abroad, quick sales of
                            agricultural commodities from stockpiles, transfer of workers’ deposits
                            from Germany. The situation has worsened at a very awkward time for
                            Demirel, who has had good luck in managing Turkey’s finances over the
                            past two years and hoped to benefit from this record in the elections
                            which take place on 5 June.</p>
                        <p>The problem is not basic unsoundness. Over the past six years, Turkey has
                            had one of the best sustained economic growth rates in the world. The
                            precarious political balance in the country, where proportional
                            representation keeps producing weak coalitions, has prevented
                            governments from taking firm measures to put the country’s finances on a
                            sound long-term basis. Instead, short-term high-interest loans from
                            foreign banks have been used to keep reserves up. This short-term
                            indebtedness needs to be converted into medium or long-term loans. This
                            is difficult to do in the midst of a heated election campaign. Demirel
                            was hoping he could get by without having to face the problem yet. He
                            may still be able to.</p>
                        <pb n="299" facs="0332" xml:id="pg_299"/>
                        <p>Turkey has no place to turn except Western bankers and governments for
                            help with its financial problems. When she needed similar help in the
                            1960’s, several of her <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> allies
                            joined to refinance her indebtedness and the arrangement paid off
                            handsomely. A similar arrangement is quite conceivable now, but it would
                            have to be accompanied by domestic austerity measures which would slow
                            economic growth and force cutbacks in social services and long-term
                            development projects. (In other words, Turkey would have to accept
                            commitments like those the British have agreed to in return for loans
                            and concessions.) These measures can only be taken by a strong
                            government. If either <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> or
                            Demirel wins a working majority on 5 June, prospects for working out
                            these problems will be good. If the elections are indecisive, Turkey is
                            likely to degenerate into political and financial crisis.</p>
                        <p>There is no way the present financial problems of Turkey could be
                            exploited to make the Turks more forthcoming on Cyprus. Any hint that we
                            were trying to do so would, in this tense election period, unleash a
                            wave of nationalist protesting that would rile up the political
                            situation and make the outcome of the elections even more uncertain than
                            it is. After the elections, Turkey’s need for friends who can help her
                            sort out her indebtedness and get her financial affairs in order for the
                            long haul will in all likelihood encourage her leaders to move to settle
                            current political problems such as Cyprus and relations with Greece.</p>

                            There is a problem in the Aegean. We want to strengthen our ties with

                            peace and friendship with Turkey. This is very important. How can we
                            improve US-Turkish and Turkish-Greek relations? We would not interfere,
                            but are available to help.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">The Prime Minister</hi> thanked the President very
                            much. He will express his deep concern, and should report the facts.
                            Turkey and the United States are good, loyal friends. There had been
                            three decades of common cause. Turkey is a free and independent
                            democracy, which keeps the flag of democracy flying. Turkey is
                            surrounded by communist countries and others, and is more democratic
                            than they are. They share the values of the West, and will definitely
                            defend democracy for the Turkish people.</p>
                        <p>Turkey is in a place that, if Turkey has troubles, it is difficult to
                            repair them, no matter how much effort is made. The Soviet Union has not
                            changed its goals of more than 300 years. It wants access to the sea,
                            and now to the oil areas. Turkey is a handicap for the Soviet Union,
                            which is not able to go out to the outside world. There is no problem in
                            the Mediterranean with the Soviet Union, and he hoped there would not
                            be. Turkey is trying to develop, and has “done good.” Despite troubles,
                            it has kept the idea and the institutions of democracy. Soon it would
                            have elections.</p>
                        <p>They are trying to build their country, and defeat poverty. If they can
                            solve this problem, it will prove that democracy is not a handicap for
                            development. No other developing country had been as successful as
                            Turkey in the past 30 years.</p>

                            Demirel should get great credit for it. We had increased from $125 to
                            $175 million the authority to sell arms to Turkey. This is a move in the
                            right direction. It should be seen in Turkey as progress and a victory,
                            not as a defeat. This would help the President and our friendship with
                            Turkey. It is a tribute to Demirel that the figure has been increased.
                            His guess is that Congress will approve it.</p>
                        <p>There is a problem for the United States and Turkey. There are difficult
                            relations with the Congress after Vietnam. We have strict laws on the
                            use of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> weapons that we supply.
                            There are deep feelings about Cyprus. Congress feels that, against
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> law, weapons were used by
                            Turkey in Cyprus. We must dissipate this feeling.</p>
                        <p>He is determined that the military agreement with Turkey will be
                            approved, and thinks it will be. But Congress will not act before
                            alleviation of the situation on Cyprus. He knows how deeply Demirel
                            feels about not linking the issues. We can’t mislead Demirel: without
                            progress on Cyprus, the Congressional view is that there needs to be a
                            rectification of the use of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            weapons, against <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> law. Otherwise,
                            the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> will not be approved. He has
                            good hopes for it. He has spent hours trying to understand how to push
                            Congress. It would be serious for relations with Turkey if the <gloss
                                target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> came to a vote and were rejected by
                            Congress. He wants to make sure that when the vote is taken, it will be
                            “yes.”</p>
                        <p>He hopes for some expression from Turkey: not critical because there is
                            no <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>, but appreciating the progress
                            made on the increase in military sales. This would show that the two
                            countries can work together, and value one another’s friendship.</p>
                        <p>He is pleased that Turkey had tabled a proposal on Cyprus. Demirel has
                            influence with the Turkish Cypriots. If progress is demonstrated, then
                            this would remove problems with the Congress.</p>
                        <p>Turkish friendship is crucial to the United States, as it was at the time
                            of the Korean War, when Turkey stood shoulder to shoulder with us, when
                            we almost stood alone. We will never forget this. The close friendship
                            goes back to the time when President <persName corresp="#p_THS_1"
                                >Truman</persName> provided aid to Turkey—not as a gift, but as an
                            investment. It was a good investment for the United States, and paid
                            rich dividends. He is proud of Turkey’s strength, its courage vis-a-vis
                            the Soviet Union, and its commitment to democracy. If public statements
                            stress disappointment and criticism and condemnation, then this will
                            make progress difficult with Congress.</p>
                        <p>He knows how deeply Demirel feels about the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1"
                                >DCA</gloss>. He hopes that Demirel will let him deal with Congress
                            in a way to bring results, not a negative reaction. If the vote were
                            held now, it would be negative. If <pb n="303" facs="0336"
                                xml:id="pg_303"/>there is progress on Cyprus, he can assure Demirel
                            that the vote will be positive. He needs Demirel’s help. He wants to
                            restore complete friendship between the United States and Turkey.</p>

                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">handling restriction not declassified</hi>] During the
                            2 years which have elapsed since the US arms embargo was imposed in
                            February 1975, Turkey has been attempting to reduce the traditional
                            dependence of its armed forces on US military equipment. Turkish efforts
                            to develop alternate sources of arms have taken four basic forms:</p>
                        <p>—attempting to acquire arms, through either purchase or foreign aid, from
                            other <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> members;</p>
                        <p>—increasing domestic arms production;</p>
                        <p>—investigating the possibilities of cooperation with other Muslim states
                            and of direct purchase from non-NATO countries; and</p>
                        <p>—exploring the possibility of obtaining arms from the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>Although the Turks have had some success in locating non-US sources, the
                            overall result of the effort has probably convinced them that there is
                            no source or combination of sources which can satisfactorily replace the
                            US for some time to come.</p>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">handling restriction not declassified</hi>] Meanwhile,
                            the embargo has caused serious difficulties for the Turkish forces,
                            particularly the air force, at a time when Greece is significantly
                            improving the quality of its forces through the introduction of new US
                            and French equipment. Turkey’s acquisition of F–4s since the partial
                            lifting of the embargo has only partly alleviated the situation. [<hi

                            after determined efforts to persuade the British to join Turkey in

                            exploited the Cyprus operation to make himself a national hero. His
                            popularity was enormously high when he resigned in September 1974 to rid
                            himself of his reactionary coalition partner, <persName

                            would like to do what <persName corresp="#p_AMK_2">Ataturk</persName>
                            did with Venizelos in the 1920’s: settle Greek-Turkish strife so both

                            strength to deal substantively with difficult issues. It claimed to be
                            doing so in economic matters, and said it could do so with respect to
                            Cyprus. These claims still need to be tested.</p>
                        <p>We presented a basic message: the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            was a friend of Turkey, not an antagonist. We had common goals:
                            restoration of good bilateral relations; strengthening of <gloss

                            by establishing a bizonal, federal state. Since we both wanted the same
                            results, we should work together on a scenario of actions to be taken
                            during the next few months so that our goals could be accomplished. We
                            would try to take account of their political situation; they in turn
                            must understand our political needs.</p>
                        <p>When it became clear that this approach was striking a responsive chord,
                            we gave them some concrete ideas. We emphasized that these were
                            preliminary ideas being floated on the working level to see whether they
                            believed something along these lines would be feasible. Attached is a

                                Eastern Mediterranean.</note> I should say that, on the
                            sub-ministerial level, we were told that a number of these ideas would
                            probably be acceptable—but there were no commitments (and some
                            expressions of difficulty) with respect to the more important items.
                            These should be further explored when Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName> arrives in New York. (He
                            is bringing his senior staff who will meet with us in Washington before
                            your meeting.)</p>
                        <p>I believe that we are now at a critical point in our relations with
                            Turkey. We can no longer claim to be a new Administration “studying” the
                            problem; on their side, elections have been held and a government is in
                            place. The opportunity presented now could be seized upon to save the
                            relationship and also to initiate a new phase in the Cyprus
                            negotiations. On the other hand, if this opportunity is lost, I see only
                            a deteriorating security relationship, with adverse implications for
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>, and also no real chance for
                            movement on Cyprus any time in the near future.</p>
                        <p>Our goal was always to use the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> as
                            leverage for concessions on Cyprus. I believe that if the Turks accept a
                            scenario such as the one we explored in Ankara, we will have succeeded
                            in our goal.</p>
                        <p>I am sure that some will argue that we should hold out for still more.
                            After nine months working steadily on this issue, it is my judgment that
                            the type of Turkish undertakings represented by the attached scenario
                            represents about the best that can be gotten. There is no chance of
                            getting a signed and sealed Cyprus agreement any time soon—if only
                            because of the political vacuum created by Archbishop Makarios’
                                death.<note n="5" xml:id="d98fn5">Makarios died on August 3.</note>
                            In other words, to hold out for more would probably mean getting nothing
                            on Cyprus—and losing perhaps our best chance to salvage our security
                            relationship with Turkey.</p>
                        <p>We must wait to see whether the major elements of this package will be
                            accepted by the Turks. Our conversations were with the most positive,
                            pro-Western men in the Foreign Ministry; they will have their problems
                            with their political leadership. Before we hear from them, however, I
                            believe we must get a better sense of how this Administration wants to
                            handle the Turkish relationship; namely, whether this Administration
                            would agree to push the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> on the Hill
                            during the next six months under a scenario of this kind.</p>
                        <p>Let me add to this memorandum a few fundamentals about the Eastern
                            Mediterranean problem:</p>
                        <pb n="311" facs="0344" xml:id="pg_311"/>
                        <p>1. The deterioration of Turkey’s military establishment caused by the
                            embargo has reached critical levels. Most experts believe it will take
                            up to a decade to bring the Turkish armed forces up to <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> standards. Our Military Attaches in
                            both Athens and Ankara believe that Greece has now overtaken Turkey
                            militarily, at least in the air and sea. This has the Turks worried. It
                            also means that the Turkish <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> is no
                            threat to Greece.</p>
                        <p>2. The situation in Cyprus has changed radically with Makarios’ death.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> may or may not stay
                            on as President in the February elections, but the important fact is
                            that no leader will have the personal charisma or the political base to
                            negotiate, much less sell, a settlement in the next months to the Greek
                            Cypriots.</p>
                        <p>3. This power vacuum on Cyprus places a new burden on Greece. Given the
                            politics of Cyprus, no agreement can be sold on the island without
                            Greece’s seal of approval. Therefore, it is important that the Greeks be
                            brought into the negotiating process—either formally or informally. The
                            Turks independently have also reached this conclusion. Greece, however,
                            will be reluctant to participate, for Cyprus is a political liability.
                            Greek leaders have expressed this attitude repeatedly. We believe that
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> involvement might help to
                            overcome Greek reluctance to participating.</p>
                        <p>4. The intercommunal talks under <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1"
                                >Waldheim</persName> are the central mechanism for the negotiations,
                            since they are a <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>-established means of
                            bringing Greek and Turkish Cypriots together on the basis of equality.
                            However, the intercommunal talks cannot by themselves negotiate a
                            settlement. First, neither Greece nor Turkey are represented at the
                            table, and their presence is vital. Second, everything said at those
                            meetings is leaked to the press. Third, the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss> mechanism lacks the authority or political force to move
                            the talks forward.</p>
                        <p>5. For these reasons it seems obvious that third-party involvement is
                            required—behind the scenes, confidential interchanges in support of, and
                            as a supplement to, the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> process. The
                            United States is the obvious—perhaps only—choice. (Joint US-British or
                            US–EC–9 are possible alternatives.) The Greek Cypriots have already put
                            their trust in us—they want us to mediate and know that only the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> has the influence to move the Turks.
                            Greece, too, might be willing to become engaged if it knows that we will
                            be playing an important role. Now, if Turkey will also invite us to
                            serve in a mediating capacity, we will have the moral and political
                            authority to work effectively for a real solution to the Cyprus problem.
                            However, their wounded pride and Turkish political realities make it
                            impossible for them to permit the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            to play a defined and visible role while our embargo is in effect. I
                            think the Turks can be persuaded to accept our involvement, but only
                            after the embargo is lifted. The attached scenario is built upon this
                            premise.</p>

                            progress in the months ahead. END SUMMARY</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he had reviewed the reports Counselor <persName
                                corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> had submitted following his
                            return from Ankara and his meetings with Secretary General <persName
                                corresp="#p_ES_1">Elekdag</persName> this past week in Washington.
                            Progress had clearly been made in developing a possible joint work
                            program, and before Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1"
                                >Caglayangil</persName> returned to Turkey it was the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> hope that a solid basis for progress
                            could be established.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName>
                            responded with a lengthy monolog which began with some probing questions
                            about Turkish and <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> ob<pb n="313"
                                facs="0346" xml:id="pg_313"/>jectives. It had been the Turkish hope,
                            said <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName>, to reach full
                            agreement on a joint series of steps to strengthen Turkish-<gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> relations. Instead, all that had been
                            produced thus far was a paper reflecting the differing perspective of
                            the two sides.<note n="2" xml:id="d99fn2">Not found.</note> The question
                            therefore arose as to whether we were proceeding in the right

                            wonderful <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Turkish ties had suffered
                            as a result of an arms embargo imposed by the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> To overcome that embargo, Turkey had negotiated a new
                            Defense Cooperation Agreement (<gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>)
                            with the United States. No one had forced the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> to sign that agreement, but having done so, all that
                            Turkey now asked was that this agreement be ratified by the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Congress.</p>
                        <p>The Turkish Foreign Minister said it had been his assumption that the
                            United States had begun a dialogue with Turkey recently in an effort to
                            find a way to implement the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> and
                            thus restore the overall <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Turkish
                            relationship. The point of the exercise was not, said <persName
                                corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName>, to find a solution to the
                            Cyprus problem. Even if Turkey gave the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> a full power of attorney with respect to this issue,
                            the problem could not be solved in October or November of 1977. Numerous
                            difficulties stood in the way of progress on Cyprus. There was now no
                            government on the Greek Cypriot side of the island capable of assuming
                            the responsibilities for negotiating and implementing a settlement. The
                            Greek government also had no incentive to find a solution and was now
                            entering an electoral period of its own. Under these circumstances,
                                <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName> asked
                            rhetorically, why was the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> focusing
                            on Cyprus? Did we want to carve out a role for ourselves? What indeed
                            was the purpose of asking for specific steps now from Turkey with
                            respect to Cyprus? <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName>
                            said he hoped our requests were aimed at providing ammunition—not to
                            convince the Administration of Turkish goodwill, but rather to help the
                            Administration convince the Congress that the embargo had been in error
                            and that the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> should now be passed.
                            If this was, in fact, the Administration’s motive, then Turkey was
                            certain the Administration would be successful and was willing therefore
                            to be of assistance in the process by taking certain joint steps with
                            the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        </p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName>,
                            reading from the draft list of possible joint actions, then outlined
                            what Turkey would be prepared to do. He said his government could issue
                            a series of statements at the highest level, indicating Turkish support
                            for the intercommunal negotiating process and its willingness to play a
                            more active role in efforts aimed at achieving a Cyprus settlement. He
                            said Turkey might also be prepared <pb n="314" facs="0347"
                                xml:id="pg_314"/>to withdraw some further troops from the island.
                            Turkey was also willing to discuss all aspects of a Cyprus settlement at
                            any forum which might be convened. Ankara could also provide assurances
                            against unilateral actions in northern Cyprus which might interfere with
                            the negotiating process. Finally, <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1"
                                >Caglayangil</persName> said Turkey would be prepared to participate
                            directly with Greece to help bring about a Cyprus settlement, and could
                            make a public statement to that effect.</p>
                        <p>With respect to a future Cypriot constitution, <persName
                                corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName> said this was a matter
                            that had to be resolved by the two communities on the island through the
                            negotiating process. It would not be useful for Turkey or the Turkish
                            Cypriots, or even the two working together with western experts to
                            formulate a concrete constitutional plan and then give it in advance to
                            the Greeks or the Greek Cypriots. The general outlines of a future
                            constitution had already been presented by the Turkish Cypriots last
                            April in Vienna. It provided for a loose federation, with certain key
                            powers such as foreign affairs reserved for the central government.<note

                            <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName> said that as long as
                            the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> embargo was in place, it was
                            difficult to consider a direct <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> role
                            in such specific issues as a future constitution for Cyprus. It was even
                            more difficult to envisage the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            assuming a role as mediator. Even if Turkey were to agree to such a
                            role, this would not help the negotiating process. Indeed, such a <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> role would create a whole series of
                            new problems in an area where there were already more than enough
                            difficulties. The fact was, said <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1"
                                >Caglayangil</persName>, that the current negotiating procedures had
                            not, in fact, broken down. What was needed was not a new forum, but a
                            way to bridge the existing gap on substantive issues between the two
                            Cypriot communities.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName> said that he assumed
                            that when our two staffs had talked about a more active <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> role, this was conceived as a means to
                            assist the Administration convince Congress that progress on Cyprus was
                            being made. Why was a more active <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            involvement necessary? The <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> already
                            had a role through the mission given to Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName>. This could continue.
                            Moreover, the Turkish government was always willing to provide full
                            information to the American side on negotiating developments. Turkey
                            could not do more than that.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName> concluded by
                            insisting that the draft action paper had made abundantly clear what the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> expected from Turkey; and that
                            what was far less clear was what Turkey could expect from the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Turkey needed to know when the <gloss
                                target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> would be ratified. It needed to know
                            how the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> planned to reorder <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Turkish relations. What <pb n="315"
                                facs="0348" xml:id="pg_315"/>help would we provide in the economic
                            sphere? Finally, <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName>
                            said he wished to bring to the Secretary’s attention the fact that a
                            Turkish journalist had received information from the State Department
                            that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and Turkey were discussing
                            certain practical steps, including a possible Turkish troop reduction
                            from Cyprus. This kind of disclosure endangered the entire negotiating
                            process now under discussion. This, said <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1"
                                >Caglayangil</persName>, underscored the importance of finding a
                            solution to the entire publicity problem, which had long plagued the
                            Cyprus negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> thanked the
                            Turkish Foreign Minister for his presentation and said he would like to
                            answer some of the basic questions which the Turkish side had raised.
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> objectives, said the Secretary,
                            were clear: to find a means to improve <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss>-Turkish relations, and get them back to where they
                            were in the past. The <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> recognized
                            that an important factor in achieving this goal is Congressional
                            approval of the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>. The <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Administration would like to see this
                            accomplished at an early date. The Secretary said he wished to be frank
                            on this point. If the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Government
                            were to put the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> forward before
                            there was clear-cut support for the document, and the <gloss
                                target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> were defeated by the Congress, this
                            could set back <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Turkish relations
                            for a long time. Thus, the Administration had to be careful before
                            embarking on the important step of urging Congress to vote on the <gloss
                                target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>. The Secretary said he knew that it
                            was a matter of principle to the Turkish government that there could be
                            no linkage between Cyprus and the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss>-Turkish security relationship. Unfortunately, such a
                            linkage existed in the minds of many members of Congress. Therefore, it
                            was our judgment that progress on Cyprus was needed to get the <gloss
                                target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> passed. It is this progress that we
                            have been trying to achieve. Because <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> efforts thus far had not been successful, we hoped the
                            joint exercise underway these past weeks might create the right
                            atmosphere to move forward on both the Cyprus issue and the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> security relationship.</p>
                        <p>When <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName> confirmed that
                            this also corresponded to Turkish objectives, the Secretary said he
                            found many positive elements in the joint <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss>-Turkish paper. It should be clear, however, that the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> had no desire to play the role
                            of mediator, or to get too far out front of the Cyprus negotiations. Our
                            only interest was in seeing to it that progress was made.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he wished to talk to the President about this entire
                            set of issues and then see Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1"
                                >Caglayangil</persName> a second time to go over in even greater
                            detail the action program now under discussion.</p>
                        <p>The discussion then turned briefly to the question of Turkish Cypriot
                            leader <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName>’s role in any
                            future negotiations. When the Secretary inquired as to whether <persName
                                corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> was flexible and willing to
                                <pb n="316" facs="0349" xml:id="pg_316"/>enter into serious
                            negotiations, <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName>
                            responded that <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> had both
                            internal problems and his own ambition. The Turkish Cypriot leader was
                            also unhappy about the present situation in which his government lacked
                            any form of international respectability. <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1"
                                >Caglayangil</persName> noted that the <gloss target="#t_PLO_1"
                                >PLO</gloss> had an observer in New York and that in all fairness,
                                <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> deserved similar
                            treatment.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName> suggested that the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> change its approach to
                                <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> as a means of
                            moderating <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName>’s attitudes.
                            This in turn would help the Turkish government control and contain
                                <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName>, <persName
                                corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName> noting that while Turkey
                            could hold <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName>’s hand, it
                            could not close his mouth.</p>
                        <p>Counselor <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> said the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> had already assisted the Turkish
                            Cypriot community, but was looking into ways in which further help might
                            be provided. There were problems in this area, and it was our basic view
                            that <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> was a Turkish and
                            not a <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> problem.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he knew <persName corresp="#p_DR_1"
                                >Denktash</persName> personally and had great respect for him. But
                            he also knew the Turkish Cypriot leader could be rigid and at times
                            difficult to deal with. The Turkish Foreign Minister agreed, and said if
                            the Secretary knew <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName>, he
                            certainly understood the problems the Turkish government faced in
                            seeking to control him.</p>
                        <p>In summing up the conversation, the Secretary said the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> was interested in real progress in
                            resolving the Cyprus problem, and not in cosmetic steps aimed at
                            satisfying Congress. We also agreed that the intercommunal talks will
                            get nowhere without the direct and active participation of Greece and
                            Turkey.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he very much regretted the press leak which apparently
                            occurred, and said he had no objection to a draft press statement which
                            Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName>
                            circulated and said he wished to use at the conclusion of the meeting to
                            dim press speculation about the contents of the discussion.</p>
                        <p>The meeting concluded with the Turkish Foreign Minister agreeing that if
                            Greece can be persuaded to participate directly in future talks, this
                            would immeasurably assist Turkey in controlling <persName
                                corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName>. He also said he very much
                            welcomed the idea of a second meeting with the Secretary, after the
                            Secretary had spoken with President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"

                        <p>The restricted meeting extended for more than one hour and contained a
                            great deal of repetition of past positions taken by the Turks. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> made it dramatically
                            clear to <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName> that we had
                            to have all the help we could get to move the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1"
                                >DCA</gloss> through the Congress. He informed <persName
                                corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName> that the President was
                            going to have to have the Secretary’s and <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1"
                                >Clifford</persName>’s assurance that the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1"
                                >DCA</gloss> would pass before he would send it to the Congress with
                            his recommendation that it be approved.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName> insisted that his
                            government has recently decided on a clear and unequivocal policy to
                            settle the Cyprus issue. Cyprus had caused Turkey great difficulty, both
                            from an economic standpoint and in terms of Turkey’s image in the world.
                            The Cyprus operation had been very expensive and one of the practical
                            reasons a solution was indicated was that it could save Turkey a
                            substantial amount of money.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName> was questioned in
                            detail about Turkey’s position and in all his replies <persName
                                corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName> sought to convey the
                            impression that Turkey was prepared to take whatever action was
                            necessary to obtain a Cyprus settlement. Turkey well understood the
                            importance of Cyprus as compared to the importance of its bilateral
                            relationship with the United States and the healthy continuance of the
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> Alliance. He indicated that
                            he thought that in the Turkish Government’s policy review, Cyprus had
                            been placed in its proper perspective.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the details of a Cyprus settlement, <persName
                                corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName> estimated that a fair and
                            equitable division would result in 32 percent going to the
                            Turkish-Cypriots. He said that were he asked whether or <pb n="318"
                                facs="0351" xml:id="pg_318"/>not he had ever made a comment to this
                            effect to the Secretary, he wanted to be on notice in advance that he
                            would have to be at liberty to deny it. Makarios had put forward a map
                            that would have allotted the Turkish-Cypriots about 20 percent of the
                            island, and Makarios had let it be known that there might be flexibility
                            in the Greek-Cypriot position up to 25 percent. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> asked <persName
                                corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName> as to whether the Turks
                            were prepared to be flexible in their 32 percent figure. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName> replied affirmatively but
                            suggested it was a mistake to deal in percentages. A number of special
                            situations existed on the island that had to be taken into account; this
                            could be done if both sides approached the problem in an atmosphere of
                            goodwill.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> asked what
                                <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName> thought should
                            be done with Varosha. <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1"
                                >Caglayangil</persName> replied equivocally. He said further
                            negotiations were required, that there were both Greek and Turkish
                            interests there that had to be taken into account, but that in the final
                            analysis an equitable settlement could be arranged.</p>
                        <p>Proceeding to the next area of discussion, Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> asked what Turkey’s ideas were
                            with reference to the structure of the new government of Cyprus.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName> dismissed this
                            airily with a wave of his hand. He said that this was absolutely no
                            problem, and wasn’t worth taking the time to discuss. All sides
                            appreciated in general terms the kind of government that would have to
                            be created, and <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName>
                            foresaw little difficulty in the parties reaching an agreement on this
                            subject. He indicated that Turkey did not intend to take a stiff
                            position in this area and maintain it adamantly so as to impact
                            adversely on the prospects for an early settlement.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName> said in this
                            connection that at some point Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1"
                                >Vance</persName> should invite <persName corresp="#p_DR_1"
                                >Denktash</persName> to the United States. This might occur after
                            the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> had been passed by the
                            Congress, if that proved to be the policy of the US Government. Such a
                            visit would mean a great deal to <persName corresp="#p_DR_1"
                                >Denktash</persName> and the Turkish-Cypriots, and would add
                            immeasurably to the ease of working with <persName corresp="#p_DR_1"
                                >Denktash</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName> got into a long discussion
                            regarding specific words connected with the draft paper under
                            consideration. Instead of attempting to have a definitive written
                            instrument that would set forth specifically what each side would do,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> stated that he
                            would have a memo prepared which he would submit to President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d100fn2"

                                found.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName> replied that he
                            would prepare a memo and submit it to Prime Minister Demirel and the
                            Turkish Cabinet. Each agreed to present the problem to their respective
                            leaders along with <pb n="319" facs="0352" xml:id="pg_319"/>their
                            personal opinion that the course of action agreed upon would lead to the
                            settlement of Cyprus and the passage of the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1"
                                >DCA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The understanding between the parties was based upon the joint
                            realization that the settlement of the Cyprus question would lead to the
                            passage of the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> and the passage of
                            the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> would lead to the settlement of
                            the Cyprus question. Each side indicated that the efforts by both
                            parties would take place concurrently but that there was no way to set
                            condition precedents for later action. Both understood this to mean that
                            our two governments had reached an understanding that, assuming higher
                            approval, the United States would move in good faith for the passage of
                            the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> and that those in the
                            Administration who had the responsibility would seek to persuade people
                            by conveying our considered opinion that the settlement of Cyprus was
                            well on its way.</p>
                        <p>This kind of approach appealed very much to both the Secretary and
                            Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName>.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName> promised to
                            inform his government in this sense, and said he already knew the US
                            would be pleased by the actions that would be forthcoming from Ankara.
                            When Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> reiterated
                            that we needed more than just words, <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1"
                                >Caglayangil</persName> tapped the draft paper and said this
                            constituted part of our oral understanding of what Turkey is to do and
                            what the US is to do. It was better to have an understanding in our
                            hearts than on paper, said <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1"
                                >Caglayangil</persName>. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1"
                                >Vance</persName> agreed.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the question of the timing, Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> asked if it would not be better
                            to delay certain actions until after the Greek election in November.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName> at once quickly
                            and firmly agreed. He said that in the meantime both sides could be
                            going about their business—the United States could proceed with the
                                <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> program. Turkey could initiate
                            some of its planning and making certain statements, so that the time
                            between now and November 20 would not be wasted. Thereafter both parties
                            would proceed with appropriate haste to get the job done.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName> stated his strong
                            belief that Turkey and Greece should participate in the intercommunal
                            talks on Cyprus. When it was suggested that it might be difficult to
                            persuade Greece to work along in this way, <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1"
                                >Caglayangil</persName> replied that if the United States took a
                            firm enough position, Greece would come along. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> suggested that might be so.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName> feels that the
                            United States must maintain a very active role with reference to the
                            negotiations on Cyprus and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1"
                                >Vance</persName> suggested that it probably would be most effective
                            if it were done in the background rather than out in front.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">COMMENT:</hi> The tone of the meeting was excellent.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName> spoke with
                            commendable candor. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1"
                                >Vance</persName> was equally frank. There was considerable
                            discussion of the fact that the Cyprus problem was one small and minor
                            element in an entire mosaic. The men agreed <pb n="320" facs="0353"
                                xml:id="pg_320"/>that the future of the bilateral relationship
                            between the United States and Turkey was of great importance and the
                            continued maintenance and strengthening of the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss> Alliance was a matter of prime concern, particularly
                            in the light of recent Soviet arms build ups. Finally, the importance of
                            the discussion centered on the fact that the Secretary and Foreign
                            Minister reached a new approach on how to handle our common problems in
                            the Eastern Mediterranean.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName> was obviously
                            pleased at the result of the talks. At one time he indicated that he was
                            placing his faith, his reputation and his honor on the line, and that we
                            would find that he would carry through on the understandings that were
                            in the process of being reached. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1"
                                >Vance</persName> stated that he knew that President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> favored the <gloss
                                target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> and that he would wish to go ahead
                            with it if his advisers believed that the Congress would pass it. In
                            this regard it was suggested to <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1"
                                >Caglayangil</persName> that the timing of the <gloss
                                target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> might have to change. The President
                            now had pending the Middle East, the Panama Canal and a number of other
                            exceedingly important and controversial issues. These factors might
                            affect the timing of proceeding with the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1"
                                >DCA</gloss>, if the President so decided. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName> said he understood
                            this.</p>

                                facs="0354" xml:id="pg_321"/>would like briefly to review the
                            specific issues we discussed with the Turks, and to set out for you the
                            policy which we recommend for the months ahead with respect to both
                            Turkey and Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>The Turkish Foreign Minister convinced me in New York that his government
                            wants to re-establish the closest possible bilateral defense
                            relationship with the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> He said
                            Turkey was prepared to do whatever was necessary to resolve the Cyprus
                            question and accepted that this was a necessary step to putting
                                Turkish-<gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> relations back on the
                            right track. Turkey could not act, however, so long as it was seen to be
                            responding to direct <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> pressure. A
                            series of positive steps could be initiated, some time after the Greek
                            elections of November 20, to bring about real progress—not just the
                            appearance of progress—with respect to Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said he would discuss this matter further with Prime
                            Minister Demirel upon his return to Ankara; I, in turn, undertook to
                            discuss with you the steps we might consider taking to show our support
                            for these Turkish steps and our readiness to begin moving the <gloss

                        <p>On the basis of our conversations in New York, the Turkish side is now

                            by the Turks in northern Cyprus that could jeopardize matters to be
                            discussed in the Cyprus negotiations.</p>
                        <p>(8) <hi rend="italic">A few practical, interim measures in northern
                                Cyprus</hi> that will demonstrate Turkish flexibility and give
                            evidence that the Turkish side is prepared to alter the existing status
                            quo.</p>
                        <p>These steps will not in themselves solve the Cyprus issue or necessarily
                            even result in sustained negotiations. Indeed, unless Turkish proposals
                            are met by responsiveness on the part of the Greeks and Greek Cypriots,
                            they may lead nowhere. Yet I believe it would be unrealistic to expect
                            the Turks to pledge to do more initially than we were able to exact from
                            the Turkish Foreign Minister as outlined above. I also think that if the
                            Turkish government really takes these steps, and they in turn are
                            supported by the Western Europeans and ourselves, a positive atmosphere
                            will be created and a solid basis laid for the kind of serious
                            negotiating progress which has been absent for the past three years.</p>
                        <p>I believe we should tell the Turks we will endorse the steps outlined
                            above, and will work with them, to the extent our behind-the-scenes
                            involvement will be helpful and accepted, in ensuring the most
                            productive results possible.</p>
                        <p>As this process moves forward, the Turks will expect the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> to do the following:</p>
                        <p>(1) Arrange for early Presidential Determinations to cover the $175
                            million already authorized by Congress for <gloss target="#t_FMS_1"
                                >FMS</gloss> credits for Turkey in <gloss target="#t_FY_1"

                        <p>(2) Use our influence with <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Secretary

                            and Greek Cypriot governments to broaden the Cyprus negotiating
                            mechanism so that Greece and Turkey as well as the two Cypriot
                            communities can participate in meaningful negotiations.</p>
                        <p>(3) Undertake to schedule Congressional hearings on the Turkish <gloss

                            Congressional approval by March/April 1978. (We should also seek to
                            persuade the Greeks to sign their <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>,
                            which has been initialled, in December so that it can be considered at

                        <p>I know it will be difficult, given our other foreign and domestic policy
                            concerns at present, to commit ourselves to still another legisla<pb
                                n="323" facs="0356" xml:id="pg_323"/>tive program in the foreign
                            policy field. Nonetheless, I believe it is a matter which cannot be put
                            to one side much longer. The Turks have felt themselves disadvantaged
                            and humiliated by the Congressionally-imposed “embargo” which has been
                            in effect for more than two years. They view enactment of the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Turkish Defense Cooperation Agreement,
                            which was signed in March 1976, as the vehicle to restore our bilateral
                            and <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> relationship. Our choice,
                            therefore, is to test them now or to accept a continuing stalemate, or
                            worse, in the eastern Mediterranean. <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clark
                                Clifford</persName> and I believe working with the Turks in the
                            manner discussed in New York gives us the best chance to make progress
                            on Cyprus—and the opportunity to restore the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss>-Turkish security relationship, resume our operations
                            at Turkish intelligence facilities and strengthen Turkey’s <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> capability. If we do not move ahead
                            in this manner, I can foresee only continued stalemate in the Cyprus
                            negotiations and a deteriorating security relationship with Turkey, with
                            serious consequences for <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> and the
                            entire region.</p>
                        <p>I believe that the time has come to test the Turks and take the risk
                            involved. The scenario outlined above provides sufficient safeguards so
                            that we need not proceed too far or too fast without testing the
                            consequences. We will in effect be doing nothing visible until the Turks
                            begin to act. Public actions would begin in earnest only after the
                            November 20 Greek elections while our moves in the Congress in respect
                            to the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> need not begin until late
                            January, by which time we will be in a position to gauge the sincerity
                            of Turkish actions. Thus, we are proposing that (a) we take certain
                            minimal interim steps at an early date and (b) inform the Turks that we
                            will pursue common goals, including pushing the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1"

                        <p>In mid-October 1977, the <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>
                            administration set in motion the legislative and political work required
                            to reestablish <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> arms sales to
                            Turkey. At immediate issue was the financing of $93.7 million for 40
                            F–4E aircraft, ordered by Turkey in August 1976, which would come out of
                            the overall figure of $175 million already slated for defense assistance
                            to Turkey. In an October 24 memorandum to Secretary of State <persName

                            responsibilities so that the articles may be sold to Turkey during

                        <p>1. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Brown</persName> opened the meeting by
                            congratulating Minister <persName corresp="#p_KT_1">Kapanli</persName>
                            upon his recent appointment as Minister of Defense, saying that he was
                            looking forward to working closely with him. He said that we in the
                            United States place great importance on our relationship with Turkey and
                            that the personal relationship between himself and Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_KT_1">Kapanli</persName> was most important because of
                            strains that had developed between our countries over the past few
                            years. We in the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Government and
                            particularly in the Defense Department value very highly our close
                            bilateral arrangement and hope that in the coming year we can come even
                            closer together, and that he would do all that he could to bring this
                            about. He continued that he had spoken personally with President
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> who shares these
                            strong feelings about <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> as a whole
                            and about the importance of Turkey to the Alliance—that President
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> and Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH_1">Brown</persName> want to see the relationship
                            between our countries strengthened.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Brown</persName> continued that the
                            United States knows that it must take certain steps and that Turkey must
                            also do so to bring this strengthening of relationships about—that
                            rebuilding it is a two-way street. The problem on Cyprus has disturbed
                            this relationship in recent years. Discussions between Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> and the Turkish
                            Foreign Minister will be taking place and Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH_1">Brown</persName> believes that this is a basis <pb
                                n="326" facs="0359" xml:id="pg_326"/>for moving ahead and rebuilding
                            our relationships in the months to come.<note n="2" xml:id="d103fn2">See
                                    <ref target="#d104">Document 104</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Brown</persName> assured Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_KT_1">Kapanli</persName> that within the
                            restraints imposed by our Congress on the Executive Branch of the United
                            States, he wants to do all that he can to improve our relationships with
                            Turkey and to improve the Turkish defense capability. As soon as the
                            Foreign Ministers’ discussions have moved ahead in the next few months,
                            he will be doing all he can to push the Defense Cooperation Agreement
                            through Congress. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Brown</persName>
                            stated that he had visited Turkey several times, that he had enormous
                            respect for the fighting qualities of the Turkish military, and for the
                            dedication of Turkey to the Alliance, and thus had very strong feelings
                            and reasons for restoring our traditional relationship.</p>
                        <p>2. Minister <persName corresp="#p_KT_1">Kapanli</persName> thanked Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Brown</persName> and said that he had
                            listened with great attention to his interesting and valuable ideas,
                            that he especially liked and supported and aligned himself with Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Brown</persName>’s statements about the
                            Alliance with Turkey and about the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss> Alliance to which we each belonged. He said that
                            although he felt that there was no substantive reason for strains in our
                            relationship, we can’t deny that they exist, but that Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH_1">Brown</persName>’s words about Turkey’s position
                            in the Alliance meant much to him and that he especially felt that the
                            statement of what Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Brown</persName> was
                            prepared to do in 1978 was most important.</p>
                        <p>He continued that for all these reasons he would only be too sorry to see
                            any lessening or loss of confidence by the Turkish people in <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>—that we have a long history of
                            Turkish partnership and sharing of Alliance principles. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KT_1">Kapanli</persName> said he was especially
                            heartened by Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Brown</persName>’s mention
                            of having been to Turkey and his impression of the Turkish fighting men
                            of which the Turks are so very proud. Speaking of initiatives to serve
                            to ease strains in our relationships, <persName corresp="#p_KT_1"
                                >Kapanli</persName> said he was not prepared to submit that the
                            faults can be directed toward the Turkish government for the state of
                            affairs, but said that the talks between our Foreign Ministers certainly
                            had a potential for improving the relationships. He agreed to the need
                            for defense cooperation and welcomed Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Brown</persName>’s emphasis on this and was pleased that the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> government recognized the importance
                            of the Defense Cooperation Agreement to our relationship.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KT_1">Kapanli</persName> continued that he was
                            grateful for Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Brown</persName>’s words
                            about his efforts to do everything he could within the constraints
                            imposed by the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Congress and said
                            that he wanted to support and align himself with the statements made
                            about the Belgian government <pb n="327" facs="0360" xml:id="pg_327"
                            />(sic) in the Plenary Session the day before and the need for a strong
                            commitment to the Alliance.<note n="3" xml:id="d103fn3">Reference is
                                presumably to statements made during the <gloss target="#t_DPC_1"
                                    >DPC</gloss> meeting generally about the ongoing importance of
                                maintaining strong relations and cooperation among <gloss
                                    target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> members for defense against the
                                Warsaw Pact, and specifically an acknowledgement that Turkey (and
                                Portugal) urgently needed external assistance for the modernization
                                and support of its forces. These statements were reiterated as
                                Paragraphs 2 and 9, respectively, in the final communiqué issued at
                                the conclusion of the meeting.</note> He emphasized that each and
                            every member of <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> is duty bound to
                            commit itself. He said he was speaking to Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH_1">Brown</persName> in a similar spirit and attitude.
                            He remarked that Turkey, in spite of dedicating 17% of its budget to
                            defense last year, is increasing this percentage to 20% this year, a
                            fact which proves Turkey’s dedication to the Alliance.</p>
                        <p>Finally, <persName corresp="#p_KT_1">Kapanli</persName> stated that the
                            ideas he had presented to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Brown</persName> had the support of Turkey’s public opinion and are
                            not just his views.</p>
                        <p>3. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Brown</persName>, in closing the
                            meeting, stated that he was certainly not attributing any blame to the
                            Turkish government or to the United States government for the strains
                            that had developed between the two countries over the past few years. He
                            said that the question is what to do now and that this was a problem for
                            our Foreign Ministers, that he is confident that they will take steps to
                            resolve this. He concluded by saying that it was a task for himself and
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_KT_1">Kapanli</persName> to do all they
                            could to advance the relationships in the terms that they could handle
                            at their level.</p>
                        <p>4. Both Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Brown</persName> and Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_KT_1">Kapanli</persName> thanked each other
                            warmly for the opportunity to meet, and the meeting adjourned.</p>

                        <p>SUMMARY: The Secretary met with Turkish Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName> for 30 minutes to discuss
                            Cyprus and the US-Turkey defense relationship. The meeting was shorter
                            than had been anticipated because the Secretary’s preceding bilateral
                            meeting with Greek Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_PPA_1"
                                >Papaligouras</persName> started late and ran longer than had been
                            expected. END SUMMARY.</p>
                        <p>While the Turkish press and photographers were leaving the room, the
                            Secretary told <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName> that
                            he hoped to be able to come to Ankara as soon as it was possible to set
                            a date. He and <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName> also
                            briefly discussed the December 11 Turkish local elections.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName> said
                            that since he last met with the Secretary in New York in early October
                            Turkey had made certain efforts with respect to the Cyprus problem.<note
                                n="2" xml:id="d104fn2">See <ref target="#d100">Documents 100</ref>
                                and <ref target="#d101">101</ref>.</note> He had on suitable
                            occasions responded to press queries suggesting that it was difficult to
                            leave the Cyprus problem to the two communities and that it might be
                            useful to consider some way to engage Turkey and Greece in the
                            negotiating <pb n="329" facs="0362" xml:id="pg_329"/>process. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName> said that he thought his
                            remarks might help pave the way for quadripartite talks by starting
                            discussion of that idea.</p>
                        <p>He had also made other constructive statements, including the promise to
                            withdraw Turkish military forces from Cyprus in the context of an agreed
                            settlement. Prime Minister Demirel had made similar statements.<note
                                n="3" xml:id="d104fn3">For example, during a press conference on
                                October 19, Demirel was asked by a Swedish journalist how long
                                Turkey planned on keeping its military in Cyprus. Demirel responded,
                                “Until a new order is established. That is, until a political
                                solution is reached and the people there are no longer threatened.”
                                Demirel went on to say that he had already withdrawn a portion of
                                the soldiers stationed in Cyprus. (Telegram 7750 from Ankara,

                        <p>In order to assist the efforts of <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clark
                                Clifford</persName>, State Department officers had been informed of
                            Turkish thinking on a future constitutional arrangement for Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>It had been decided to withdraw 2,634 more Turkish troops from Cyprus in
                            five steps beginning in the second half of December and continuing every
                            two to three weeks thereafter. <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1"
                                >Caglayangil</persName> said that the withdrawal schedule could be
                            extended or shortened as seemed useful.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName> noted that <persName
                                corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> had stated that hotels in
                            Varosha could be reopened so that foreign tourists could return. The
                            Secretary said he had been pleased to note that statement. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName> said that an expert
                            committee would shortly do research in Varosha to look into which hotels
                            could be opened and how <persName corresp="#p_DR_1"
                            >Denktash</persName>’s statement could be implemented.</p>
                        <p>In summary, <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName> said that
                            he felt the Turkish performance warranted “promotion with two stars to
                            the next class.” However, he suspected that if grades were being
                            awarded, the United States might not get as good a grade. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName> said that there had been
                            certain expectations from the United States which had not yet been met.
                            In particular, the Turkish side needed to know when Congressional
                            hearings would start on the Defense Cooperation Agreement (<gloss
                                target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>). <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1"
                                >Caglayangil</persName> also recalled that the Secretary had
                            promised US support in helping Turkey with its economic difficulties in
                            the international financial institutions. <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1"
                                >Caglayangil</persName> said that thus far such US efforts had not
                            been effective with the <gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss> or other
                            financial institutions. He said that he wanted to bring these matters to
                            the Secretary’s attention quietly and calmly and not in the negative way
                            that the Greek side usually approaches such questions. He also mentioned
                            that the Greeks had asked to participate in <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss>’s Long Term Defense Program but tried to <pb n="330"

                            with “feasibility studies” as well as the idea of inviting <persName

                                xml:id="d104fn5">Reference is presumably to two articles in <hi

                                December 7, 1977, p. 3. Cohen quoted <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1"
                                    >Çağlayangil</persName> based on statements the Foreign Minister
                                made to the Turkish press. The latter article in particular
                                presented agreements between the United States and Turkey as close
                                to final and based on an explicit and mutual understanding that
                                Turkey would “unfreeze” the Cyprus dispute and subsequently the
                                United States would complete legislation to resume its Defense
                                Cooperation Agreement with Turkey.</note> He therefore thought it
                            would be helpful to issue a joint statement after the meeting with the
                            Secretary.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he had talked to the President before leaving for
                            Brussels and that the President had expressed particular interest in
                            learning of the Turkish plans and schedule for further troop
                            withdrawals. The Secretary said he would report to the President on his
                            return to Washington on December 15 on the information which <persName
                                corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName> had outlined. With regard
                            to international financial institutions, the Secretary said he had asked
                            that we do all we could to be helpful to Turkey with the <gloss

                            said he could not give a date for hearings until after he had discussed
                            the matter with the President. The Secretary said he appreciated the
                            statements which <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName> had
                            made and noted that he had referred with interest and appreciation to
                            these statements as constructive steps by Turkey when he spoke to the

                            discussed general US-Greek relations. He had raised the matter of
                            possible four-power Cyprus talks and said he thought this might be a
                            constructive idea. <persName corresp="#p_PPA_1">Papaligouras</persName>
                            had made clear that the current Greek position is negative. In general,
                                <persName corresp="#p_PPA_1">Papaligouras</persName> had been very
                            emotional on this and other issues.</p>
                        <p>Secretary General <persName corresp="#p_ES_1">Elekdag</persName>
                            emphasized again the importance to the Turks of learning when hearings
                            would take place. The Secretary reiterated that he would have to talk to
                            the President. He said there had already been some consultations on the
                            Hill and that we were not sitting on our hands. We must decide how to
                            handle this in our own way and move when we were sure that the proper
                            foundation had been laid. <persName corresp="#p_ES_1">Elekdag</persName>
                            responded that the Foreign Minister had understood in New York that
                            hearings would be arranged in late December or early January. The
                            Secretary said he did not recall any such specific timetable having been
                            discussed and noted that there had been no record kept of their meeting.
                            He did recall that <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName>
                            felt that nothing should be done until after the November 20 Greek
                            elections. He also noted that nothing could realistically be done with
                            Congress in December. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_EM_1"
                                >Esenbel</persName> thought that it was not very likely that
                            anything could be arranged until after Congress returns January 19.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said it was important not to be concerned with specific
                            dates but rather to move on a pace that was appropriate in order to
                            succeed. We had started the necessary steps toward that goal.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName> suggested that under
                            these circumstances, it was important that Turkish troop withdrawals
                            from Cyprus should not be wasted and wondered if it was better to delay
                            until a more propitious time. The Secretary responded that it would
                            indeed be constructive to go forward with the withdrawals and thought
                            this would be seen by Congress as a useful step.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName> said that since
                            Turkey did not have unlimited numbers of soldiers to pull out from
                            Cyprus, he did not want the reduction to be already forgotten at such
                            time as the hearings were held. The Secretary asked if he was free to
                            tell Congress about the Turkish withdrawal action. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName> thought that it would be
                            helpful to do that. The Secretary hoped that when the Turks announced
                            the first reductions they would also make clear that more would follow
                            at a later date. <persName corresp="#p_ES_1">Elekdag</persName> said
                            they would be spread over time to get the maximum <pb n="332"
                                facs="0365" xml:id="pg_332"/>impact in conjunction with the
                            hearings. <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName> said in
                            announcing the first withdrawal a general statement would also refer to
                            the broader context and imply further reductions will be
                            forthcoming.</p>

                            global problem of East-West relations. He needed to know what had
                            happened in this area since the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> was
                            signed. He did not feel well-informed about the basic approach of the
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> Administration and
                            felt that Turkey, as a participant in the alliance, must have broader
                            information on the US perspective. Accordingly, he would welcome a short
                            visit from an authoritative member of the Administration. It should not,
                            however, be anyone below the level of the Secretary of State, Defense or
                                <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>. He felt that a

                            easier to handle since he had invited him to Ankara after the Bilderberg

                        <p>The Joint Chiefs of Staff and I are persuaded that Congressional approval
                            of the proposed Defense Cooperation Agreement with Turkey is becoming
                            more and more important. The military situation on the Southern Flank of
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> is one which offers little
                            comfort. In the case of Turkey, however, the matter is one which we have
                            some power to affect positively or negatively through our handling of
                            the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>. We are running a substantial
                            risk that the longer the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> is delayed
                            the more likely become Turkish actions which as a practical matter will
                            nullify their participation in the Alliance.</p>
                        <p>You may recall that last August I showed to you the attached letter from
                            the Chairman of the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> Military
                            Committee which rather poignantly describes the situation in the Turkish
                            Armed Forces.<note n="2" xml:id="d106fn2">Not attached, but a copy is in

                                The letter, dated July 25, 1977, is from General H.F. Zeiner
                                Gundersen to General <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">George S.

                                >JCS</gloss>. Gundersen wrote that on a recent review of the Turkish
                                military situation, he marveled at the discipline and fitness of the
                                troops, given the “antiquity” of their equipment, much of which
                                dated to the 1940s. Gundersen reported on the frustration felt by
                                Turkish military leaders due to the disparity between their defense
                                burden as a Cold War front-line army and the poor status of their
                                equipment. The swift passage of the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1"
                                    >DCA</gloss>, he believed, “will end what is seen by [the Turks]
                                as the discrimination of one member against another who is doing the

                            meeting in Brussels in early December, several speakers, most
                            prominently the German Minister of Defense, cited this situation as one
                            of serious concern to the Alliance. They are pained by the way we are
                            treating an ally. They are irked because we appear to be acting at the
                            bidding of Greece.</p>
                        <p>As to the Greeks, it is plain to me that they are holding off signing
                            their <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> for the purpose of preventing

                            Uncleared Report of Secretary’s Visit to Ankara.</p>
                        <p>1. Introduction: During the nineteen-hour visit to Ankara January 20–21,
                            the Secretary had two working meetings with Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> which lasted a total of four
                            hours. As foreshadowed in <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                            >Ecevit</persName>’s original invitation, these meetings dealt with a
                            wide range of bilateral and global issues. The central issue discussed
                            however, and the one to which <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                >Ecevit</persName> returned time after time, was the status of the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Turkish bilateral relationship.
                                <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> repeatedly affirmed a
                            desire and <pb n="335" facs="0368" xml:id="pg_335"/>an intention to
                            revitalize what he called the stagnant bilateral relationship, but his
                            comments revealed that he has not fully made up his mind about how he
                            wants to accomplish that task. The following summarizes conversations
                            between the Secretary and Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                >Ecevit</persName> January 20–21.</p>
                        <p>2. The first working session took place after dinner January 20 and
                            lasted two hours. <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> began
                            this session by explaining that his government places great value on the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Turkish relationship, and for
                            that reason his party while in opposition had avoided making the
                            question of the stagnant <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Turkish
                            relationship an emotional issue. He said it appeared that on the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> side the basic reason for the
                            deteriorated state of the relationship had to do with internal political
                            factors. He said that Turkey was forced to accept this as a fact of life
                            but it was sometimes difficult to deal with and Turks sometimes wondered
                            if there were not some other deeper reason for the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> attitude.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> said that the stagnation
                            in relations between the two countries had done great damage to Turkish
                            security and that Turkey could not continue to allow its security to
                            deteriote. He volunteered that he was not talking about a threat from
                            the Soviet Union. He said he was not aware of any particular increase in
                            pressures from the Soviet Union, and although Turkey is always aware of
                            the Soviet reality, it was not the current cause for concern. The
                            present problem has to do with the rapid increase in armaments in the
                            countries neighboring Turkey on the west, east and south. <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> said that since the United
                            States is the source of many of these arms, Turkey wonders if there
                            might be some hidden reason.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> said he had concluded
                            that the time had come for a reevaluation of the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss>-Turkish relationship. To help him in this he would
                            appreciate being brought up to date on developments in <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Soviet relations which might affect
                            Turkey. He specifically asked whether it was true as had been widely
                            rumored that the United States and the Soviet Union had come to a
                            gentlemen’s agreement three or four years ago to divide the world into
                            spheres of influence with the Middle East being left to the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> then said he believed
                            the “phenomenal development” of Turkish democracy had been given undue
                            weight by Turkey’s friends in their dealings with Ankara. He said that
                            Turkey is the only developing country that has been successful in
                            maintaining democracy uninterrupted since World War II. <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> said he thought this achievement
                            should be considered by Turkey’s Western allies to be more important
                            than the bravery of Turkish soldiers. If this factor doesn’t carry any
                            weight with the <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>
                            administration, he said, he feared that it would never carry any
                            weight.</p>
                        <pb n="336" facs="0369" xml:id="pg_336"/>
                        <p>6. In response to <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>’s opening
                            remarks, the Secretary said the United States had taken note of the lack
                            of emotionalism in Turkey about the state of the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss>-Turkish relationship and appreciated it. The Secretary
                            said he agreed with the Prime Minister’s view that domestic political
                            factors in the United States played a significant role in the strain in
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Turkish relations. He said that
                            when the <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> administration
                            had taken office, it had very carefully evaluated the possibility of
                            getting a Turkish-<gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Defense
                            Cooperation Agreement through Congress. As a result of this evaluation,
                            the <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> administration had
                            determined that the votes simply were not there. The Secretary said he
                            thought this situation was changing however. He expected that the <gloss
                                target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> would come up for discussion in the
                            Congress in March of this year and he was hopeful that it would be
                            passed.</p>
                        <p>7. The Secretary then responded to <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                >Ecevit</persName>’s question about the status of <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Soviet relations with a brief summary
                            of the areas of cooperation and competition between the two countries.
                            He also specifically denied the existance of a gentlemen’s agreement
                            between the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> as described by <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>. He reviewed recent developments
                            in the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> talks and expressed his
                            personal judgment that a new agreement would be possible by April of
                            this year. The Secretary said he also believed that substantial progress
                            had been made toward a comprehensive test ban and that work was
                            proceeding satisfactorily on the question of armaments limitation in the
                            Indian Ocean and on a chemical warfare agreement.</p>
                        <p>8. The Secretary said that during the past year the most important area
                            of contention between the United States and the Soviet Union has been in
                            the field of human rights. Two other areas of dispute in US-Soviet
                            relations were the Soviet role in the Horn of Africa and the
                            unsatisfactory bilateral trade relationship which had resulted from
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> legislative restrictions.</p>
                        <p>9. The Secretary then responded to <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                >Ecevit</persName>’s complaint that Turkey’s success in democracy
                            had been given inadequate recognition by its allies, particularly the
                            United States. He acknowledged that democracy is particularly important
                            to the <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> administration and
                            said that Turkey’s successes had perhaps not been taken into account
                            sufficiently. He promised to review that question.</p>
                        <p>10. The Secretary then asked the Prime Minister what he considered to be
                            the most important problems in the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss>-Turkish bilateral relationship and what major problems
                            Turkey faced in its relations with neighboring countries.</p>
                        <p>11. Referring to the Secretary’s comments about progress toward a new
                                <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> agreement, <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> asked if the development of the
                            neutron bomb would affect that progress. The Secretary said it would
                            not. What it might affect, he said, would be the deployment of forces in
                            Central <pb n="337" facs="0370" xml:id="pg_337"/>Europe since the
                            neutron bomb would be a particularly effective weapon against armor
                            formations. The Secretary went on to say that if our allies do not
                            believe that deployment of such a weapon on their territory is a good
                            idea, then the United States is clearly not interested in deploying it.
                            The United States had still not received a clear answer, however, about
                            the attitudes of its allies.</p>
                        <p>12. In response to the Secretary’s question about trouble spots in the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Turkish bilateral relationship,
                                <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> said the first problem
                            is the role the United States plays—perhaps in spite of itself—in the
                            deterioration of Turkish-Greek relations. He explained that as long as
                            Greece believes it has the unqualified support of the United States, it
                            will not be willing to negotiate seriously with Turkey. He said that
                            when the two countries had been left alone to solve their problems, they
                            had been quite successful in doing so.</p>
                        <p>13. A second problem in the bilateral relationship <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> identified as military
                            cooperation. He said his government wanted to dissociate the embargo
                            from the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>. He said the embargo was a
                            clearly negative factor which should be removed first. Then, he said,
                            the United States could proceed to the “positive possibility” of the
                                <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>. Ecvit said the <gloss
                                target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> should be reviewed in the light of
                            developments since it was signed in March 1976—increased arms sales to
                            Turkey’s neighbors, depreciation of the dollar and increases in cost of
                            arms. He also said that the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> as it
                            stands calls for an immeasurably larger contribution from Turkey than
                            from the United States.</p>
                        <p>14. <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> said that in contrast
                            with the previous government, his government intended to accord priority
                            to the development of Turkey’s economy. That economy, he said, was in
                            particularly bad shape as a result of the United States arms embargo,
                            the need for oil imports, and the mistakes of the previous government.
                            The <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>, as it is now written,
                            increases those burdens without providing any “compensating vitalism”,
                            he said. <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> acknowledged that
                            it would be a difficult task to rewrite the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1"
                                >DCA</gloss> but he thought perhaps it could be supplemented by
                            elements of economic cooperation. He suggested that such cooperation
                            could be in the fields of arms industries or in other fields. Regardless
                            the purpose would be to compensate for the burdens imposed on the
                            Turkish economy by the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>15. Referring to the Secretary’s comments on US-Soviet relations,
                                <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> said he was pleased
                            that the Secretary had indicated relations between the two countries
                            were improving. Particularly under these circumstances, <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> said, Turkey did not want to
                            take actions which might be considered provocative by its neighbors. He
                            said that in conversations with Soviet leaders he had found them to be
                            particularly concerned about the American “observation installations” in
                            Turkey. <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> said he had gained
                            the impression that the reactivation of those <pb n="338" facs="0371"
                                xml:id="pg_338"/>installations would be considered provocative. He
                            said he himself did not consider them provocative and he recognized that
                            Turkey had a responsibility to the Alliance and to the world with
                            respect to the installations. However, he wanted to lighten Turkey’s
                            burden in this regard. He wondered, he said, if the United States would
                            consider trying to incorporate these installations into a <gloss
                                target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> agreement with the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>16. The Secretary said that national technical verification capability
                            had been an important element in the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                                >SALT</gloss> talks. Since the intelligence installations in Turkey
                            were of a similar nature, he said he would be glad to explore the Prime
                            Minister’s proposal as a technical question. He said he didn’t know
                            whether it would work or not but he would look into it. He said he did
                            not think anything could be done in this regard until <gloss
                                target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> III.</p>
                        <p>17. <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> again said that Turkey
                            did not want to shirk its responsibility to the Alliance. On the other
                            hand, he felt that Turkish security had been unduly endangered by its
                            participation in the Alliance. He said that in his view, Turkey had been
                            used as a tool by the allies, forcing the Soviet Union to concentrate
                            forces in the Caucasus and thereby reducing the burden on Western
                            Europe. He again said that he thought it was time for Allied attitudes
                            toward Turkey to undergo a transformation. He said that Turkey should be
                            evaluated not for her military contribution but for her political
                            development, i.e. her success in democracy. He said he wanted Turkey to
                            be considered something more than a collection of brave soldiers.</p>
                        <p>18. Responding to <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>’s
                            expressed wish that the United States dissociate Greek-Turkish relations
                            from US-Turkish relations, the Secretary said that in so far as the
                            Cyprus problem is concerned, the United States has no desire to be
                            involved. He said that if Turkey, Greece, and Cyprus can solve the
                            problem by themselves, the United States would be delighted.</p>
                        <p>19. The Secretary said that the Prime Minister’s suggestion that the
                                <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> might be expanded to include
                            economic cooperation raised a number of complex and difficult issues
                            which he needed to reflect on before giving him an answer. At the same
                            time, the Secretary said there was one potential problem with the <gloss
                                target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> that he wanted to point out. He said
                            there are some people in Congress who have a fundamental difficulty with
                            the concept of four-year agreements. He said he didn’t think this
                            opposition was insurmountable, but he simply wanted to advise the Prime
                            Minister that it does exist.</p>
                        <p>20. <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> then reviewed Turkey’s
                            bilateral relationships with its neighbors. Turning first to Iran, he
                            said Turkey had no problems in its relationship with Iran, but there
                            were no cooperative developments either, despite what Turkey sees as
                            extensive opportunity. The Secretary <pb n="339" facs="0372"
                                xml:id="pg_339"/>said he had discussed this problem with the
                            Iranians and he suggested that the Prime Minister again raise with Iran
                            the possibility of increased cooperation.</p>
                        <p>21. <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> said Turkey had
                            increasingly good relations with the Arab states, particularly Iraq and
                            Libya. He said he recognized that the United States did not have good
                            relations with those two countries, and he suggested that those
                            relationships be re-evaluated because he believed these two
                            countries—more than any other oil-producing countries—try to use their
                            money for the good of their people. The Secretary noted that recent US
                            efforts to improve relations with Iraq had been rebuffed.</p>
                        <p>22. <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> then turned to
                            Greek-Turkish relations. He said the Aegean issue is an increasingly
                            important problem in the relationship between the two countries. Turkey
                            could not forego its rights in the Aegean, he asserted. With respect to
                            Greek claims that Turkey harbors expansionist aims, <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> said he would be willing to give
                            any kind of guarantee that Turkey has no designs on the Greek islands of
                            the Aegean.</p>
                        <p>23. <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> said he is willing to
                            enter a high-level political dialogue with Greece soon as possible, but
                            he noted that the Greeks seemed reluctant. He said he realized summit
                            talks required extensive groundwork, but he thought that it might even
                            be possible to have a top-level talk even to prepare the groundwork for
                            future meetings.</p>
                        <p>24. <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> said he realized that
                            Greek Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName>
                            would have greater political problems than he would with a summit
                            meeting. Nevertheless, he said he believed that <persName
                                corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName> attaches some value to
                            improving Greek-Turkish relations. He noted that <persName
                                corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName> is perhaps at the peak of
                            his career and may not be around much longer. After <persName
                                corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName> goes, <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> said, it might be too late. This
                            opportunity should not be missed.</p>
                        <p>25. <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> then said that the
                            military balance between Greece and Turkey had been upset in recent
                            years. He said that he sincerely believed that Greeks and Turks have no
                            basic conflicts, but he was convinced that the Greeks would not be
                            prepared to enter into a sincere dialogue until the present military
                            imbalance is corrected.</p>
                        <p>26. On the Cyprus question <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>
                            said that his government wanted the Turkish Cypriots to take the
                            initiative on both the territorial and constitutional questions. He
                            cautioned, however, that the Greeks should not expect too much from the
                            Turkish proposals. He said he had been prepared to be generous on
                            territory in 1974, but because of permanent settlements that have taken
                            place in the intervening period, adjustments in the demarcation line
                            would be more difficult. He also said that his government is committed
                            to a Cyprus settlement based on a federal framework. Such a solution, he
                            said, would be the healthiest so<pb n="340" facs="0373" xml:id="pg_340"
                            />lution and would avert the possibility of partition. <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> said that both sides must accept
                            the reality that the two communities must live separately. On the other
                            hand, however, freedom of movement should be possible in time.</p>
                        <p>27. The Secretary thanked the Prime Minister and said he shared his view
                            that a federal framework provides the only chance for a viable solution.
                            He then asked if <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> had been
                            in touch with <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName>.
                                <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> pointed out that
                                <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> is not his
                            counterpart. He said that from what he had read, however, he thought
                            that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> would not be
                            an easy person for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName>
                            to deal with.</p>
                        <p>28. This session concluded with <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                >Ecevit</persName> saying that the Greek Cypriots and Greeks profess
                            to believe that Turkey and Greece should not be involved in the Cyprus
                            negotiations. <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> said, in his
                            view, total uninvolvement is unrealistic. He believed that Turkey and
                            Greece need not be directly involved but they would need to give
                            encouragement to their ethnic counterparts in order for a settlement to
                            be reached.</p>
                        <p>29. When the talks resumed the morning of January 21, the Secretary
                            briefed the Prime Minister on the Middle East situation. The Secretary
                            summarized in some detail the background, framework, and objectives of
                            the Egyptian-Israeli talks. He explained that earlier in the week good
                            progress had been made on some aspects of the talks, but at that point
                                <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> had recalled his
                            delegation. The Secretary said that <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                                >Sadat</persName> had explained to him that the recall of his
                            Foreign Minister did not signify an end to his commitment to the
                                talks.<note n="2" xml:id="d107fn2">See <ref

                            inflammatory statements made by <persName corresp="#p_BM_2"
                                >Begin</persName> earlier in the week, he believed that it was
                            necessary to have a cooling-off period. Otherwise he feared an
                            uncontrolled escalation of counterstatements would have resulted. The
                            Secretary said that <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> had
                            explained that he viewed what had happened as only a temporary setback.
                            The Secretary told <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> that in
                            his judgment the process will slow down for a time but will
                            continue.</p>
                        <p>30. In response to the Secretary’s request for his views, <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> said he believed it would be
                            very risky to tell the Palestinians they could not have a national
                            homeland. He then returned to his view expressed during talks the
                            previous evening concerning the importance of Libya and Iraq. He said he
                            believed a Middle East solution would have to be satisfactory to them in
                            order to be viable.</p>
                        <p>31. The Secretary then returned to the subject of the <gloss
                                target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> and told <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                >Ecevit</persName> that during the night he had given some
                            preliminary thought to the possibility, as suggested by <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>, of amending the <gloss
                                target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>. He said <pb n="341" facs="0374"
                                xml:id="pg_341"/>that he believed an effort to amend the <gloss
                                target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> would create a great many problems.
                                <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> said he had not
                            officially asked for amendment of the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1"
                                >DCA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>32. The Secretary then brought up the subject of missing persons in
                            Cyprus, being reported <gloss target="#t_septel_1">septel</gloss>.<note

                                Greek Cypriots missing since the 1974 conflict (which he numbered at
                                thirty) as a tactic used by the Greek Cypriots to “bog down” the
                                intercommunal talks. (Department of State, Office of the Secretariat

                        </p>
                        <p>33. <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> then reverted to the
                            subject of the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>. He said that the
                            Secretary had mentioned the previous evening the possibility that
                            Congress might wish to reduce the term of the agreement to less than
                            four years. The result of such an effort, he said, would be public
                            indignation in Turkey and damage to his government. To avoid this
                            possibility he suggested that both governments should look into ways to
                            cooperate, perhaps in amending the agreement. One possibility, he
                            suggested, might be to take the initiative to shorten the agreed term of
                            the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> while keeping the financial
                            commitments at the same level. After all, he pointed out, nearly half of
                            its four year term has already passed, during which time prices have
                            gone up and the dollar has lost value. He acknowledged, however, that he
                            recognized the riskiness of an amendment effort. The Secretary strongly
                            agreed that amending the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> would be a
                            very risky business.</p>
                        <p>34. The Secretary then clarified that he had mentioned the subject of
                            congressional opposition to a four year term agreement only because
                            there are one or two Senators who might bring it up as a matter of
                            principle. He did not think they would carry the day, however.</p>
                        <p>35. The Prime Minister warned that an “unsavory” discussion in Congress
                            would have its counterpart in the Turkish Parliament. It might make the
                                <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> more palatable, he said, to
                            reduce it to two years while maintaining the same financial
                            commitment.</p>
                        <p>36. <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> then shifted the
                            subject to Greek-Turkish relations. He said that the Secretary had
                            stated that the United States did not want to be involved in the
                            disputes concerning Cyprus or the Aegean. <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                >Ecevit</persName> said the fact is that the United States is
                            involved but it only focuses on Cyprus and ignores the Aegean which is
                            extremely important to Turkey. He repeated his statement of previous
                            evening that Turkey could not forego its rights in the Aegean.</p>
                        <p>37. <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> also complained that,
                            although Greece has heavily armed its Aegean islands, the United States
                            has not objected. He also said that Greece is deploying arms it has
                            acquired from the United <pb n="342" facs="0375" xml:id="pg_342"/>States
                            not for collective defense but against Turkey. The Secretary said that
                            he had, in fact, raised the problem of militarization of the Aegean
                            islands with the Greeks at the request of the <gloss target="#t_GOT_1"
                                >GOT</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_MFA_1">MFA</gloss> Secretary General
                                <persName corresp="#p_ES_1">Elekdag</persName> intervened to say
                            that he did not recall that <gloss target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> had
                            ever requested that we do so. The Secretary said that the United States
                            had raised the issue with <persName corresp="#p_CC_1"
                                >Caramanlis</persName> in London.<note n="4" xml:id="d107fn4"

                            explained that they were taking action only in self-defense.
                            Nevertheless, the Secretary said that he had made it clear that he was
                            concerned that he considered the matter serious.</p>

                            and Turkey. He said this imbalance must be remedied if there is to be a
                            dialogue. The Greeks, he suggested, do not want to make a serious effort
                            to resolve the Aegean dispute, preferring to let the talks drag on
                            indefinitely.</p>
                        <p>40. <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> then asked the

                            bilateral problems. The Secretary said the two sides should aim for

                        <p>41. <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> said he would like to
                            know whether the United States would be able to help Turkey deal with
                            its immediate economic problems, both by bilateral assistance and advice
                            and by using its good offices with the International Monetary Fund. The

                            asked if the United States would be willing to consider some kind of

                                >DCA</gloss>. The Secretary asked that the Prime Minister make
                            specific proposals. With respect to the immediate future, however, the
                            aid bill had already been completed.</p>
                        <p>42. Returning to his idea that the embargo and the <gloss

                            Minister asked the Secretary whether he believed the embargo should be
                            lifted first. The Secretary said it was a difficult political question
                            and he would prefer to go through the congressional hearings on the
                                <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> in March. Prime Minister said
                            that lifting the embargo would ease his political problems; however, he
                            was not pressing it.</p>
                        <p>43. <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> then brought up the
                            question of Kurdish separatism. He said Turks have the impression that
                            the United States backs the Kurdish national movement. The Secretary
                            assured him that the United States was not supporting the Kurdish
                            national movement.</p>

                            assistance. The Secretary said that inasmuch as the aid bill had been
                            completed, defense support assistance for Turkey would require
                            supplemental legislation, and he would need to discuss that possibility
                            with the President.</p>

                            then returned to the question of timing for congressional action on the

                                >Elekdag</persName> confirmed that statement, and complained that

                        <p>First reports from that group are mixed. As usual, the Turks hoped our

                            9–10, but fleshed-out Turkish proposals on Cyprus are not yet ready.
                                <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>’s subordinates hinted

                            the other hand, the Turks are all too aware of our Congressional timing:

                        <p>1443. For the Secretary from the Ambassador. Subj: US–<gloss
                                target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> Relations.</p>
                        <p>1. Although I have had a good opportunity to discuss the subject with
                                <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Matt Nimetz</persName> over the past two
                            days, I believe it is my responsibility to convey to you directly my
                            strong recommendation that you and the President decide to move firmly
                            in support of early congressional endorsement of the Turkish <gloss
                                target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> in the hearings during the next
                            month.</p>
                        <p>2. The reasons for and against this have been rehearsed at length, but I
                            want to summarize my own views in the light of the meetings we have had
                            over the past two days.</p>
                        <pb n="346" facs="0379" xml:id="pg_346"/>
                        <p>3. Fundamentally, I believe that our relations with Turkey will be
                            irreversibly damaged if we do not make this move. This country is more
                            important to us than either Greece or Cyprus, although I do not think
                            that we should let it become an either/or choice.</p>
                        <p>4. In his polite, matter-of-fact, way <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                >Ecevit</persName> has given us a time limit. I have no doubt that
                            he means it. If we do not move on the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1"
                                >DCA</gloss> by the time of the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss> summit, Turkey will make a major assessment of its
                            interests and alignments in this world.<note n="2" xml:id="d109fn2">The
                                summit took place in Washington May 30–31.</note> The conventional
                            wisdom is that Turkey has no options. I do not believe that this is the
                            case over the long run. Certainly Turkey does not.</p>
                        <p>5. As a first step, I believe that Turkey will close down the five US
                            facilities which have been in provisional status. Ironically, the
                            significance of these installations may be even greater for their
                            capability to monitor and extend our arms control agreements than for
                            purely military reasons. While all of them, at least theoretically,
                            could be relocated, it would be at substantial cost to the US, probably
                            including some degradation of our intelligence and verification
                            capability.</p>
                        <p>6. I also take seriously the statement that <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                >Ecevit</persName> will not go to the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss> summit meeting in Washington in May if the <gloss
                                target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> is still languishing. Even aside from
                            the impact of the non-attendance of the scheduled presiding officer at
                            the summit, his absence would be a major blow to the Alliance at a
                            session presumably designed to show solidarity and strengthen the
                            Alliance. It is clear to me that most of our allies are uneasy about the
                            embargo and its consequences, and there is a good deal of sympathy for
                            the Turkish position despite the view that the <gloss target="#t_GOT_1"
                                >GOT</gloss> should have been more forthcoming on Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>7. I do not know what, if anything, the Turkish Government would do with
                            respect to its position in <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>.
                            However, I believe that Turkey will set itself on a path that gradually
                            but inexorably will diverge from that of its <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss> partners. One practical factor is that as long as our
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>-related forces remain here
                            under the restrictions and burdens imposed by “provisional status,”
                            which can only be relieved by passage of the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1"
                                >DCA</gloss>, tensions and difficulties will increase in our
                            [garble—military-to]-military relations to a point where we will
                            probably both want our forces and our weapons removed. The consequence
                            will be a progressive severing of Alliance ties when preservation of an
                            acceptable East-West balance is a sine qua non for our efforts to build
                            a stable detente and extend the arms control process.</p>
                        <p>8. Turkey is in deep economic trouble, primarily because of the impact of
                            oil prices and the attempts of previous governments to continue an
                            unsustainably high growth rate. <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                >Ecevit</persName> is like an archaeologist pre<pb n="347"
                                facs="0380" xml:id="pg_347"/>siding over a dig, the dimensions of
                            which are only gradually becoming clear and the precise extent of which
                            is not yet known. I do not think it is an exaggeration to say that the
                            political and social stability and the democratic institutions of this
                            country could, perhaps quite rapidly, be put in jeopardy. To judge from
                            our contacts with Turkish officials in the past few days, the Turkish
                            Government itself is deeply worried about the social consequences of the
                            present economic crisis and of the austerity measures necessary to
                            correct it. Although it is an irrational view, the fact of the embargo
                            leaves us holding some of the bag for this situation in Turkish opinion.
                            More importantly, I am convinced that as long as the embargo exists, we
                            will be hampered in our ability to be helpful in this country’s struggle
                            to maintain the political institutions basic to the freedom of 42
                            million people. Its removal seems to be a first step to anything
                            else.</p>
                        <p>9. Finally, I realize that there are differences of view on whether the
                            embargo gives leverage on Cyprus. I am firmly convinced that it does
                            not, that it has operated for three years as an impediment rather than a
                            stimulus to progress. However, I now believe this issue is academic.
                                <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>, in my judgment, is
                            firmly committed to do everything reasonable toward a Cyprus settlement,
                            embargo or no. Under these circumstances, continuation of the embargo
                            will only do more damage to our relationship and to the Alliance as a
                            whole. It will not push <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>
                            into doing more to settle Cyprus than he would do without it.</p>
                        <p>10. I also accept the point of view that the embargo now operates as a
                            disincentive to the Greeks and Greek Cypriots to negotiate. There is
                            burgeoning evidence that their policies are more influenced by the
                            objective of keeping the embargo in place, with the mistaken idea this
                            is the way for us to force Turkish concessions on their behalf, than to
                            achieving progress on substance. It would be unfortunate if the
                            disincentive of the embargo led them—and us—to miss a settlement
                            opportunity which may not recur for some time.</p>
                        <p>11. I realize that from my perspective I can only see part of the
                            problem, but I feel that I owe it to you and to the President to be as
                            clear as I can in stating this perspective. Those who oppose lifting the
                            embargo now tie their willingness to do so to “a solution” in Cyprus. “A
                            solution”, I fear, is a ways away, even with the maximum good will on
                            all sides. If they will not agree to lifting the embargo until a
                            settlement is signed, sealed and delivered, there is not much likelihood
                            of their being brought around in time to avoid many of the consequences
                            I have alluded to above.</p>
                        <p>12. For all these reasons I urge that we bite this bullet now.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_SPS_1">Sarbanes</persName>, I stressed my
                            negative approach to any immediate economic assistance to Turkey and to
                            making a commitment on the Turkish Defense Cooperation Agreement (<gloss
                                target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>). I also indicated that I had pressed
                            for real progress on Cyprus in order to create the conditions which
                            would make <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> approval possible. I
                            told <persName corresp="#p_BJ_1">Brademas</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_SPS_1">Sarbanes</persName> that the Turkish proposals on
                            Cyprus are not yet finished but from a general description we were led
                            to expect a true federation and a territorial approach involving
                            relocation of a substantial number of Turkish Cypriots; there were signs
                            as well that Varosha would be negotiable. I emphasized that I had
                            stressed in Ankara the importance we attach to forthcoming Turkish
                            proposals. <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> had stressed to
                            me that he wants Cyprus solved and that the proposals will be
                            reasonable.</p>
                        <p>I indicated that the Turks anticipate the Administration will move ahead
                            in Congress with the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> in the coming
                            weeks and that, while they made no threats, they expect to know exactly
                            where they stand before the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                            summit in Washington at the end of May. I said we attach great
                            importance to a Cyprus settlement, but we wanted to maintain and
                            strengthen our relationship with Turkey. I told <persName

                                corresp="#p_SPS_1">Sarbanes</persName> that the risk of a complete

                            could be expected to re-evaluate its defense relationship if the <gloss

                            <persName corresp="#p_BJ_1">Brademas</persName> responded that in his
                            view the Administration had undermined the credibility of a clear and
                            direct linkage between movement to resolve the US-Turkish defense

                            into “who lost Turkey” in the event Turkey cuts or limits its links with

                            personal commitments to them. If the issues are handled properly, we can
                            probably avoid serious damage to this and other legislative

                        <p>On April 4, Congressman <persName corresp="#p_HLH_1">Lee
                                Hamilton</persName> will hold hearings on Greece and Turkey in
                            connection with <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 79 assistance. This

                                corresp="#p_HLH_1">Hamilton</persName> agreed to postpone it to give

                                target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>. Meanwhile, <persName
                                corresp="#p_HLH_1">Hamilton</persName> and a majority of members of
                            the House International Relations Committee have written Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> recommending that the
                                <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> be submitted in adequate time
                            to be considered along with this year’s Security Assistance bill and
                            promising support.</p>
                        <p>The House floor will probably be the most serious hurdle, although Rules
                            may be a problem because <persName corresp="#p_OTP_1">O’Neill</persName>
                            has always supported <persName corresp="#p_BJ_1">Brademas</persName> on
                            this issue. With strong Presidential endorsement, we believe the Turkish

                            Senate, the most serious problem is the impacted calendar.</p>
                        <p>In view of the April 4 deadline, we must have a final decision and full
                            rationale by roughly March 20. With this in hand, the following steps
                            should then be taken:</p>
                        <p>1. At least a week before announcement or leaks, the Secretary of State
                            and possibly the President should talk individually with <persName
                                corresp="#p_SPS_1">Sarbanes</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BJ_1"
                                >Brademas</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_RBS_1"
                                >Rosenthal</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_ETF_1"
                                >Eagleton</persName> to explain the reasons for the Administration
                            decision. We should state frankly that we want to give them time to
                            adjust to what we know to be a difficult development for them. We should
                            appeal for as much understanding as possible and for help in explaining
                            to their Greek-American constituents the factors which compelled the
                            Administration decision. We should invite them to make whatever use of
                            the information they wish during the succeeding week, but make it clear
                            that any leaks will come from them, not us.</p>
                        <p>2. Simultaneously, the decision should be communicated directly to Prime

                            <salute>Dear Mr. Prime Minister:</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>As you know, we have recently conducted a thorough review of our Eastern
                            Mediterranean policy in preparation for this spring’s Congressional
                            hearings relating to the 1979 security assistance program for Turkey and
                            Greece. I thought it important that you receive directly a full
                            description of my decisions as well as an explanation of the factors
                            which are behind these decisions. For this reason, I have dispatched
                                <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Warren Christopher</persName> to meet
                            with you personally. He will speak frankly and with my full
                            confidence.</p>
                        <p>I want to assure you of the vital importance I attach to an early
                            resumption of the closest possible relations between the United States
                            and Turkey. I have the greatest respect for what you are doing to break
                            the impasse in the area which has existed for too long. We have been
                            particularly impressed by your initiative to deal with the difficulties
                            which have existed between your country and Greece, and thus I have been
                            pleased to learn that your meeting with Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName> in Montreux seems to have
                            been a success in opening the way for further dialogue.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d112fn2">The meeting took place March 10–11. See <ref
                                    target="#d175fn7">footnote 7, Document 175</ref>.</note> I am
                            also impressed by the strength of democratic institutions in Turkey
                            despite what we recognize are severe strains. I <pb n="353" facs="0386"
                                xml:id="pg_353"/>am also pleased that your government has
                            successfully reached agreement with the International Monetary Fund, and
                            I share your hope that this step will be followed by renewed
                            international financial confidence in the long-run economic vitality of
                            Turkey.</p>
                        <p>Against this background, I believe the package which we are prepared to
                            present to Congress early next month is a balanced and fair response to
                            the current situation in the Eastern Mediterranean. I especially
                            endeavored to make concrete my Administration’s commitment to
                            strengthening our relations with your nation. I hope you will see it as
                            a major move forward.</p>
                        <p>This approach is not without risk. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1"
                                >Christopher</persName> will outline the difficulties that we know
                            our approach must overcome to be successful. He will be seeking your
                            understanding and support so that our shared goal of rebuilding our
                            relationship can be realized.</p>
                        <p>I want you to know how much I look forward to meeting with you in
                            Washington in May. I have been greatly impressed by what I have been
                            told about you and by the forthright way you are dealing with the
                            challenges facing Turkey.</p>

                                place in the Cabinet Room from 11:15 to 12:15 p.m. (Carter Library,
                                Presidential Materials)</note> This had culminated a two week
                            review. Following the meeting, the President had asked <gloss
                                target="#t_DepSec_1">DepSec</gloss> to come immediately to Ankara
                            and had given him letter for the <gloss target="#t_PriMin_1"
                                >PriMin</gloss>. The goal of the decisions taken was to resume the
                            closest possible relationship between the two countries. In making his
                            decisions, the President had reviewed various options and had taken into
                            account diplomatic, military, and political factors. Particularly in
                            dealing with political factors, it was important to understand that this
                            was no exact science. Reasonable men could differ. There was, however,
                            now a concrete Presidential decision to go ahead with the program which
                            he would describe. This program would go forward promptly and would be
                            presented in congressional hearings on April 6. <gloss
                                target="#t_DepSec_1">DepSec</gloss> stressed that one important
                            background element in review process was need to make sure that any
                            program proposed could succeed in Congress; this point had been
                            reinforced by recent experience with Panama Canal Treaty.</p>
                        <p>4. <gloss target="#t_DepSec_1">DepSec</gloss> said there were four basic
                            elements in the program which the President intended to recommend to
                            Congress:</p>
                        <p>A) The President would recommend to Congress that the embargo be lifted
                            immediately. As <gloss target="#t_PriMin_1">PriMin</gloss> had said in
                            January, it was the negative factor in our relationship which needed to
                            be removed.<note n="3" xml:id="d113fn3">See <ref target="#d107">Document

                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> dollars; would open up transfer
                            of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> equipment from third countries;
                            and would open up a whole range of other possibilities that had been
                            precluded by the embargo.</p>
                        <p>B) President would recommend to Congress 50 million dollars in security
                            supporting assistance (<gloss target="#t_SSA_1">SSA</gloss>) as an
                            economic loan for <gloss target="#t_BOP_1">BOP</gloss> purposes. This
                            was a substantial departure for the President because the aid budget for
                            1978 was already in the Congress and thus the President <pb n="355"
                                facs="0388" xml:id="pg_355"/>would be reopening his earlier request.
                                <gloss target="#t_DepSec_1">DepSec</gloss> noted parenthetically
                            that the President was pleased with the Turkish accord with the <gloss

                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> had tried to be “somewhat helpful.” He
                            said that an <gloss target="#t_SSA_1">SSA</gloss> loan had a symbolic as
                            well as a practical effect. It would demonstrate <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> confidence in the Turkish economy and, in <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>’s words, would represent
                            “compensating vitalism”. It was an important beginning.</p>
                        <p>C) The President will go ahead with 175 million dollars <gloss
                                target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> in <gloss target="#t_FY_1"
                            >FY</gloss>–1979, the same level as in 1978.</p>
                        <p>D) The President believed the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> should
                            be renegotiated to recognize 1978 realities. As <gloss
                                target="#t_PriMin_1">PriMin</gloss> himself had said, it should be
                            reviewed in light of current developments. This should be done
                            promptly.</p>
                        <p>5. Through this approach President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                >Carter</persName> could put his own stamp on <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> military relations with Turkey. The
                            most important reason for renegotiation, however, was our belief that
                            the current <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> would not succeed in
                            the Congress. This was primarily because of the four-year term and the
                            billion dollar commitment. The agreement could be improved and
                            modernized. There was a new mood in Congress and a desire to evaluate
                            matters on a shorter term basis. Events elsewhere in the world, e.g.
                            negotiations with the Philippines, had shown the great difficulty with a
                            long term <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> commitment.<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d113fn4">The administration was also in the process of

                            renegotiation as a negative factor, but he saw it as positive because of
                            the opportunity it would afford the <gloss target="#t_PriMin_1"
                                >PriMin</gloss> and the President to put their own stamp on <gloss

                                target="#t_DepSec_1">DepSec</gloss> said he wished to emphasize that
                            the President was prepared to fight for the program that he had outlined
                            and to accept the political risks in doing so.</p>
                        <p>6. <gloss target="#t_PriMin_1">PriMin</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> asked <gloss

                            to bases. <gloss target="#t_DepSec_1">DepSec</gloss> replied that some
                            installations were no longer significant. Others might be better under
                            joint operation. He could be more specific if necessary but his real
                            point was that three years had passed and conditions had changed. He
                            then asked Ambassador to comment on the installations.</p>
                        <p>7. Ambassador said that there were five significant bases covered under
                            the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>. One was about to be shut down.
                            Two could perhaps be reopened and operated by Turks with American
                            training and equipment. The other two could possibly be jointly
                            operated. All of this could be reflected in new negotiations. <gloss
                                target="#t_DepSec_1">DepSec</gloss> said he was not prepared to
                            conduct renegotiations on current trip. He would welcome Turkish

                        <p>8. <gloss target="#t_DepSec_1">DepSec</gloss> said that he hoped for
                                <gloss target="#t_PriMin_1">PriMin</gloss>’s favorable reaction to
                            President’s decision which administration would present to the Congress.
                            There were risks involved and it should be understood that passage of
                            the program would not be easy. The President though was anxious to
                            overcome problems which existed in <gloss target="#t_US_1"

                                places outside the Alliance area, both directly and through allies,
                                complicate the search for peace and our ability to sustain support

                        </p>
                        <p>I studied the draft declaration proposed for the forthcoming <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> summit meeting carefully, and found
                            the tone rather strong and challenging and I thought that it might
                            provoke many states to harden their positions, thus resulting in a
                            speeding up of the armaments race. Many of us will be speaking in the
                            special sessions for disarmament of the United Nations right before or
                            right after the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> meeting in
                            Washington and I feel that the proposed declaration would sound rather
                            out of tune with the way I personally would be inclined to speak in that
                            important United Nations meeting.</p>
                        <p>In view of the limitations imposed on her possibilities of maintaining
                            her military strength, Turkey cannot afford to be provocative towards
                            her neighbors.</p>
                        <p>We attach great value to detente in principle. Besides, under the
                            circumstances that Turkey presently finds herself in, she has a stake in
                            detente to which she must make her own contribution in her own way and
                            by keeping in view her own possibilities and limitations.</p>
                        <p>My Government cannot therefore, subscribe to a declaration which, in our
                            view, impairs detente although I am sure, this is not your intention
                                either.<note n="3" xml:id="d114fn3">

                            Embargo.</p>
                        <p>1. Summary: As Turks have indicated, congressional defeat of the
                            administration’s effort to lift the arms embargo would cause the
                                <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> government to review
                            all aspects of Turkish foreign policy, including its Cyprus policy.
                            Although that review might not result in a dramatic, immediate change,
                            it would, we believe, result in a hardening of the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> attitude which in turn would greatly
                            diminish the chances of early resumption of intercommunal talks and
                            could eventually lead to a complete breakdown in the negotiation process
                            followed by partition or <gloss target="#t_UDI_1">UDI</gloss>. End
                            summary.</p>
                        <p>2. One of the many questions brought into focus by the close vote in the
                                <gloss target="#t_HIRC_1">HIRC</gloss> May 4 and the <gloss
                                target="#t_SFRC_1">SFRC</gloss> defeat May 11 is what will happen to
                            Turkey’s Cyprus policy if the administration’s effort to lift the
                            embargo fails. Successive Turkish governments have consistently objected
                            to the concept of linkage between the embargo and the developments on
                            Cyprus, but under Demirel the <gloss target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss>
                            maintained “reverse” linkage by saying that it could not be expected to
                            make concessions on Cyprus as long as the embargo remained in force.
                            When <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> came to power in
                            January, he took the initiative to remove this reverse linkage,
                            declaring that Turkey’s national interests dictated a Cyprus solution

                        <p>3. Although <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> has reconfirmed
                            the policy of non-linkage several times in past weeks, it has become
                            increasingly apparent that linkage will in fact continue as long as the
                            Greek side sees only two feasible alternatives: (a) Turkish capitulation
                            on all major issues; or (b) continuation of the embargo which, if not
                            totally satisfactory, at least keeps Turkey in check while Greece
                            increases its air and naval buildup. Since Turkish capitulation is
                            unlikely, the Greek and Greek Cypriot policy of choice is continuation
                            of the embargo. This choice seems premised on the belief that the Turks
                            will ultimately respond positively to the pressure of the embargo—a
                            belief we consider unrealistic and dangerous.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> has already been
                            frustrated by the fact that his unilateral “peace offensive” did not
                            induce more flexibility on the other side. If the embargo is reconfirmed
                            by Congress—an act Turks will see simply as a response to Greek and
                            Greek Cypriot pressures—we expect <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                >Ecevit</persName> will respond by “reviewing” the whole range of
                            Turkey’s foreign policies including its Cyprus policy.<note n="2"

                                surprise him; that his government was resigned to the possibility

                                would not threaten Turkish independence. But the impact on Turkey’s
                                Cyprus policy would be clear: “It is obvious,” <persName
                                    corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> said, “that as long as the

                                Turkey will eventually yield under pressure, there will be no
                                settlement of the Cyprus problem.” (Telegram 8842 from Bonn, May 12;

                            review will take place in a domestic political atmosphere charged with

                            atmosphere. Reasoned consideration of policy options will probably take
                            a back seat to efforts to find a scapegoat and assert national dignity.
                            There is likely to be an open rejection of the views and concerns of

                            one—capitulation—is likely to be discarded out of hand. The others—from
                            standing fast to <gloss target="#t_UDI_1">UDI</gloss>—seem to us to be a

                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>’s initial approach will take
                            something like the following form:</p>
                        <pb n="361" facs="0394" xml:id="pg_361"/>
                        <p>A. A statement that his efforts for a settlement had been predicated on
                            the assumption that the Greek Cypriot side wished to negotiate a fair
                            settlement, an assumption which they had destroyed;</p>
                        <p>B. A reaffirmation of a willingness of the Turkish side to enter into
                            negotiations on the basis of proposals now on the table; and</p>
                        <p>C. A warning that the Turkish Cypriots cannot be expected to remain
                            indefinitely hostage to an illusory Greek Cypriot goodwill.</p>
                        <p>6. All of the implications of such an approach are not yet clear. One
                            that is, however, is that the intercommunal talks will be postponed
                            indefinitely. Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots will ostensibly remain
                            willing to negotiate. But, in fact, disillusioned by the negative
                            response of the Greek side—and of the world in general—to their earlier
                            efforts, they are likely to become increasingly rigid. In such a
                            situation, resumption of the intercommunal talks will become dependent
                            on a major conciliatory effort by the Greek side, which we gather would
                            be an extremely unlikely development.</p>
                        <p>7. With no prospect of resumed intercommunal talks, it is likely to be
                            only a matter of time until Turkey responds to the pressures of the
                            Turkish Cypriots and super-nationalists in Turkey to seek a “new
                            international status” for the Turkish Federated State of Cyprus. This is
                            a step the <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> government
                            would take only with great reluctance because it violates both
                            long-standing <gloss target="#t_RPP_1">RPP</gloss> policy and popular
                            concepts of national security interests. We therefore think it is
                            unlikely that the <gloss target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> will soon agree
                            to a Unilateral Declaration of Independence. But “creeping
                            partition”—that is, stabilization of the current division—would
                            eventually lead to either independence or incorporation into Turkey.</p>
                        <p>8. This analysis is speculative and we cannot be sure how closely its
                            projections will coincide with developments. Nevertheless, we are
                            convinced that the Turkish reaction to a defeat of the effort to repeal
                            620(x) will, at the very least, mean a serious setback to efforts to
                            reach a negotiated solution to the Cyprus issue. At worst, it could mean
                                <gloss target="#t_UDI_1">UDI</gloss> and/or partition of the

                            party and stating that Turkey is crucial to the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> defense posture, that Turkey’s economic and military
                            strength are very important to the United States and that anything we
                            can do to ensure development of this strength we wish to do. The
                            President observed that the arms embargo is the most important immediate
                            issue, stating, “I am determined to do our utmost to remove the arms
                            embargo and reopen completely normal relations.” The President stressed
                            that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Government had continued
                            to do its best to satisfy Turkey’s military needs within the leeway
                            allowed by the law. He also noted that we understood the delicacy of
                            linkage between the embargo and Cyprus. He said he considered Aegean
                            questions were fundamental, but since the focus of attention has been on
                            Cyprus, progress on Cyprus takes on an exaggerated importance. He said
                            that recent statements by the Turkish side on Cyprus had perhaps not
                            received the notice they deserved and urged the Prime Minister,
                            especially in forthcoming meetings with the Congress, to be as specific
                            as possible about Turkish willingness to negotiate on Cyprus and
                            flexible on relations with Greece.</p>

                            public statements he had tried to tone down his anxieties and avoid
                            emotionalizing. He had learned from President Inönü, he said, that if
                            you permit emotions to build up over international issues they may get
                            out of your control. He did not wish, therefore, to indulge in tactical
                            maneuvering. He felt, nevertheless, that he must be frank in explaining
                            to the President the problems Turkey faced. He went on to expound at
                            length how Greece had blocked Turkish efforts to negotiate and his
                            conviction that Greece wished to crush Turkey under <gloss

                            that Israel had violated <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> arms-use
                            laws more than Turkey had, but Turkey was treated differently. He said
                            he had been frustrated in his efforts at Montreux to get <gloss

                            Turkey and <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> had refused
                            to meet with Denktaş or join a four-way meeting with <persName
                                corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName>. He reiterated issues on
                            which the Turkish side is ready to negotiate in Cyprus, emphasizing that
                            six areas are subject to territorial adjustment as well as the security
                            zone comprising 3% of Cyprus; he repeated the position on resettlement
                            of Varosha. On constitutional arrangements he described the bizonal
                            federal formula as one which he hoped would permit evolution into a
                            “more closely knit unit.” <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName> was trying to go back from the realistic

                                >Makarios</persName> and Denktaş, he said. While <persName

                            could not influence <persName corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName>, he
                            could not make this claim in respect to <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"

                            <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> spoke with strong feeling
                            about Greek intentions to carry the quarrel with Turkey into the <gloss

                            he had the same problem. The Prime Minister then said to the President,
                            “But you have not yet come out openly on this matter with the exception
                            of an answer to a question in a veterans’ meeting—we get the impression
                            that Turkey does not rate high enough in the list of priorities of the
                            Administration; it comes after Panama and Saudi Arabia.”</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister summed up his situation by referring to his cultural
                            attachment to the West and the legacy of <persName corresp="#p_AMK_2"
                                >Atatürk</persName> and said, “Unless you do something more
                            effective and concrete—unless the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                            Council ends up with a clear attitude on this problem—there will be deep
                            disappointment in Turkey. A Congressional decision with humiliating
                            strings attached would be worse than no decision at all. The position
                            you adopted in April would be perfectly acceptable. There are rumors
                            that strings may be attached . . . this would have extremely negative
                            effects on Turkish public opinion.”</p>
                        <p>The President stressed that we do not underestimate the seriousness of
                            Turkish concern and emphasized that the Administration is marshalling
                            all its influence in the Congress to ensure the removal of the arms
                            embargo. He said that he had recently had the leaders of the House and
                            the Senate around the same table to discuss these matters<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d116fn3">No record of this meeting was found.</note> and
                            recalled that he had already dealt with two major foreign policy
                            challenges this year—the Panama treaties and the Middle East arms sales
                            issue. Both proposals had originally been regarded as doomed to defeat
                            and the Panama issue was the most difficult with which he had ever
                            dealt. No domestic lobbies were available to help the Panamanians or
                            Saudis and there were strong domestic forces ranged against them, like
                            the Greek groups who want to continue the arms embargo. But a major
                            element of strength was the constructive attitude taken by the
                            governments of Panama and Saudi Arabia; their public statements were
                            designed to harmonize with our own. “Your knowledge of our country is a
                            great advantage to you,” the President told the Prime Minister; “My
                            belief is that with your help we can succeed.” The President <pb n="365"
                                facs="0397" xml:id="pg_365"/>went on to say that he largely agreed
                            with the Prime Minister’s estimate of Greek motives but that this did
                            not deter him.</p>
                        <p>The President encouraged Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                >Ecevit</persName> to make maximum use of opportunities such as the
                            National Press Club speech on June 1 and interviews with major
                            publications to underscore the facts and the constructive character of
                            Turkey’s position.<note n="4" xml:id="d116fn4">

                                maintain the arms embargo.</note> He suggested, if the Prime
                            Minister wished, that he seek the advice of Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> or others on the American side
                            to ensure that his National Press Club speech was formulated in the most
                            constructive way possible and underscored all the points of strength in
                            Turkey’s stance. We can, in turn, do our part by focusing American
                            public opinion on the positive side of these issues, the President
                            pointed out. The President then observed that our position would be
                            easier if Turkey could see fit to make further reductions in its troop
                            strength in Cyprus, for it was important, the President said, for
                            Congressional leaders to get the accurate impression that Turkey
                            genuinely wants to settle the Cyprus issue.</p>
                        <p>The President asked the Prime Minister about possibilities of meeting
                            with <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> and Denktaş, or
                            with <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName>. In subsequent
                            discussion, the President emphasized that further proposals for such
                            meetings, even if the Greek side does not accept them, could impact
                            favorably on Congress. The President complimented the Prime Minister on
                            the favorable impression he had made the evening before on Senator
                                <persName corresp="#p_NS_1">Nunn</persName>. The President said we
                            would be presenting the arms embargo problem to the Armed Services
                            Committee next week and regarded this as a very important step, for the
                            issue, tactically, had to be handled as a military matter. The President
                            urged the Prime Minister to be positive in his public comments on <gloss
                                target="#t_PM_1">PM</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName>, to stress Turkey’s
                            commitment to <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> and to avoid
                            threats to move toward the Soviets which would have a negative impact in
                            Congress.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> underscored what
                            the President had said by appealing to the Prime Minister to be
                            open-minded and flexible about meetings with Denktaş and <persName
                                corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName>, and <persName

                            <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> explained that politics
                            among Turkish Cypriots placed certain constraints upon him. He could not
                            let Turkish Cypriots get the impression that he was taking decisions
                            without consulting them. There was further discussion of interviews in
                            the American press, especially in <hi rend="italic">Newsweek</hi> and

                                >Vance</persName> offered advice and help in respect to these.</p>
                        <p>As the hour drew to a close, the Prime Minister declared, “I will do my
                            best. I have so much confidence in you, Mr. President, that I believe
                            you will do a superb job. This has been a very constructive meeting. I
                                <pb n="366" facs="0398" xml:id="pg_366"/>can see much more clearly
                            your concerns which you describe very well.” The President commented
                            that the Prime Minister of course knew best how far he could go on
                            constitutional and territorial questions and repeated his advice that
                                <gloss target="#t_PM_1">PM</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> do everything in his
                            power, while in America, to get the reasonableness and seriousness of
                            his position across to the American public and members of the Congress.
                            The President emphasized again that he would do everything he could to
                            help and said we wanted to work very closely with the Prime Minister’s
                            representatives here during the coming weeks.</p>
                        <p>“There is a limit to what we can do at once in Congress,” the President
                            replied; “it is now coming to the top of our list.” The Prime Min<pb
                                n="364" facs="0399" xml:id="pg_364"/>ister complained that <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> had also been too passive on the
                            embargo issue. The equipment of the Turkish army is now close to 50%
                            ineffective, he said, and General <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1"
                                >Haig</persName>’s estimates were that by 1980 it would be 80%
                            obsolete. This was an intolerable situation for <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> itself when other countries were
                            being heavily armed in the Middle East, which is full of explosive
                            problems. The Prime Minister underscored the Turkish commitment to
                            democracy and development. If his present government failed to secure
                            the conditions for keeping Turkey on this path, as it had been ever
                            since WWII, the likelihood that democracy could continue in Turkey was
                            not good. He concluded his remarks on this problem by saying, “If
                            something does not happen soon, we will do our best not to drift away
                            too much. . . but the measures we would have to take for our security
                            could not be dissociated from our political posture. Mr. <persName

                        <p>SUMMARY: Senator <persName corresp="#p_SPS_1">Sarbanes</persName> and
                            Congressmen <persName corresp="#p_BJ_1">Brademas</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_RBS_1">Rosenthal</persName> expressed
                            disappointment that the recent Turkish proposals on Cyprus had not been
                            more forthcoming.<note n="2" xml:id="d117fn2">See <ref target="#d113fn6"
                                    >footnote 6, Document 113</ref>.</note> They thought an opening
                            unilateral concession, such as returning Varosha outright to the
                            Greek-Cypriots, would have facilitated negotiations and swept aside
                            opposition to lifting the arms embargo. Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> responded by reviewing the
                            Cyprus problem since 1974, stressing that the August 1974 Turkish
                            military move had been the direct result of Greek intransigence in
                            Geneva, coupled with an immediate threat to Turkish-Cypriots on the
                            island. The Prime Minister stressed that he would pursue a solution
                            regardless of what action Congress took on <pb n="367" facs="0400"
                                xml:id="pg_367"/>the embargo. He underlined that Varosha’s political
                            future was open to negotiation. He felt strongly that direct
                            negotiations between the two communities were the best way to solve the
                            Cyprus problem. The Prime Minister argued vigorously that the arms
                            embargo is an impediment to negotiations. Following the meeting
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LJF_1">Leonard</persName> outlined to
                            Senator <persName corresp="#p_SPS_1">Sarbanes</persName> and Congressmen
                                <persName corresp="#p_BJ_1">Brademas</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_RBS_1">Rosenthal</persName> the dilemma of the embargo:
                            maintain it and negotiations will probably remain deadlocked; lift it
                            and at least Varosha will probably be recovered, though no one can be
                            sure what else might be achieved. END SUMMARY.</p>
                        <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_BJ_1">Brademas</persName> opened the
                            discussion by reviewing his own positions on Greek-Turkish relations and
                            Cyprus. He pointed out that he, like Representatives <persName
                                corresp="#p_SPS_1">Sarbanes</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_RBS_1">Rosenthal</persName>, had been a vigorous critic
                            of the Greek Junta and that he was on record publicly to express
                            understanding of the first Turkish military action in Cyprus in July
                            1974. He had been strongly critical of the second Turkish action in
                            August and his subsequent support of the embargo on <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> military assistance to Turkey had been
                            for him quite natural, given the importance he attached to scrupulous
                            fulfillment of our laws governing the use of <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> weapons.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BJ_1">Brademas</persName> said that he had been a
                            strong admirer of the Prime Minister and was very sympathetic to his
                            program for internal reform and progress in Turkey. In fact, he said, he
                            and his colleagues considered themselves to be “social democrats” and
                            they had, therefore, been very pleased when the Prime Minister had
                            succeeded in forming a government and they had been very hopeful that a
                            new Turkish policy on Cyprus would make it possible for them to follow
                            their own desires to vote for arms for Turkey. They recognized the
                            importance of Turkey in <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> and of a
                            strong <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The Congressman drew attention to the initiative from the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Administration to add an extra
                            $50-million to the <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> allocation for
                            Turkey last year, an initiative they had hoped would make it easier for
                            the Turkish Government to come forward with helpful proposals. In spite
                            of this, there had been no movement whatsoever from the previous
                            government and he was quite disappointed at what had been put forward so
                            far by the <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>
                            Administration.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_SPS_1">Sarbanes</persName> followed up the
                                <persName corresp="#p_BJ_1">Brademas</persName> presentation with
                            endorsement of its general thrust and added his own particular praise
                            for the Prime Minister’s record and general orientation. He had to say
                            in all frankness, however, that he found the Turkish proposals put
                            forward by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> to be not
                            meaningful. He recognized that the Turks were describing them as simply
                            “opening positions”, but the very serious doubts and suspicions harbored
                            by the Greek side could only be overcome if there was something more
                            concrete than had been offered <pb n="368" facs="0401" xml:id="pg_368"
                            />so far. In particular, he thought it had been a great mistake that the
                            Turkish side had not offered what he called a “loss leader”—that is, a
                            unilateral concession—as a means of making it clear that they were
                            serious and flexible and that the negotiations would be pursued in a
                            sincere fashion. He said that as an example, but only an example, he
                            thought it would have been highly desirable if the Turks had offered
                            simply to give back Varosha to the Greek Cypriots, even before sitting
                            down to negotiate the remaining problems. Such an offer from the Turkish
                            side would have, he said, swept away opposition to the lifting of the
                            embargo.</p>
                        <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_RBS_1">Rosenthal</persName> reiterated
                            many of the same points, adding that it was not merely his colleagues in
                            Congress who saw the Turkish proposals as not being meaningful, but it
                            was also public opinion in Western Europe and the United States and the
                            most senior officials of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            Administration.</p>
                        <p>After these three opening statements had been made, taking about one-half
                            hour, Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> gave
                            an extended review of his attitude toward the Cyprus problem, beginning
                            with his effort in early 1974 to open a dialogue with the Greek Junta.
                            The Junta had simply refused to engage in any dialogue and instead he
                            found himself faced with the “Samson Coup.” He had immediately gone to
                            London and had urged the United Kingdom Government to join him in the
                            action which was appropriate, given their status as guarantors of the
                            Cyprus agreements.<note n="3" xml:id="d117fn3">See <ref target="#d8fn3"
                                    >footnote 3, Document 8</ref>.</note> The <gloss
                                target="#t_UKG_1">UKG</gloss> had refused and he had therefore taken
                            action alone, as was Turkey’s right under those agreements. Turkey then
                            had gone to the Geneva negotiations with its military forces on Cyprus
                            in a very precarious position. They were occupying only a narrow
                            corridor between Kyrenia and Nicosia. Moreover, there were pockets of
                            Turkish Cypriots surrounded by Greek forces at several places including
                            the castle of Famagusta. These Turks were in serious danger of being
                            massacred. In the light of these dangers, Turkey had offered at Geneva
                            to accept a repositioning of military forces, which would have placed
                            broad zones occupied by the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> between
                            Turks and Greeks and would have obviated the dangers to the surrounded
                            Turkish civilians. The Greeks had, however, been flatly negative to
                            these proposals and he had, therefore, been compelled to make the August
                            military move. He explained he was going into this in such detail
                            because he had encountered on many occasions the attitude reflected by
                                <persName corresp="#p_BJ_1">Brademas</persName>; the understanding
                            of the first Turkish action combined with the condemnation of the
                            second.</p>

                            at this point to say that as a practical politician he could understand

                            Junta.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> responded that that might
                            well be the case, but that the political situation in Athens was hardly
                            the fault of the Turks, in fact the Greeks owed the Turks quite a debt
                            for bringing about a situation which enabled them to regain their
                            democratic freedoms. In any case, he said, he found that following the
                            August events, he—on his side—did not have the political freedom,
                            because of the attitude of one of his coalition partners, to take those
                            actions which he felt Turkey should take to solve the Cyprus problem. He
                            had therefore given up the government and had, with regret, noted the
                            paralysis that had come over the whole Cyprus question since that
                            time.</p>
                        <p>Despite the fact that it would have been easier to solve the problem in
                            1974 than it was now, he had come back into office determined to find a
                            solution. <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> stated very
                            strongly that he was seeking a solution for Cyprus, not in order to get
                            the embargo lifted, but because Greece and Turkey were neighbors and it
                            was imperative to live in peace together and to solve their problems
                            themselves. He would, therefore, pursue a solution for Cyprus no matter
                            what Congress did about the embargo question. In seeking a solution, he
                            had encouraged Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> to
                            put forward proposals and when these proposals were not properly
                            understood, he had himself made it clear that the Turkish side was
                            prepared to be flexible and had encouraged Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> to do the same. Both he and
                                <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> were very clearly on
                            public record on this matter. He also pointed out that Varosha had not
                            been treated in any detailed way in the Turkish-Cypriot proposals and
                            that as further evidence of Turkish good faith he had encouraged
                            subsequent clarification which added the element that Greek-Cypriots in
                            numbers of up to 30- to 35-thousand would be free to return to Varosha
                            once negotiations were underway.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_SPS_1">Sarbanes</persName> interjected that
                            the Turkish proposal on Varosha was not seen as a meaningful one, since
                            it envisaged Greek-Cypriots coming back to live under Turkish rule.
                                <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> responded to this that
                            both he and <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> had made
                            clear that the political framework under which Varosha would eventually
                            be placed was a completely open question.</p>
                        <p>For almost two hours the above themes were reiterated and elaborated upon
                            by the Prime Minister and the three gentlemen from Washington. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SPS_1">Sarbanes</persName>, in particular, backed up by
                                <persName corresp="#p_BJ_1">Brademas</persName>, presented the need
                            for a “front-end concession” to demonstrate the sincerity of the Turkish
                            side in the negotiations.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister reiterated in a number of ways his point that these
                            negotiations were best handled directly between Greeks and Turks, and
                            that it was not the best way to solve the problem to “have us <pb
                                n="370" facs="0403" xml:id="pg_370"/>negotiating here” on the Cyprus
                            matter. In fact, he pointed out, the effect of the existence of the
                            embargo is to prevent true negotiations. The Greek side bends all of its
                            tactics to preventing the embargo from being lifted and for this reason
                            they refuse to come to the table and test the sincerity of the Turkish
                            side in a normal way. President <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName> and his associates, <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> asserted, are not interested in
                            any near-term or reasonable solution to the Cyprus problem, but rather
                            wish to keep the embargo up for a number of years in the hope of
                            restoring the status quo ante-1974.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BJ_1">Brademas</persName> and Company did not take
                            issue with this analysis but underlined that the Turkish side had it
                            within its power to expose the Greek tactic if it was as described by
                            the Prime Minister. Congressman <persName corresp="#p_RBS_1"
                                >Rosenthal</persName>, in particular, seemed to take the Prime
                            Minister’s point that the embargo was preventing negotiations rather
                            than facilitating them and reiterated many times “we want out” of this
                            uncomfortable position between the two sides.</p>
                        <p>Among the elements discussed, but not really focused on, were the various
                            possibilities for arranging an encounter between <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>
                            indicated a willingness to meet with <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName> but not in a format that would “destroy
                                <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName>.”</p>
                        <p>The discussion, in spite of its circularity and constant replowing of old
                            ground, was almost never hostile. The Congressional group and the Prime
                            Minister took sharp issue with each other on many points, but on neither
                            side was there anything resembling anger. The discussion ended in an
                            inconclusive fashion.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LJF_1">Leonard</persName> accompanied
                            the Washington group to a restaurant and discussed briefly with them
                            what might be done next. He underlined that it seemed to him that the
                            supporters of the embargo faced what he recognized was a difficult
                            dilemma—if they maintained the embargo it was not likely these
                            negotiations would go forward and the Greek-Cypriot refugees would gain
                            nothing for years or perhaps forever. On the other hand, if they lifted
                            the embargo, it was likely that they could regain Varosha for the
                            Greek-Cypriots, but they would simply have to take their chances on
                            Turkish flexibility toward remaining territorial questions and the
                            constitution. It would of course be difficult to reimpose an embargo
                            after it had been lifted.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BJ_1">Brademas</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_RBS_1">Rosenthal</persName> seemed much more receptive
                            to this analysis than <persName corresp="#p_SPS_1">Sarbanes</persName>,
                            whose attention seemed concentrated on the “errors of the past” rather
                            than where we go from here.</p>
                        <p>The following morning in a conversation with Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_TI_1">Turkmen</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_LJF_1"
                                >Leonard</persName> was told that the Prime Minister had been quite
                            pleased by the whole conversation and had not at all been angered by the
                            strong and frank tone taken by the three Americans.</p>

                            to persuade Congress of the importance of removing the embargo. It is
                            essential that the Administration move forward in this effort. He noted
                            that on 4 June during his interview on FACE THE NATION, he had been able
                            to work in a reference to the effort even though the question had not
                            been asked. At a cabinet meeting on June 5 the President had stated that
                            the embargo question has the highest priority.<note n="2"

                            </hi> said that since the embargo is the cause of the present difficulty
                            in our relationship, he appreciates the stand that Secretary <persName

                                corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> have taken. He noted that he is
                            hopeful of a promising result, and that he will continue his own
                            efforts. Neither country can allow the suspension to continue, since the
                            suspension has lasted too long already. The balance of detente (sic)
                                [<hi rend="italic">defense</hi>?] must be maintained on the
                            Southeastern flank in order to counter the Soviet threat. Serious
                            consequences will result from the formation of a vacuum in the Turkish
                            area. But stability must be based on deterrence, not on lofty words.
                            Even if the embargo is lifted, however, we must consider a new concept
                            and structure. It must be based upon new political conditions, the new
                            feeling in <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>, and changes in the
                            international situation and in military considerations. The military
                            must be streamlined and made more efficient and not constitute a burden
                            on the economy, but act as a spur to the economy.</p>
                        <p>There are joint measures that the US and Turkey can take to improve the
                            situation. Turkey has been handicapped by restricted outside supply
                            sources and too much dependence on a single source. The Prime Minister
                            stated that he would like to see that dependence eased by Turkey’s being
                            included in co-production schemes as with European nations. Such
                            arrangements would involve technology transfers, foreign payment
                            supports and formation of new industries. However, such a scheme of
                            interdependence would allay concerns of the people of other allied
                            countries as to which direction Turkey would go. There is obviously a
                            close relationship between industry and defense; that is, a heavy
                            defense structure cannot be built on a weak economy. Turkey would like
                            the US to be more aware of that relationship in the future. <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> pointed out that in certain
                            areas Turkey can export military equipment to the Allies, as well as
                            supply some of her own needs. He mentioned that he had suggested to
                            President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> that this
                            offshore purchasing system could give new economic impetus. It would be
                            possible to enlarge several industries in Turkey in order both to meet
                            Turkish needs and to supply other Allies. Examples are the manufacture
                            of rockets, anti-tank munitions, and communications and electronic
                            equipment, including co-production. Additionally, Turkish shipyards
                            could build submarines for Allies and other friendlies. Repair and
                            modernization facilities in Turkey could be enlarged, but financial
                            assistance would be required, under appropriate provisions of the North
                            Atlantic Treaty.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> stated that apart from
                            these industrial matters, the Turkish Armed Forces need to be discussed.
                            As General <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> noted, the
                            Turkish Armed Forces have lost about 50% of their effectiveness,
                            primarily because of lack of needed material such as T–38 training
                            aircraft. It would be helpful if the US could find a way to assist in
                            this area, even <pb n="373" facs="0406" xml:id="pg_373"/>before the
                            embargo is lifted. He further noted that he appreciated Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Brown</persName>’s contribution to the
                            reorganization issue discussed at the recent Ministerial in Brussels. A
                            continuing need exists for <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> air
                            training facilities in Turkey. He noted that Turkish pilots formerly won
                            almost all <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> contests, but are now
                            suffering from a lack of proficiency and a decrease in morale.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister emphasized what he considers the worst bottleneck
                            currently affecting defense and <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                            cooperation—a shortage of infrastructure construction in Turkey. He
                            believes this results from a lack of interest in <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>, as well as neglect by the Turkish
                            economy. Such infrastructure projects include pipelines, port
                            facilities, airfields, and storage facilities. Unless priority is given
                            this important area, Turkey’s reinforcement reception capability will be
                            seriously affected. Assistance is required either bilaterally or through
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the economic problems, a serious problem exists in the
                            definition of areas of responsibility in the Aegean. No-one in <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>, Turkey, or Greece knows his area of
                            responsibility, and confusion would exist if something happened in the
                            Aegean area.</p>
                        <p>In regard to the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>, the Prime Minister
                            stated that Turkey would be willing to negotiate immediately after the
                            embargo is lifted. There is no legal basis for resumption of base
                            operations, but the situation could be handled. The joint US-Turkish
                            facilities, particularly the identification, control and communications
                            facilities, are important for security purposes, as well as <gloss
                                target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_MBFR_1"
                                >MBFR</gloss>, etc. The Soviets think such facilities are a
                            provocation, but <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> said that
                            he sees them as serving peaceful purposes. In any case, the Turks would
                            have no objection in principle to resumption of talks immediately after
                            the embargo is lifted.</p>

                            </hi> told the Prime Minister that he would respond to the points that
                            he had raised, but necessarily in varying degrees of specificity. He
                            stated that we understand and agree with the need for the Turkish
                            economy to support defense needs. This in turn would mean that the
                            Turkish Armed Forces would be better able to carry out their <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> role. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH_1">Brown</persName> said that once the embargo is
                            lifted a joint planning study should be the first step. The State
                            Counselor raised this point last February, as well as the question of
                            Turkey’s defense industry capability for meeting its own and Allied
                                requirements.<note n="4" xml:id="d118fn4">During a February 23

                                    >Nimetz</persName> added that no such study should commence

                            Defense Department to look at these points. He pointed out to <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> the importance of private

                            is not the only way out. The tank repair and modernization facilities,
                            etc., would be part of it. <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DoD</gloss> experts
                            will visit and look at those facilities at the appropriate time. This
                            will not solve the balance of payments problem; it will be a long time
                            before Turkey will be able to manufacture modern aircraft, for
                            example.</p>
                        <p>The matter of joint training facilities also came up at the <gloss
                                target="#t_DPC_1">DPC</gloss>. It is imperative to have joint
                            training facilities in Europe, not to replace existing facilities but as
                            a supplement. In regard to military infrastructure, Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH_1">Brown</persName> suggested that Turkish planners
                            participate with the planners of other Allies in the Long Term Defense
                            Program. Whatever is accomplished in this area will be accomplished
                            through this structure. Concerning the Aegean, General <persName
                                corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> is working hard with both Turkish
                            and Greek leaders. The problem is obviously not solved yet, but these
                            discussions have so far prevented the political problems from worsening.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Brown</persName> agreed that we
                            should move forward on the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> as soon
                            as possible, but such movement obviously could occur only after the
                            embargo is lifted. However, in the interim, he believes we will be able
                            to establish a working arrangement. He summarized his remarks by noting
                            that the Administration is working hard with Congress in order to
                            address the important elements that the Prime Minister had
                            introduced.</p>

                            confronting us. He further stated that our joint planning efforts, even
                            in rudimentary form, will aid considerably later this year when Turkey
                            is developing its new strategy plan. It will give the Turks
                            confidence.</p>

                        <p>There have been some indications from our Congressional supporters, for
                            example <persName corresp="#p_ZCJ_1">Zablocki</persName>, and from those
                            leaning against us, for example <persName corresp="#p_GBA_1">Ben

                            is likely to be sustained unless Turkey quickly makes further
                            constructive moves. There are a number of areas where the Turks could
                            theoretically offer concessions either unilaterally or diplomatically.
                            The Turks would greatly prefer that any additional movement by them be
                            related to matching moves from the other side <hi rend="italic">and</hi>
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>. Such responses are very unlikely

                            First, <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> and the foreign
                            policy leadership group will be in Moscow and pretty much out of touch
                            until June 25. Second, <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>
                            would clearly ask whether any suggested concession(s) would be
                            sufficient, in the manner of the <persName corresp="#p_DDW_1"
                                >DeConcini</persName> reservation, to swing the vote to Turkey’s

                            Unfortunately, there is no group in the Congress in a position to assure
                            us or the Turks that any single concession or package of concessions
                            would suffice to win the day. Third, <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                >Ecevit</persName> has been tremendously impressed by the
                            President’s determination to press Congress hard on the embargo and
                            would regard our asking for more Turkish concessions so soon after his
                            Washington visit as a sign that the Administration’s commitment is not
                            genuine. Fourth, the Greek Cypriots have given no indication that they
                            would respond positively to any realistically possible Turkish gesture
                                <hi rend="italic">until after</hi> the embargo is voted up or down
                            in Congress. Moreover, no matter what the Turks might do, it is very
                            doubtful that <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> would
                            call upon the Greek <pb n="376" facs="0409" xml:id="pg_376"/>Cypriots to
                            attend intercommunal negotiations until he is sure they would accept and
                            he is convinced this will not happen while the embargo question is

                        <p>We have already discussed the following items with the parties and have a

                            <hi rend="italic">Turkish Troop Withdrawals.</hi> In the President’s
                            meeting with <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>, the Prime
                            Minister was told that a dramatic reduction might be significant.
                                <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> recounted the 16,000
                            troop withdrawals that have taken place since the 1974 invasion. The
                            Turks assert that in the context of a final settlement essentially all
                            of their troops will be withdrawn and that in the interim they envisage
                            continuing phased incremental withdrawals. (COMMENT: These withdrawals
                            tend to be so small and so ineptly announced as to have no public
                            impact.) <persName corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName> in his
                            meeting with the President criticized the presence of Turkish forces,
                            but signalled that a reduction of even 10,000–15,000 would not change
                            the balance on the island or Turkey’s position as an occupying

                            Greek Cypriots. Even though the Greek side would denigrate any Turkish
                            withdrawal, it would have some effect in the Congress.</p>

                                corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> in his latest Cyprus report
                            indicated that the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> could
                            appropriately help facilitate the return of Greek Cypriots to Varosha.
                            We have been floating such an idea with the Turkish side, with our
                            Western allies and with the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> for the
                            past month. The Greek side has, however, shown no interest in a package
                            deal for Varosha which would include their agreeing to resumption of
                            intercommunal negotiations. The ideas in our non-paper were also floated
                            with the <persName corresp="#p_BJ_1">Brademas</persName> group and they
                            have not responded.<note n="4" xml:id="d119fn4">Presumably a draft of
                                the “non-paper” described in <ref target="#d61fn2">footnote 2,

                            publicly call upon the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> to
                            rehabilitate and administer Varosha once talks resume. This would have
                            some impact. Or, the Turkish side could make explicit that Varosha will
                            be returned to Greek Cypriot control. A clear statement to this effect
                            would truly be significant, but it would be seen in Turkey as a new
                            concession and would be resisted by <persName corresp="#p_DR_1"

                            this proposal. Our preliminary view is that this is only a superficially
                            attractive idea. If there were a “unitary” police force serving
                            throughout Cyprus, it would severely undermine the Turkish goal of
                            equality between the two communities with substantial autonomy for each
                            zone. On the other hand, if this new police force was structured so that
                            the Turkish component (some 20% of total) would serve only in the north
                            and the 80% Greek component only in the south, such a force would be
                            offensive to the Greeks. This does not appear to be a proposal that
                            could be developed in the next week or so.</p>

                            albeit with clearly prescribed and limited powers. Specific examples of

                            only help us in Congress if we could also in some way either get the

                            has just indicated its willingness to negotiate a bilateral agreement
                            along the lines of an existing European convention. Ambassador <persName

                            ago and determined that we could not adhere to it. I have asked the
                            Legal Bureau to look at it again to see if we can use it to build an
                            acceptable bilateral agreement which will accomplish our purposes. If
                            so, we will work towards an early joint announcement of negotiations.
                            Success in this venture would be seen as a positive Turkish move by at
                            least three Congressmen.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Conclusion</p>
                        <p>If we decide to push the Turks for additional very specific concessions
                            and gestures, we must realize that—assuming we succeed—the Turks may
                            comply in a manner that does not convince the “leaners” and undecideds
                            and that the Greek side will probably not respond positively. The
                            greatest impact in the Congress would result from a public signal by the
                            Administration that the Turks are now being forthcoming and moderate on
                            Cyprus but that the Greek side is not responding because they prefer
                            maintenance of the embargo to negotiations. This would be a difficult
                            domestic political choice for the Administration and would also impact
                            on our future ability to follow a balanced, diplomatic approach in the
                            area.</p>

                        <p>While we might still seek some of the above concessions on their merits,
                            we might earn more credit—at less risk—were we to focus our efforts on
                            convincing the Congress, the Greek Americans and the Greeks and Cypriots
                            that we have not abandoned the Cyprus problem. This could be done by
                            announcing that as soon as the embargo is lifted, we will undertake new
                            diplomatic initiatives in conjunction with the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss> and with those in Europe who share our concern to seek a
                            prompt resolution of the Cyprus problem. We would make clear that after
                            the embargo is lifted, we will join our friends in making substantive
                            suggestions which will help the two parties negotiate in a sustained and
                            flexible manner. I believe the Europeans, in any event the British and
                            the Germans, think a more substantive third party role will be required
                            and would be pleased to join us in such an effort.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>One question we are encountering in urging Senators and Congressmen to
                            vote to lift the Turkish embargo is whether it would result in practical
                            advantages to the Turkish military. Since we are stressing the
                            deterioration of the Turkish defense forces, it is important to show how
                            the lifting of the embargo will arrest the deterioration. Thus, while
                            calling attention to the political and symbolic significance of lifting
                            the embargo, we should also emphasize the following specific military
                            benefits:</p>
                        <p>—Approximately $70 million in equipment financed under the military
                            assistance grant program before the embargo was imposed will be released
                            from the pipeline. Most of these items are in storage and can be
                            delivered quickly.<note n="2" xml:id="d120fn2">In the right-hand margin

                        </p>
                        <p>—We will be able to give permission to our European allies to sell or
                            transfer US-origin or licensed equipment to Turkey. The Germans, the
                            Dutch and others have aircraft and other equipment which we know they
                            would be willing to transfer to Turkey once the embargo is lifted.</p>
                        <p>—We will be able to resume military training for Turkish personnel in the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>—an item of great importance to
                            the Turks.</p>
                        <p>—There will no longer be an annual ceiling on Foreign Military Sales
                            transactions with Turkey. While we have sought only $175 million in
                            credit authority in 1979 (same as in 1978), with the lifting of the
                            embargo Turkey can make additional cash purchases through Defense
                            Department channels.</p>
                        <p>—Finally, we will be able to intensify joint planning with Turkish
                            military authorities to find ways to work together in the future to deal
                            with Turkey’s force obsolescence problems.</p>

                        <p>While repeal of the embargo will have the above practical advantages in
                            bringing Turkey back to a position where it can play a full Alliance
                            role, repeal will not upset the Greek-Turkish military balance.<note

                        <p>Following several months of lobbying by White House, Department of State,
                            and Department of Defense officials, Congress agreed to overturn the
                            arms embargo against Turkey. The Senate voted 57–42 to lift the embargo
                            on July 25, 1978. The vote also approved $2.8 billion in foreign arms
                            sales to Turkey, and it included a requirement that the President issue
                            a report every two months to Congress on the status of the Cyprus
                            negotiations. This requirement, introduced by Senators <persName

                                <persName corresp="#p_MGS_1">George McGovern</persName> (D-South
                            Dakota), also stipulated that <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> arms
                            would be used “solely for defensive purposes” to enable both Turkey and
                            Greece to fulfill their <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                            obligations. (Graham Hovey, “Senate Acts to Lift Arms Ban on Turks, But

                            page 19) Later that day, the Department of State issued a statement
                            commending the Senate vote: “The lifting of the embargo will allow the
                            United States to proceed in an atmosphere of renewed trust to work
                            toward the strengthening of our relations with the countries of the
                            Eastern Mediterranean. The Administration will continue to exert every
                            effort to help bring about a just and lasting Cyprus solution, and to
                            help achieve peaceful solutions to problems in that region. The lifting
                            of the embargo will help promote the achievement of these important
                            policy goals.” The White House also issued a statement. (Department of
                            State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin,</hi> September 1978, page 34)</p>
                        <p>On August 1, the House voted to overturn the embargo with a narrower vote

                            was in the national interest and that Turkey was acting in good faith to
                            settle the Cyprus dispute. President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                >Carter</persName> issued a statement the same day welcoming the

                                    >Henze</persName> assumed that Congress would vote to overturn

                                should press Turkey to move ahead with Cyprus negotiations and to
                                maintain the momentum for negotiations between the Turkish and Greek
                                Cypriot communities. <persName corresp="#p_HPB_1">Henze</persName>
                                went on to note positive developments regarding the Aegean

                                atmosphere among Greek and Turkish officials regarding Greek

                                beneficial impact lifting the embargo would have on the ailing

                            Senate and signed by the President. He will then have to prepare a

                                Turkish officials contended that such a move was premature because

                            three other places as well, so as not to overdramatize the Turkish stop.
                            If you visit Turkey, you should also stop for a day in Greece.</p>

                        <p>3. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> said we were

                            reached an agreement on the second drawing under the Standby Agreement.
                            We were fully supportive of Turkish efforts to overcome its economic
                            problems. The Secretary said that the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> could not provide economic assistance of the magnitude
                            needed by Turkey and he believed that the most effective way was to
                            obtain such funds from private international financial markets. He then
                            asked how Turkish efforts to acquire new credits from the private banks
                            were progressing. <persName corresp="#p_OG_1">Okcun</persName> said that
                            the <gloss target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> wanted to put US-Turkish
                            relations into a broader framework which would not emphasize only the
                            defense relationship. There were other ways and means to expand
                            US-Turkish cooperation. He hoped <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                            would continue to encourage private banks and would also reactivate
                            Export-Import Bank lending to Turkey. The Secretary said the <gloss

                            decisions, although Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CRN_1"
                                >Cooper</persName> and others would continue in their contacts with

                        <p>4. In response to <persName corresp="#p_OG_1">Okcun</persName>’s question
                            whether a “program of action” could be prepared relating to ExIm Bank
                            activity in Turkey, the Secretary said this would have to be discussed
                            with the Bank, which through its board and senior staff would have to
                            decide whether new lending to Turkey was appropriate at this juncture.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> noted that with
                            apparent resolution of Turkey’s problems with <gloss target="#t_IMF_1"
                                >IMF</gloss>, rescheduling of official debt, and progress on working

                                >XMB</gloss> was already reviewing what if anything could now be
                            done. We would continue to discuss these matters with <gloss

                            could be done with regard to Turkey. In response to question, Secretary
                            said that if <gloss target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> wished to forward a
                            proposal, we and the <gloss target="#t_XMB_1">XMB</gloss> would be glad
                            to examine it.</p>
                        <p>5. Following a discussion of the prisoner transfer treaty negotiations
                                (<gloss target="#t_septel_1">septel</gloss>), and in response to a
                            question from <persName corresp="#p_OG_1">Okcun</persName>, the
                            Secretary said we were in the process of putting together the
                            administration’s <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1980 budget request.
                            Final assistance figures are not yet available, but Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> should not be
                            concerned that the aggregate assistance level for Turkey would cause him
                            any embarrassment. The Secretary stressed that he could not give a
                            figure and that the budget process was not yet completed. At this
                            point—approaching final determination—the program for Turkey looked
                            satisfactory and would probably include <gloss target="#t_FMS_1"
                                >FMS</gloss> credits, <gloss target="#t_MAP_1">MAP</gloss>, <gloss

                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_ES_1">Elekdag</persName> referred to the 1976
                                <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> supplementary list and urged
                            that the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> make this equipment
                            available for sale at the lowest avail<pb n="385" facs="0418"

                            account of Turkey’s difficult short-term balance of payments problem as

                            said that <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> was ready to receive a
                            Turkish military team to review Turkish requirements. Some of the 1976
                            equipment was no longer available, but we were prepared to give the
                            lowest possible prices consistent with our overall policies. We also
                            indicated that <gloss target="#t_MAP_1">MAP</gloss> materiel pipeline
                            items would be shipped expeditiously, some by air. The Turks could send
                            a military team to Washington as soon as they were ready, even during
                            the week of October 2.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_OG_1">Okcun</persName> referred to the
                            conversation in June between Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                >Ecevit</persName> and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Brown</persName> in Washington,<note n="4" xml:id="d123fn4">See
                                    <ref target="#d118">Document 118</ref>.</note> and hoped that
                            work could go forward to see what could be done in the defense
                            co-production area. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> said
                            that in the last few days we had made a proposal to send a team to
                            Ankara to see what might be possible, and that their visit could take
                            place in the coming weeks.</p>
                        <p>8. Reverting to Turkey’s financial situation, and re-responding to the
                            Secretary’s question, <persName corresp="#p_OG_1">Okcun</persName> said
                            that Finance Minister <persName corresp="#p_MZ_1">Muezzinoglu</persName>
                            was meeting in Washington Sept. 27 with representatives of the seven
                            large banks concerning both debt rescheduling and, hopefully, fresh
                            credits in the range of $500 million. Turkey faced acute problems over
                            the next ninety days which presented political risks to the Prime
                            Minister. Fresh credits from abroad were therefore essential. He hoped
                            that <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> support in this regard would
                            be forthcoming. The Secretary reiterated that Under Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_CRN_1">Cooper</persName> would keep in touch with the
                            banks as he had indicated he would do.</p>
                        <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_OG_1">Okcun</persName> asked for <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> support to make the <gloss
                                target="#t_OECD_1">OECD</gloss> consortium for Turkey more active,
                            particularly in exploring external financing possibilities for Turkey’s
                            fourth five-year plan, which was still under preparation for
                            presentation later to the National Assembly.<note n="5" xml:id="d123fn5"
                                >The <gloss target="#t_OECD_1">OECD</gloss> Consortium to Aid Turkey
                                was established in 1962.</note> The Secretary said he was not
                            familiar with the status of our thinking on the consortium, but we would
                            take note of Turkish interest in a more active consortium role.
                            Subsequently at lunch, <persName corresp="#p_ES_1">Elekdag</persName>
                            and <persName corresp="#p_EM_1">Esenbel</persName> said they recognized
                            that the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> could pledge at a
                            consortium meeting only what we would do in any event, but thought that
                            the consortium might be an effective way to encourage greater interest
                            in Turkey’s economic problems on the part of the other <gloss
                                target="#t_OECD_1">OECD</gloss> member countries.</p>
                        <p>10. In response to the Secretary’s repeated assurance of <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> support for <gloss target="#t_GOT_1"
                                >GOT</gloss> efforts to strengthen Turkey’s economy and his offer to
                            study carefully specific ways we might be able to demonstrate that
                            support, <persName corresp="#p_OG_1">Okcun</persName> asked whether the
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> could consider using its good
                                of<pb n="386" facs="0419" xml:id="pg_386"/>fices with Kuwait and
                            Saudi Arabia to encourage them to consider greater interest in Turkey’s
                            economic development.</p>
                        <p>11. <persName corresp="#p_ES_1">Elekdag</persName> referred to the many
                            US-Turkish conversations in 1978, and noted that he would be returning
                            to Ankara for the October 2 National Security Council meeting. <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> would be taking serious
                            political risks to reactivate immediately <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> installations unless he had a clear idea of what could
                            be expected from the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> in 1980. He
                            noted that the Secretary had indicated that the level of proposed
                            assistance would not cause <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>
                            embarrassment. Could he also tell the Prime Minister on his return that
                            it was expected that the assistance level would be adequate to Turkey’s
                            needs? The Secretary replied that he could so indicate, but we could not
                            be in a position of talking about precise figures at this stage, except
                            to indicate that we anticipated a level which would represent a material
                            advance over the level provided for in the 1976 <gloss target="#t_DCA_1"
                                >DCA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>12. In response to a question from <persName corresp="#p_OG_1"
                                >Okcun</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_VGS_1">Vest</persName> confirmed that the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> was prepared in principle to
                            work out the modalities to have Kargaburun and Belbasi transferred to
                            Turkish operation. We were waiting to hear further from the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_ES_1"
                                >Elekdag</persName> stressed that all of the facilities would be
                            reopened, but that discussion concerning the future of these two
                            installations should occur shortly.</p>
                        <p>13. With regard to Turkish-Greek relations, <persName corresp="#p_OG_1"
                                >Okcun</persName> said that there was concern in Ankara that the
                            repeated reiteration over the last several months of the “<persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> formulation” relating to the
                            Aegean had encouraged the Greek Government to slow down discussion of

                                the Greek-Turkish dispute over Aegean territorial rights. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_CIS_1">Çağlayangil</persName> called for the Aegean
                                to be split down the middle and divided evenly between Greece and
                                Turkey, with special negotiations to take place over Aegean islands
                                and areas suitable for joint exploration of natural
                                resources.</note> He hoped <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            would not encourage negative Greek attitude, which could lead to a
                            dragging out of the talks. The Secretary said that in our view goodwill
                            and a serious effort was required from both Turkey and Greece and we
                            certainly supported the objective of their resolving their
                            differences.</p>

                            hoped the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> would encourage others to

                            described his recent talks in Athens with Greek Secretary General

                                above.</note> He stressed that a key issue at present was the Greek
                            refusal to discuss the claimed 10 nautical mile territorial air space
                            around the Greek islands. He expressed fear that the Greeks had espoused
                            a policy of evading fundamental issues. The <gloss target="#t_GOT_1"
                                >GOT</gloss> would continue the dialogue, however, and hoped that
                            progress could be made. At lunch, <persName corresp="#p_ES_1"
                                >Elekdag</persName> gave a detailed description of the Turkish
                            position on the air space question along the same general lines provided
                            earlier to Embassy Ankara.</p>

                                >Okcun</persName> said that improved Turkish-US relations were even
                            more important than Turkish-Greek relations. He thought that with
                            continued confidence on both sides, a new chapter in cooperation was
                            possible. The Secretary agreed that we share that objective and want to
                            do all we can to achieve it.</p>

                        <p>This memorandum requests authorization pursuant to the Circular 175
                            Procedure (11 <gloss target="#t_FAM_1">FAM</gloss> 700) to negotiate an
                            agreement on the above subject. The issues for decision are whether
                            negotiations should proceed and, if so, what position should be taken by
                            the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Negotiators.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Essential Factors</p>
                        <p>In July 1975, the Government of Turkey unilaterally announced the
                            termination of the 1969 Defense Cooperation Agreement which had governed
                            the operation of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> military
                            facilities in Turkey. It also suspended primary mission operations at
                            those facilities which were not in direct support of <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> defense activities. The <gloss
                                target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> claimed that these actions were
                            justified by the arms embargo imposed pursuant to <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> law in February 1975.</p>
                        <p>A new defense cooperation agreement was signed on March 26, 1976. This
                            agreement was intended to permit resumption of suspended <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> operations and end the embargo.
                            However, its entry into force was expressly subject to the enactment of
                            implementing legislation because the agreement obliged the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> to provide specified amounts of
                            military assistance as well as foreign military sales and <gloss
                                target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> financing over a four year period, all
                            of which were then prohibited by the statutory embargo.</p>
                        <p>Implementing legislation was submitted to Congress in June 1976, but
                            Congress did not act on it and maintained the embargo in force until
                            September 1978. The present Administration did not press for enactment
                            of the multiyear military assistance and <gloss target="#t_FMS_1"
                                >FMS</gloss> credit package. <pb n="389" facs="0422" xml:id="pg_389"
                            />Early in 1978, after consultation with the Turkish Government, the
                            Administration decided that the 1976 agreement should not be used as a
                            basis for seeking a lifting of the embargo. Instead, it was decided that
                            a new defense agreement should be negotiated after the embargo had been
                            lifted.</p>
                        <p>Section 13(a) of the International Security Assistance Act of 1978
                                (<gloss target="#t_PL_1">P.L.</gloss> 95–384, approved September 26,
                            1978) authorized the President to make a determination which would cause
                            the embargo legislation to cease to have any force and effect. The
                            determination was signed on September 26, and transmitted to the
                            Congress. In response, on October 4, the Government of Turkey issued a
                            decree authorizing the resumption of suspended <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> operations for a transitional period of one year
                            starting on October 9. The decree specified interim conditions for
                            operations at all installations, pending the negotiation and entry into
                            force of a new agreement. (An exception is the major installation at
                            Karamursel, which we had already decided to close for our own
                            reasons.)</p>
                        <p>We have agreed with the Government of Turkey that negotiations should
                            begin in November. Early negotiations seem advantageous from our
                            standpoint because a very cooperative atmosphere in Turkey prevails now
                            that the embargo has ended. Moreover, a new agreement is needed to
                            remove restrictions still imposed on our operations. The <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> team would be led by Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_SRL_1">Spiers</persName>, and the Embassy
                            staff would be supported by policy and legal experts from State and
                            Defense. <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Negotiators would take the
                            following positions:</p>
                        <p>—The agreement should be confined, to the extent possible, to matters
                            related to <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> military activities in
                            Turkey. While we will, of course need to support Turkey’s <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> role through economic and security
                            assistance, it is our intention to make no commitments in this area and
                            to keep the agreement on military facilities separate and distinct from
                            discussions on these broad areas of defense cooperation. (We expect the
                            Turkish Government to press for a closer connection than we consider
                            desirable between <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> military
                            activities and questions of assistance.)</p>
                        <p>—The agreement, while providing the fundamental guarantees desired by
                            both sides, should be as broad as possible in its language, relying on
                            mutual good will and a process of pragmatic resolution of specific
                            problems rather than setting forth a complex set of detailed operating
                            rules.</p>
                        <p>—<gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> positions on specific issues will
                            be consistent with essential requirements and will take into account
                            agreements reached or to be negotiated on facilities elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>Negotiations on the new agreement will proceed in close consultation with
                            Department of Defense and other concerned agencies. When <pb n="390"
                                facs="0423" xml:id="pg_390"/>a text is agreed <hi rend="italic">ad

                            sought for its signature.</p>
                        <p>We do not anticipate the inclusion in the Agreement of any provisions
                            which will require the enactment of implementing legislation. Since the
                            Agreement will be in furtherance of the North Atlantic Treaty, an
                            executive agreement would seem appropriate. A Memorandum of Law is
                            attached. However, we will consult with the relevant committees of the
                            House and Senate and interested members of the Congress concerning both
                            the form and content of the Agreement prior to the commencement of
                            negotiations and as they proceed.</p>
                        <p>The circumstances of these negotiations, which will involve classified
                            drafts and documentation on both sides, will preclude the opportunity
                            for public comment in advance of conclusion of an agreed text and a
                            decision on its classification. Every effort will be made to produce an
                            unclassified agreement, with any necessarily classified subjects dealt
                            with in separate annexes.</p>

                                corresp="#p_LJM_1">Luns</persName> summarized his impressions of his
                            recent visit to Ankara and discussions with the Turkish Prime Minister,
                            the Foreign Minister, the Defense Minister, and the Chief of the Turkish
                            General Staff. <persName corresp="#p_LJM_1">Luns</persName> emphasized
                            that he was extremely well received in Ankara and that there were
                            absolutely no reproaches to <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                            officials or the Alliance at any time during the visit. In general, he
                            categorized Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>
                            as the most flexible Turkish official with whom he met and Defense
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_IHE_1">Isik</persName> the most negative
                            with the Foreign Minister only somewhat less constructive than the Prime
                            Minister. He noted that he had framed his visit to Ankara around a
                            liaison visit to <gloss target="#t_CENTO_1">CENTO</gloss> in order to
                            assuage Greek concerns but subsequently was informed that the Greeks
                            were delighted that he had visited Ankara. <persName corresp="#p_LJM_1"
                                >Luns</persName> described the multiple sessions with the Turkish
                            officials as arduous but of great value in that it was clear that the
                            Turks are now reassured of <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                            interest in their plight. In outlining the circumstances which led to
                            his visit, the Secretary General noted that as Secretary General of
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> it was incumbent upon him to
                            attempt to work the problem of Greek reintegration just as he had
                            earlier worked the problem surrounding the Icelandic fisheries
                                dispute.<note n="2" xml:id="d125fn2">Reference is to the third “Cod
                                War” in 1975 between Iceland and the United Kingdom over the size of

                                    >Luns</persName> mediated a dispute between the two countries,
                                which culminated in an agreement on fishing rights reached in June
                                1976.</note> He noted that in this regard he may have bruised
                            American feelings since clearly they had an initiative of their own
                            underway. He drew this conclusion both from the fact that <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWT_1">Bennett</persName> had delicately but effectively
                            urged him not to enter into details on Greek reentry while in Ankara.
                            After his arrival in Ankara, his discussions with Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_SRL_1">Spiers</persName> confirmed American sensitivity
                            and, as he had assured Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWT_1"
                                >Bennett</persName>, he provided <persName corresp="#p_SRL_1"
                                >Spiers</persName> an outline of the proposals he would make to the
                            Turkish side, emphasizing that they were not firm proposals but merely
                            “venting” points for subsequent consideration by the Turkish side.</p>
                        <p>2. In describing his proposals <persName corresp="#p_LJM_1"
                                >Luns</persName> made it clear that he had emphasized to the Turks
                            that there were absolutely no links between the Turkish economic plight
                            and the existing political issues between Greece and Turkey, including
                            Cyprus and Aegean command issues. He stated that the Turks were
                            delighted with this clarification and complained that in recent
                            discissions with the Canadians, Canada had emphasized the linkage
                            between help for Turkey economically and progress on Cyprus. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LJM_1">Luns</persName> also stated that during the
                            economic discussions the Turks complained bitterly about the <gloss
                                target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss>’s rigidity while praising World Bank
                            President <persName corresp="#p_MRS_1">McNamara</persName>’s forthcoming
                            response to Turkey’s economic needs. The Turks apparently are also
                            concerned <pb n="392" facs="0425" xml:id="pg_392"/>about the recent
                                <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> ruling which reduced support
                            for the children of Turkish guest workers by 50 percent, a step which
                            has resulted in 450,000 Turkish dependents entering the Federal Republic
                            to join their sponsors. The Secretary General noted that these young
                            people were neither “fish nor fowl” and could easily become tomorrow’s
                            revolutionaries.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_LJM_1">Luns</persName> then described his
                            military reintegration proposals in considerably less detail than he had
                            given them to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SRL_1">Spiers</persName>,
                            noting that they consisted of four basic steps. Before listing these,
                                <persName corresp="#p_LJM_1">Luns</persName> stated that he had
                            formulated the proposals as a result of studying papers associated with
                            the <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>-<persName
                                corresp="#p_DJ_1">Davos</persName> discussions and deliberations of

                                    target="#d184fn3">footnote 3, Document 184</ref>.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LJM_1">Luns</persName> noted that he had prepared
                            the proposal in conjunction with Deputy Secretary General <persName
                                corresp="#p_PR_1">Petrignani</persName> and mentioned having the
                            approval of several Ministers. He also referred to his authority
                            provided under the provisions of the watching brief agreed upon several
                            years ago. In discussing his four steps, <persName corresp="#p_LJM_1"
                                >Luns</persName> advised the Turks that the proposal should be
                            reviewed in the context of a clearly delineated disclaimer clause which
                            would emphasize that no juridical consequences would result from the
                            interim command arrangements. He also emphasized that his proposals were
                            designed to permit an early reentry for Greece and their acceptance
                            might also involve an obligation to convene a special group, perhaps
                            under the <gloss target="#t_DPC_1">DPC</gloss> or a group of nations,
                            which would seek to work with both sides in arriving at more permanent
                            arrangements. The four proposals as described by <persName
                                corresp="#p_LJM_1">Luns</persName> were:</p>
                        <p>One: procedures for the return to normal air traffic over the Aegean.</p>
                        <p>Two: Provision for cross tell from existing radar sites.</p>
                        <p>Three: An “ambiguous” sentence establishing the principle of the task
                            force naval command system to be effected when ships were assigned to
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> (<persName corresp="#p_LJM_1"
                                >Luns</persName> commented that this proposal really constituted no
                            change in day-to-day command arrangements).</p>
                        <p>Four: A proposal that <gloss target="#t_SACEUR_1">SACEUR</gloss> work out
                            command arrangements and boundaries to be applied in time of war.</p>
                        <p>4. Apparently the Turkish side remained essentially negative on the
                            reintegration steps throughout the visit, and Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> clearly rejected them on
                            Saturday afternoon during his final meeting with the Secretary General.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LJM_1">Luns</persName> stated that the Prime
                            Minister termed them unacceptable from the Turkish point of view but, as
                            a consequence of the Secretary General’s urgings, agreed to attempt to
                            undertake talks with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KK_1"
                                >Karamanlis</persName> before making an official <pb n="393"
                                facs="0426" xml:id="pg_393"/>and categorical rejection. <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> apparently agreed to this
                            additional step and <persName corresp="#p_LJM_1">Luns</persName> plans
                            to talk with the Greek side about such a meeting between the Prime
                            Ministers, sometime this week.</p>
                        <p>5. The remainder of the Secretary General’s briefing touched upon his
                            assessment of Turkey’s grave economic outlook which is clearly foremost
                            in his mind. He noted that it is evident that Turkey has become
                            increasingly reliant on economic and trade relations with the Soviet
                            Union which appears to be more willing than <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss> nations to meet Turkey’s needs. He noted that
                                <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> described the current
                            situation as the gravest ever faced by a democratic Turkey. Although
                            there were absolutely no hints of a Turkish realignment or withdrawal
                            from <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>, in private discussions this
                            was hinted at to the Secretary General by responsible Turkish officials.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LJM_1">Luns</persName> stated that in his view
                            it was ludicrous that Western nations provide such vast resources to
                            third world nations of far less importance to Western security and
                            dramatized his own fears that recent internal difficulties in Turkey,
                            with a growing terrorist threat and near economic collapse, could result
                            in a military takeover with the ultimate loss of Turkey to the West. The
                            Secretary General stated that he would prepare a paper for the North
                            Atlantic Council on this situation and remarked that the key to Turkey’s
                            future clearly rested in American hands.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">The government’s resort to martial law on Monday to
                                quell Turkey’s spiralling political violence was a painful political
                                and ideological step for socialist-minded Prime Minister <persName

                                tough action proves unsuccessful. Whether martial law will restore
                                domestic tranquility will depend as much on the determination of
                                extremists to persist as in the capabilities of Turkey’s no-nonsense

                        <p>The imposition of martial law for the third time since World War II, and
                            the second in this decade, became official December 26 when the Grand
                            National Assembly concurred. <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                >Ecevit</persName> had tried a series of more moderate measures
                            during his first year in office aimed at curbing violence while
                            preserving constitutional liberties, but they failed on both counts.
                            They included a streamlining of the judicial system, improvements in law
                            enforcement methods and personnel including the purging of those
                            associated with extremist groups, and the selective use of military
                            troops to augment the police in outlying provinces. Most recently,
                                <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> banned the youth wing
                            of Alpaslan Turkes’ neo-facist National Action Party, which has
                            spearheaded the violence from the right. That over 600 people were
                            killed during <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>’s first year
                            in office—more than double the rate of deaths in the last year of his
                            predecessor’s reign—attests to this failure. [<hi rend="italic">handling

                            is rooted in politics and ideology. The Prime Minister had strongly
                            criticized earlier martial law periods for their excesses, particularly
                            against members of the left wing of his party who suffered most. In
                            addition, <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> has exhibited a

                            to democracy and against military or other forms of authoritarian rule.
                            Indications are that <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>
                            consented to martial law only after a majority of his cabinet, and
                            possibly the military as well, came out strongly in its favor. [<hi

                        <p>Political violence in Turkey has numerous causes. These include the sharp
                            cleavage between leftist “modernizers” and Islamic traditionalists and
                            nationalists leading to the emergence of rival extremist groups. Their
                            ranks have been augmented with youths radicalized by an outmoded
                            educational system and poor job prospects. In addition to left-right
                            differences and student discontent, the violence has been fueled by
                            sectarian disputes between Sunni and Shiite Muslims and by Kurdish
                            separatist aspirations in the impoverished eastern provinces where
                            economic discontent obviously also plays a role. Whereas the violence in
                            the large urban areas has been directed by one extremist faction against
                            another and has taken the form of “gang warfare,” that in the east has
                            involved large numbers of people, in part because law enforcement is
                            less efficient and the people are more malleable. [<hi rend="italic"

                        <p>The more conservative opposition parties have charged <persName

                            and there is little doubt that his government has been more vigorous in

                            most recent pattern in the eastern provinces, however, has been one in
                            which extreme rightists—possibly associated with <persName

                            more conservative Sunni Muslims to attack members of the poorer Shiite

                                >Ecevit</persName>’s party or other leftist groups. [<hi

                                >Ecevit</persName> government, and in the longer term, for Turkish
                            democracy, will depend on how effective martial law is in curbing
                            domestic strife. Should the Turkish military secure peace, if only a
                            temporary one, <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> will have
                            bought time—time to attend to the underlying causes of violence and to
                            related problems <pb n="396" facs="0429" xml:id="pg_396"/>such as
                            Turkey’s failing economy, which is experiencing inflation and
                            unemployment rates of over 50 percent and 20 percent respectively as
                            well as severe foreign exchange shortages. The military authorities will
                            be aided by the fact that extremist leaders, including <persName
                                corresp="#p_TA_1">Turkes</persName>, have been reluctant openly to
                            incite their followers to storm the barricades. Indeed, <persName
                                corresp="#p_TA_1">Turkes</persName> has even denied any link with
                            extreme rightist gangs. Nonetheless, the need to share power with
                            military authorities in the 13 affected provinces could create strains
                            in the government’s razor thin parliamentary majority of two seats. [<hi

                        <p>Should extremist factions persistently challenge the martial law regime,
                                <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>’s prospects may
                            quickly deteriorate. He will be subjected to conflicting pressures from
                            within his government, his party, and the military, and may ultimately
                            face the dilemma either of backtracking or adopting even more repressive
                            measures. In such circumstances, his government would be in jeopardy,
                            and it is difficult to know what might follow it. There are serious
                            obstacles to most of the alternatives that have been suggested, such as
                            a grand coalition, a government of “technicians”, or a more active role
                            for the President. And should none of these materialize, the military
                            might rapidly lose its reluctance to try again the unhappy experiment in
                            direct rule that it tried in 1971.<note n="2" xml:id="d126fn2">The

                            of the meeting was devoted to a review of the short-term Turkish
                            economic problem. There was agreement on several basic principles: that
                            the <gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss> should be kept in the picture
                            because its participation is essential to attract full participation by
                            the private banking community; that in working out arrangements for
                            immediate help the Germans should be persuaded to take the lead and the
                                <gloss target="#t_EEC_1">EEC</gloss> as a whole should also play a

                                for a meeting of the leaders of the United States, France, the
                                United Kingdom, and West Germany January 5–6, 1979. They agreed that
                                each country would contribute to an economic stabilization program
                                for Turkey.</note> After discussion of the scope of short-term
                            Turkish needs, in which Under Secretary Solomon took the lead, it was
                            agreed that we should run the risk of overestimating, rather than
                            underestimating, the gap between requirements and available resources:
                            $1.8 billion was estimated as the total gap with up to $500 million
                            required in new money to be provided by some form of consortium. In
                            addition to European and American participation, possibilities for
                            Saudi, Kuwaiti and Gulf involvement will be explored both for financial
                            reasons and to underscore the relationship of Turkey to the Middle
                            Eastern situation as a whole. The Chairman directed that a Presidential
                            letter to Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_SH_3">Schmidt</persName>, a
                            position paper for the Guadeloupe Summit and necessary background data
                            be completed by 29 December.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">The longer-term economic problem:</hi> Assistant
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CRN_1">Cooper</persName> noted that the
                            longer-term prospects for Turkish economic growth are good but what
                            happens depends on solutions to the current crisis and basic structural
                            reforms. The Chairman directed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRN_1"
                                >Cooper</persName> to chair a Working Group to assess the
                            longer-term and propose tactics for approaching it. The question of
                            Congressional attitudes, should it become necessary to seek a
                            supplemental appropriation for aid for Turkey, was discussed. The
                            Chairman directed the State Department Counselor to assess this
                            question.</p>

                            Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> said that he
                            thought it was important to recognize that the economic situation in
                            Turkey was showing signs of developing into a political crisis. In spite
                            of its inadequacies, he said, the <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                >Ecevit</persName> Government was the best we could hope for in
                            Turkey in the foreseeable future and its collapse could bring a period
                            of political confusion which might culminate in military intervention.
                            This would have an unsettling effect on the whole region. It was
                            important, he said, to avoid segmentizing economic and political issues
                            too much. He suggested the <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1"
                                >Christopher</persName> visit be taken as an opportunity to lay the
                            groundwork for other measures to bring the Turks into a closer
                            relationship which would undo <pb n="399" facs="0432" xml:id="pg_399"
                            />some of the damage of the Cyprus/Arms Embargo period. The Chairman
                            agreed and directed the Department of State to develop a scope paper for
                            the visit which would reflect these concerns. The Chairman went on to
                            say that he felt more concrete plans for expansion of public diplomacy
                            and exchange programs, military cooperation, scientific and technical
                            cooperation and mechanisms for regular consultation on issues of common
                            concern should be developed. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1"
                                >Brzezinski</persName> proposed that increased intelligence
                            cooperation be added to this list. The Chairman agreed.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Intelligence Assessment:</hi> Before the meeting
                            concluded, the Chairman asked the Director of Central Intelligence to
                            summarize the current conclusions of the intelligence community with
                            special reference to recent civil disturbances and the likely
                            effectiveness of martial law. The <gloss target="#t_DCI_1">DCI</gloss>
                            commented that having to impose martial law was a setback for <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> but what political consequences
                            it would have depended upon how rapidly the military were able to
                            reimpose order. If the military have to resort to large-scale use of
                            force, trouble could be expected from the left wing of <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>’s party and this could lead to a
                            situation where some people thought <persName corresp="#p_EN_1"
                                >Erbakan</persName>’s party could become necessary to <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> to maintain a coalition. The
                                <gloss target="#t_DCI_1">DCI</gloss> said that the intelligence
                            community saw no inclination on the part of the military to assume power
                            themselves.</p>

                                limited further his ability and probably his willingness to risk the

                                Turkey’s domestic and foreign policy problems are not encouraging.

                        <p>I deeply appreciate the importance you attach to revitalizing and
                            widening the relationship and co-operation between our two friendly
                            countries and the personal interest that you have taken in the efforts

                        <p>It is re-assuring to hear from you, Mr. President, that the prospect of
                            Broad Multilateral Co-operation to help alleviate our urgent economic
                            problems were taken up during your recent meeting, with Chancellor

                        <p>I had an extensive and useful conversation with Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName>, covering the major issues
                            that concern both our countries, including the necessity of increasing
                            Military Assistance and I discussed with him the nature and dimensions
                            of our economic problems as well as the policies we are following to
                            deal with them. I also explained to him our relationship with the
                            I.M.F., particularly stressing the necessity of taking into
                            consideration the economic, social and political implications of certain
                            measures that are recommended to us.</p>
                        <p>As I am sure you well know, Mr. President, Turkey has been passing
                            through a critical period of her history and we attach utmost importance
                            to surmounting the crisis of this period without any damage to our
                            Democracy. This is important, not only because of the Turkish people’s
                            strong and proven attachment to the democratic way <pb n="402"
                                facs="0435" xml:id="pg_402"/>of life and to human rights and
                            freedom, but also because Democracy is the basic bond between Turkey and
                            our allies and friends in the West.</p>
                        <p>I am relieved to observe that recently there has been an increasing
                            awareness among our friends and allies of the urgency of Turkey’s
                            economic problems and your personal interest, Mr. President, encourages
                            me to be hopeful that this awareness may soon be translated into action
                            in dimensions commensurate with our urgent requirements.</p>
                        <p>Allow me to take this opportunity to wish you continued success in your
                            efforts for a stable world peace.</p>

                        <p>It was agreed that German leadership in organizing multilateral economic

                            aid ourselves. He stressed the need for action as soon as possible but
                            also underscored the fact that economic support for Turkey will have to

                        <p>Discussion of possible additional amounts and kinds of assistance led the

                        <p>The Director of <gloss target="#t_OMB_1">OMB</gloss> expressed a series
                            of cautions about shortness of funds and Congressional attitudes as well
                            as possible implications of other Middle East requirements. The Deputy
                            Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs stressed the
                            urgency of the problem and the need of the Executive Branch to assess
                            needs in terms of realistic appraisal of where the <gloss

                            necessary to work with Congressional leadership to develop the kind of
                            approach that would best serve our national interests. The Chairman
                            directed that the Working Group reflect <gloss target="#t_OMB_1"
                                >OMB</gloss> concerns but declared that the Turkey problem was too
                            pressing to be put off until an assessment of larger needs in the Middle
                            East could be made. (C)</p>
                        <p>The group recognized the desirability of providing <gloss

                                    >Ecevit</persName>. The first, a March 26 reading item, noted
                                that <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> asked <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SRL_1">Spiers</persName> to relay to <persName
                                    corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> and <persName
                                    corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> his concerns that “the
                                Israelis and the Palestinians are exploiting the Kurdish problem.”
                                    <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> also predicted
                                that the Kurdish nationalists “would become a radical leftist
                                movement.” <persName corresp="#p_ADL_1">Aaron</persName> marked the
                                item and wrote in the right-hand margin, “What is the true story
                                here?” The second, telegram 2415 from Ankara, March 26, underscored
                                the “depth” of <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>’s
                                concern about the Kurdish problem. <persName corresp="#p_SRL_1"
                                    >Spiers</persName> reported <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                    >Ecevit</persName>’s suspicions of the West’s involvement in
                                Kurdish affairs and noted that historically only the Kurds had posed
                                a threat to the integrity of the Turkish Republic. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SRL_1">Spiers</persName> surmised that <persName
                                    corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>’s concerns were triggered by
                                events in Iran where the possibility of Kurdish autonomy was
                                growing. The Ambassador also sought guidance on how to respond to
                                    <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>’s request that
                                Washington influence other Western capitals not to exploit the issue
                                of Kurdish nationalism. At the top of the telegram, <persName
                                    corresp="#p_ADL_1">Aaron</persName> wrote to <persName
                                    corresp="#p_HPB_1">Henze</persName>, “Paul—please follow up.
                                Very important.”</note> I have no doubt that <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>’s worries are genuine. They have
                            been growing ever since Iran fell into crisis. They will have been given
                            impetus by the recent outbreak of Kurdish separatism in Iran. (S)</p>
                        <p>The Soviets have always found the temptation to dabble in Kurdish
                            separatism irresistible in the past; we have succumbed to it ourselves
                            on a couple of occasions. I have called Zbig’s attention to this issue
                            in two recent memoranda (attached at TAB B if you want to re<pb n="409"

                                    corresp="#p_HPB_1">Henze</persName> relayed reports from the
                                Embassy in Tehran on the widening activities of Kurdish autonomists
                                in Azerbaijan. <persName corresp="#p_HPB_1">Henze</persName>
                                recommended that the issue of Kurdish autonomy “should be taken up
                                in a broader context” and registered his concern that the <gloss
                                    target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> and others in the intelligence
                                community were insufficiently attentive to this issue.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> has reason to be alarmed
                            if the Soviets decide to make a major investment in Kurds now, using
                            them as they have exploited Palestinians to destabilize the whole area.
                            The Turks have the most to lose because they have both the largest
                            Kurdish population and one which is best integrated into their own state
                            and society. In face of other strains Turkey is experiencing, alienation
                            of her Kurds could have a devastating effect on her stability and on her
                            military strength over the next few years. (S)</p>
                        <p>What do we do?</p>
                        <p>• Build up basic Turkish strength (as we are moving to do) to give the
                            Turks the confidence to maintain their strong governmental system which
                            has been more effective in constraining Kurdish nationalism than either
                            the Iraqis or the Iranians have been.</p>
                        <p>• Use whatever influence we can develop (we seem to have almost none at
                            present) to see that Iranian Kurds are contained.</p>
                        <p>• Learn more about what is happening among Kurds so that we are operating
                            on the basis of knowledge, not hearsay or fears. We mounted effective
                            intelligence operations 1–2 years ago to find out what was going on
                            among Eritreans. The Kurdish problem is far more important from the
                            viewpoint of our strategic interests than the Eritrean one. We should be
                            able to learn as much about it.<note n="4" xml:id="d132fn4">In the

                                paragraph.</note> (S)</p>
                        <p>Suspicions that we are dabbling with Kurds and that Israelis may be doing
                            so too will probably persist. If we deny them too often we merely
                            reinforce them. We should, however, be in steady dialogue with our
                            Turkish allies on this problem; this should assuage some of the worries
                            we know they have. If we can ever work up the basis for meaningful
                            dialogue with the Iraqis, we should probably also talk to them about
                            Kurds. They have had more experience with Kurdish rebellions than anyone
                            else and should know the dangers of letting the Soviets play around too
                            freely. (C)</p>
                        <p>It could be, however, that the Soviets are doing less than we think. The
                            plain fact is that we don’t know. The Soviet radio broadcasts 10½ hours
                            per week in Kurdish <hi rend="italic">officially</hi>; there are also
                            clandestine broadcasts, I believe. As far as I know, <gloss

                        <p>5. Pursuant to instructions, we have told the Turks that their approach,
                            with its integral 5-year force modernization plan, is outside the realm
                            of the possible. The practical consequences of this position could be
                            failure to reach agreement in our negotiations. The Turkish reaction to
                            our “best efforts” formula for future defense assistance has been
                            frigid. We were told after Ambassador’s talk with <persName

                                into a five-year defense support agreement was “badly received” by
                                the Turkish military. (National Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1"
                                    >RG</gloss> 59, Central Foreign Policy File,
                                D790164–1127)</note> It appears that the Turkish military are not
                            willing to accept what we can offer now: a year-by-year consideration of
                            Turkish military requirements in a context in which they believe our
                            judgment is largely influenced by extraneous political issues.</p>
                        <p>6. The Turkish 5-year “modernization” plan, which we initially priced at
                            between $10 and $15 billion, has been subject to detailed review and
                                <gloss target="#t_JUSMMAT_1">JUSMMAT</gloss> estimates it to be in
                            the $3 to $4 billion range (apparently including O&amp;M costs). From
                            Turkish standpoint, this plan is fairly moderate (omitting such
                            high-cost items as F16’s, for example) and justifiable if Turkey is to
                            continue to make a creditable contribution to <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss> defense. The Turks argue that they are not asking for
                            money, as in the past, but are seeking specific items of military
                            equipment made necessary by their <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                            role. The Turks will certainly hold out for some portion of equipment
                            transfers at reduced cost.</p>
                        <p>7. A further difficulty bearing on our negotiations is the Turkish
                            perception of recent events in this region. Turkey sees the magnitude of
                                <pb n="412" facs="0445" xml:id="pg_412"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> efforts elsewhere. They point to
                            our delivery on an urgent basis from <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> stocks—which we seem to be able to spare—$400 million
                            of equipment to Yemen. They read about the Secretary of Defense
                            travelling to the Middle East talking about large infusions of military
                            assistance. Earlier this week, the papers carried reports of <persName
                                corresp="#p_MDE_1">McGiffert</persName>’s visit to Cairo and the
                            $1.5 billion additional assistance package for Egypt. They see military
                            funds being poured into Israel.</p>
                        <p>8. The Turks see themselves, in contrast, as a <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss> member, located directly on the Soviet border, their
                            armed forces disastrously malequipped and facing block [<hi
                                rend="italic">bleak</hi>?] obsolescence, under levy of additional
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> military and intelligence
                            requirements which will increase their attractiveness as a target for
                            Soviet political and military pressure and destabilization efforts, as
                            well as their isolation in this region as the only country harbouring
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> military installations. While
                            the decision to seek a $50 million grant program has had a positive
                            impact on the spirits of pro-<gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                            elements, the general reaction in military circles is that our overall
                            response is minimal and ad hoc as measured by their needs.</p>
                        <p>9. It is possible that the net sum of these perceptions will be that the
                            game is not worth the candle. Perhaps those who say that Turkey has no
                            alternative to its defense ties with the West may be right. On the other
                            hand, they may also be wrong. There are significant groups here who feel
                            Turkey’s best interests would be served if the country opted out of
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>. Also, there are other
                            Turkish policy options, far less drastic, which would simply remove
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> forces but maintain <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> membership (the Norwegian model is
                            much in <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>’s mind—as is the
                            French). Many view the acceptance of <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> military and economic aid as giving us license to push
                            them in directions contrary to their national interests on Cyprus, Greek
                            reintegration, etc. We may find that we are placing more weight on an
                            essentially ambivalent Turkish political situation than it can bear, and
                            that we will tip it in an unfavorable direction.</p>
                        <p>10. If <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Warren Christopher</persName> comes
                            here, I think he should make the defense agreement—its framework, not
                            its details—a major topic for candid exploration. This should be
                            preceded by a review at the highest level before we conclusively reject
                            the Turkish approach in the defense negotiations.</p>
                        <p>11. It may also be time to give some serious consideration to even higher
                            level visits. In defense terms, a full and frank discussion with the
                            Turkish military establishment of its problems and plans, in our view,
                            warrants a personal visit by <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Harold

                            direction. They are confused and uneasy. Its proponents had hoped that a
                            5-year defense agreement would give a new stability to the relationship.
                            The best we have been able to say is that we want a one-year renewable
                            option. Perhaps we could make a small move in the Turkish direction as a
                            next step, by including a revision of Article 3 of the foundation

                        <p>2. Dear Mr. Prime Minister: I am writing to you on a matter of major
                            importance not only for the United States, but for the peace and
                            security of the world. I hope shortly to conclude the <gloss
                                target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> Two treaty with the Soviet Union.
                            Knowing your deep commitment to nuclear arms control and your
                            understanding of the central role which <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                                >SALT</gloss> plays in our common effort to improve East-West
                            relations, I want to raise with you personally an essential contribution
                            Turkey can make to the Treaty’s success.</p>
                        <p>I know you recognize the crucial importance of verification with respect
                            to the whole <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> process and the new
                            Treaty in particular. To help ensure that we do not miss an historic
                            opportunity to move the world in the direction we both desire, I am
                            requesting your cooperation in efforts to establish a verification
                            system consonant with the Treaty and central to its realization.</p>
                        <p>We are taking several steps to improve our verification systems over the
                            longer term—particularly with satellites. To cover the interim period we
                            must take other measures. In this connection, we propose to install
                            monitoring equipment on high-altitude aircraft which could collect
                            enough signals from Soviet ICBMs during flight-testing so as to provide
                            for the verification of <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>
                            constraints on these missiles.</p>
                        <p>To do so, the aircraft would have to fly at high altitudes over Turkish
                            airspace. These aircraft would not overfly the Soviet Union, and would
                            not be based in Turkey. At certain times of the year when there is a
                            significant chance of a Soviet test on any given day, daily flights
                            might be required to ensure that most of the <gloss target="#t_ICBM_1"
                                >ICBM</gloss> flight-tests <pb n="415" facs="0448" xml:id="pg_415"
                            />are monitored. The aircraft could be ready within perhaps 6–9 months.
                            We would of course work closely with you in planning and implementing
                            all phases of this program.</p>
                        <p>I can assure you that what I am proposing is fully consistent with the
                            provisions of the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> Treaty. The use
                            of national technical means of verification is explicitly provided for
                            in the Treaty, as is a ban on interference with these means. Further,
                            there is recognition of the propriety of collecting telemetered <gloss
                                target="#t_ICBM_1">ICBM</gloss> signals whenever this telemetry is
                            used for verification. The flights I am proposing are also consistent
                            with the Soviet practice of collecting information about flight-testing
                            of US ICBMs. While I fully appreciate Turkey’s historical sensitivities
                            about overflights of adjacent nations by intelligence collection
                            aircraft based in Turkey, I believe you will agree with me that what I
                            am now proposing is fundamentally different from the activities of the
                            past.</p>
                        <p>In view of your own strong support for the Treaty and the clear
                            legitimacy of the program itself, I hope that after studying my proposal
                            you will agree that we can proceed to institute this limited overflight
                            system at the earliest possible time.</p>
                        <p>Should you have any questions about my proposal, please ask Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_SRL_1">Spiers</persName> and we shall provide
                            a full and prompt response. I look forward to hearing from you at an
                            early time so that together we can proceed to ensure the verifiability
                            of a new <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> Two treaty. Sincerely,

                                follows: “What [<persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>] says,
                                in essence, is that Turkey is agreeable to them [overflights] if we
                                and the Soviets together agree that they are okay and, presumably,
                                if we guarantee Turkey against any retribution from the Soviets for
                                cooperating.” <persName corresp="#p_HPB_1">Henze</persName> also
                                noted that the situation could effectively subordinate Turkish
                                sovereignty, and he wondered if there was a precedent for this with
                                regard to <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>, and, moreover, if

                                for overflights was politically tenable in Turkey. (Ibid.)</note>

                            II. It was due to our awareness of the importance of verification that
                            we did not hesitate to expedite the resumption of activity in the
                            installations in Turkey, soon after the lifting of the embargo, without
                            waiting for the signing of new defence and economic co-operation

                        <p>We were faced with considerable reaction from the Soviet Union, however,
                            as they tended to interpret our decision as incompatible with good
                            neighbourly relations.</p>
                        <p>In anticipation of such a reaction, I had suggested to Secretary of State

                        </p>
                        <p>I am sure you would appreciate, Mr. President, that Turkey, being
                            situated in a most sensitive part of the world and faced with immense
                                <pb n="417" facs="0450" xml:id="pg_417"/>problems, would not wish to
                            risk her own security and endanger her own relations with the Soviet
                            Union and other neighbouring countries, while trying to contribute to
                            improved East-West relations and to world peace.</p>
                        <p>It would, therefore, greatly ease our position if Turkey’s role in the
                            efforts for the successful implementation of <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                                >SALT</gloss> II were to be acceptable to both parties in the
                            agreement, or the contributions that could be expected from certain
                            third countries were to be clearly defined.</p>
                        <p>Yet, even after the information we have received from Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_SRL_1">Spiers</persName>, we are left somewhat
                            in the dark as regards the arrangements on which you might have agreed
                            with the Soviet Union on verification, particularly in respect to the
                            possible role of third countries.</p>
                        <p>It is very important for us to be clear on this point before being
                            committed to new forms of contribution, especially to allowing
                            overflights for intelligence purposes, in view of the sensitivity not
                            only of the neighbouring countries, but also of our own public
                            opinion.</p>
                        <p>Although we have been assured through your Ambassador that the United
                            States does not need “Soviet approval of or acquiescence in” its
                            verification activities, I am sure you would agree that it would not be
                            equally justifiable or safe for a country in Turkey’s position to forego
                            seeking such acquiescence.</p>
                        <p>The modernization of the already existing installations in Turkey for
                            improved verification can be considered separately. Since this may be
                            interpreted and explained within the framework of our existing
                            co-operation. But any new arrangement should be initiated in a way that
                            would not create new problems either for Turkey or for our region and
                            for the East-West relations in general.</p>
                        <p>In view of these considerations, I agree, as has been suggested by the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Ambassador in Ankara, that the
                            matter be studied in greater detail and alternative possibilities of
                            Turkey’s extended co-operation be reviewed between our officials, and
                            during the expected visit to Turkey of Deputy Secretary of State Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Warren Christopher</persName>.</p>
                        <p>I assure you, Mr. President, that we would do all we can to try and find
                            the means of further extending our co-operation for world peace provided
                            that Turkey’s position or regional detente is not thereby
                            endangered.</p>
                        <p>With highest regards, I remain, Mr. President.</p>

                            the proposed $248 million to this year’s emergency aid pool as the
                                <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> will match. (C)</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, Turkey has taken some significant economic rationalization
                            measures and agreed to resume negotiations next week with the <gloss

                            These negotiations are likely to take two to three months. The Turks now
                            realize that they will not get emergency economic aid until they adopt a

                        <p>2. Prior to plenary meeting evening May 7 Deputy Secretary <persName

                            following oral message to him from President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>:</p>
                        <p>“I am very much aware of the difficulties Turkey is now experiencing. We
                            want to be helpful to you in dealing with these problems. We attach
                            enormous importance to the Turkish-American relationship and see it as
                            having both long-term and fundamental importance in the entire
                            political, economic and security system we support.</p>
                        <p>“Turkey is a country dedicated to democracy, to broadly based economic
                            development, and to social justice. It has already made great strides
                            toward creating a full and modern life for its people. We want to see
                            Turkey continue to serve as an example for the developing world to
                            emulate. This was <persName corresp="#p_AMK_2">Ataturk</persName>’s
                            vision and one which you have brought closer to realization.</p>
                        <p>“Turkish participation in <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> and its
                            involvement in other European-American common undertakings is a vital
                            element in our own political and security calculations. We are eager,
                            too, to see Turkey develop its role as a link between Europe and the
                            Eastern Mediterranean and Middle East. We welcome and value your help
                            and advice in dealing with problems in these areas.</p>
                        <p>“I admire the political courage you have displayed in making difficult
                            economic and internal security decisions during the past few months. And
                            I sympathize with you in dealing with the political strains these
                            courageous decisions have caused.</p>
                        <p>“I am heartened that progress is being made in working out an economic
                            stabilization program that will enable you to reach agreement with the
                            International Monetary Fund. I look forward to working closely with you
                            to help Turkey return to a condition of economic good health so that
                            your country can build on the economic base that has been developed in
                            the past two decades. I foresee increasing opportu<pb n="421"

                            countries, and I assure you we will pursue them vigorously.</p>
                        <p>“<persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Warren Christopher</persName> will talk to
                            you frankly about my concerns relating to <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                                >SALT</gloss> and the verification problem, which is very important
                            to us and, I believe, to you too. I hope he can work out with you a
                            basis for understanding and cooperation which will serve both our
                            interests.”</p>

                        <p>1. Deputy Secretary opened May 8 afternoon meeting with Turkish Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> by indicating
                            there were two reasons why he had decided to remain in Ankara for an
                            additional meeting with the Prime Minister—</p>
                        <p>A) He was not sure he had adequately conveyed the time pressures we were
                            under. We were close to an announcement of an agreement in principle on
                                <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II. If we were to follow the
                            approach suggested by <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> May
                            7, viz to seek Soviet acquiescence,<note n="2" xml:id="d138fn2">Telegram

                            within the relatively small window between the announcement of agreement
                            in principle and the summit meeting at which the Treaty would be
                            signed:</p>
                        <p>B) The Deputy Secretary said there also was a more substantive factor. If
                            the US and Turkey were unable to reach agreement on a point of great
                            importance related to the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> process
                            which in turn was important to President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                >Carter</persName> and the Congress, this could have an adverse
                            effect on the tone of our relationship for some time to come in the
                            future. Speaking as a friend of Turkey, <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1"
                                >Christopher</persName> said he would like to avoid such shock waves
                            and see if the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and Turkey could not
                            come closer on the overflight issue.</p>
                        <p>2. The Deputy Secretary said he had tried to develop an approach that
                            took into account the <gloss target="#t_PriMin_1">PriMin</gloss>’s
                            letter to the President,<note n="3" xml:id="d138fn3">See <ref

                            on May 7 and our concern not to give the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                                >USSR</gloss> veto power over what allies of the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> did on their own territory. In regard
                            to latter concern, we took into account fact that the UK and <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> already played a verification role.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> said he had
                            tried to meet Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                >Ecevit</persName>’s thought of not putting Turkey in jeopardy
                            because of its geography, other relationships, and current problems. He
                            had a draft for the Prime Minister’s consideration which had not been
                            seen by the President or other senior <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> officers.</p>
                        <p>3. Before looking at the draft, Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> responded strongly indicating
                            that it was “unfortunate and disheartening” to have a new stumbling
                            block introduced into our relations. “Turkey does not deserve such
                            treatment.” It has been a trusting and trustworthy ally. Turkey showed
                            this in reactivating the facilities without a new agreement or knowing
                            what level of aid would be forthcoming. When the President and <persName
                                corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> broached the subject of
                            overflights, <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> said the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> did not even think of using
                            this as a bargaining point to secure additional aid. If Turkish
                            cooperation with the Western world is beset at every point with
                            stumbling blocks, Turkey’s sense of insecurity within the Alliance will
                            only increase.</p>

                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> said it was not
                            his style to engage in bargaining or trades or to make US attitude
                            dependent on what Turkey does. Repeal of the embargo was initiated in
                            this spirit. We were now talking of a bolder, nobler cause and the
                            proposal he was making was not unreasonable. The reference to the effect
                            of a turndown in US-Turkey relations was not a threat, only a comment
                            reflecting realities. He was not attempting to coerce. He was confident
                            the <gloss target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> would do what was right.</p>

                        <p>1). The United States intends, subject to the approval of the Government
                            of Turkey, to use overflights of the territory of Turkey as one of the

                            both sides, the United States expects that the Soviet Union will not
                            interfere with or object to these overflights. Should there be any such
                            interference or objection, it would have adverse repercussions with
                            respect to ratification of <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II and
                            its subsequent implementation.</p>
                        <p>3). The United States has been informed by the Government of Turkey that
                            it shares the belief of the United States and the Soviet Union that the

                            to improved East-West relations and to world peace. It is therefore

                            reaction was favorable. There was a problem with the last sentence which
                            implied an agreement on the part of Turkey, and he proposed modification
                            to delete this (revised text below). He could, however, undertake no
                            commitment until he consulted the Council of Ministers, the National

                        <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> said that even before
                                <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName>’s remarks
                            implying linkage he had had the impression that we were dragging our
                            feet on economic credits, bilateral aid, and on the new defense
                            agreement. If this impression is confirmed, he will have to conclude
                            that it is linked to a new element. That would tend to open an
                            “incurable wound” with the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and the
                            West. Turkey’s already existing sense of insecurity in the Alliance
                            would be further increased. <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                >Ecevit</persName> repeated that he had not thought to exploit the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> requests for overflights either
                            bilaterally on defense aid issues or with <gloss target="#t_OECD_1"
                                >OECD</gloss> countries. This proposal goes beyond Alliance/defense
                            relations to questions of world peace and the prevention of nuclear war
                            and thus he did not think of using it as a bargaining, chip for asking
                            for additional aid. If, however, the Turks perceived linkage in the mind
                            of an ally, they would have to rethink their whole position if the
                            government, the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>, or public opinion
                            gets the impression that bilateral and/or <gloss target="#t_OECD_1"
                                >OECD</gloss> aid is being delayed because of this element then
                            there would be a reaction relating to all Turkey’s cooperation,
                            including this aspect and it could cause deep disappointment on the part
                            of all.</p>
                        <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> said this
                            discussion demonstrates that in our effort to improve our relationship
                            and cooperate together we must be sensitive to each other and the way
                            things are understood in the other country. We are concerned not to jar
                            the relationship and will continue to be sensitive. The <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> course will be constructive in
                            character. We are determined to press our effort to help Turkey as fast
                            as possible. <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> said he
                            was returning to Washington with several high agenda items.</p>
                        <p>a) We want to get congressional approval of the full economic assistance

                        <p>1. The President and the Secretary of State have approved the approach to
                            the Soviets and the oral note on overflights which was agreed to ad
                            referendum between Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"

                                >See <ref target="#d138">Document 138</ref>.</note> You should
                            contact <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> and tell him that
                            we would like to take the <pb n="426" facs="0459" xml:id="pg_426"
                            />matter up with the Soviets as soon as he is able to confirm his
                            tentative approval of the approach.</p>
                        <p>2. It is highly desirable that the Secretary be able to present the oral
                            note and discuss this matter with <persName corresp="#p_DAF_1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> before the Secretary leaves on May 20 for an
                            extended trip to Europe and the Middle East. The Secretary will not
                            return to Washington until approximately June 3 and it could be very
                            difficult for him to take the matter up with <persName

                            concurrence to enable us to discuss the matter with <persName

                            the week of May 13–19. I realize that <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                >Ecevit</persName> indicated that he wanted to await <persName

                            that he can consult <persName corresp="#p_OG_1">Okcun</persName> by
                            cable if necessary. Please report on Monday, May 14 what the prospects

                                The article reprinted a statement released the previous day by the
                                Turkish Foreign Ministry: “In response to the United States request,
                                it has been pointed out that Turkey attaches great importance to

                                implementation. However, since Turkey is not a party to this treaty
                                between the United States and the Soviet Union and as the text is
                                not fully known to its Government, the subject could be taken up in
                                the authoritative Turkish governmental bodies only if it is
                                determined by Turkey that the requested contribution advances the
                                objectives and concurs with the understanding of the parties to the

                            confidence that I met with Senate Majority Leader <persName

                            feasibility of restoring the grant <gloss target="#t_MAP_1">MAP</gloss>
                            on the Senate floor. Senator <persName corresp="#p_BRC_1"
                                >Byrd</persName> asked about “my friend <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                >Ecevit</persName>,” and I gave him a full briefing on my trip,
                            including my perception of the disappointment of the Turkish military
                            leaders at the <gloss target="#t_SFRC_1">SFRC</gloss>’s substitution of

                                >MAP</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_BRC_1">Byrd</persName> said he
                            was willing to help in restoring grant <gloss target="#t_MAP_1"
                                >MAP</gloss> by offering an amendment on the Senate floor if he
                            believes the move can be successful. He has a reputation of prevailing
                            on any matter that he has sponsored on the Senate floor. At his request,
                            we will make soundings in the next day or two and report back to him
                            early next week.</p>
                        <p>4. If you have not done so, you may also wish to report to <persName

                            Turks even talk about a more basic “reform” of the political system
                            itself, which might lead to military involvement. A weak government in

                                >Okcun</persName> in May 31 conversation with Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> focused on <gloss

                            Relationship should be improved through concrete developments in areas
                            such as co-production and quickening of the military pipeline
                            deliveries. <persName corresp="#p_OG_1">Okcun</persName> urged rapid
                            movement on <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>/Turkish base
                            negotiations along the lines of the Turkish scenario for these
                            negotiations. He also stressed the need for <gloss target="#t_US_1"

                            context. <persName corresp="#p_OG_1">Okcun</persName> conveyed to
                            Secretary Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>’s
                            gratitude for <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> efforts on military

                                <persName corresp="#p_OG_1">Okcun</persName> expressed hope for
                            movement in Cyprus intercommunal discussions and said that <persName
                                corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> must give up his idea of a
                            unitary state. On other matters, <persName corresp="#p_OG_1"
                                >Okcun</persName> stressed Turkish concern with events in the
                            Iran/Afghanistan “crescent.” Secretary responded that he would follow-up
                            on bilateral issues <persName corresp="#p_OG_1">Okcun</persName> had
                            raised. He described our policy vis-a-vis Iran and the <gloss

                        <p>3. Present for bilateral on <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> side
                            were Counselor <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName>, Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_BWT_1">Bennett</persName>, Assistant Secretary

                            Turkish participants were Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SF_1"
                                >Sahinbas</persName>, who is responsible for <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss>/Turkish base negotiations and Ali Hikmet Alp of <gloss

                        <p>4. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> told <persName
                                corresp="#p_OG_1">Okcun</persName> that he had enjoyed latter’s
                            interventions during <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> Ministerial
                            even though he didn’t agree with all of them. He asked what subjects
                                <persName corresp="#p_OG_1">Okcun</persName> wanted to take up.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_OG_1">Okcun</persName> said that U.S./Turkish
                            bilateral relations were of great importance. When <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> government came to office in
                            early 1978 it had stressed this point and had hoped for more progress
                            than had actually been achieved. Turkey now looks forward to concrete
                            results and projects in order to sell U.S./Turkish cooperation to the
                            Turkish public. <pb n="430" facs="0463" xml:id="pg_430"/>Relationship
                            could thus be improved on a lasting basis of benefit to both countries
                            and the region. Secretary said he shared these objectives and asked what
                            can be done. He said he had the impression that a number of things were
                            underway such as co-production.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_OG_1">Okcun</persName> said that a <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> co-production team was in fact in
                            Ankara this week and that something should start in this area. Another
                            area of great interest to the military was facilitating the flow of
                            military material through the pipeline to Turkey. He added that specific
                            examples of U.S./Turkish cooperation, such as a plant or a co-production
                            project could be used to create a good public image.</p>
                        <p>7. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> said he was
                            very much in favor of this and was willing to take a look at any
                            concrete suggestions made by the Turks as well as coming up with our own
                            ideas. He asked <persName corresp="#p_OG_1">Okcun</persName> to let him
                            know personally if there was any delay in the delivery of military
                            equipment.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_OG_1">Okcun</persName> said as an example that
                            over the last 15 months, construction of a plant should have started. He
                            noted that Counselor <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> had
                            come to Ankara in February of last year and nothing had occurred in the
                            area of economic cooperation since then. (Secretary and <persName
                                corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> objected to this sweeping
                            statement.) <persName corresp="#p_OG_1">Okcun</persName> argued again
                            that Turkey wants a concrete, politically justifiable and feasible
                            relationship with the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> which over
                            the long term would be of interest to both countries as well as
                            democracy and the free world. Secretary said he agreed and <persName
                                corresp="#p_OG_1">Okcun</persName> said it was necessary to work out
                            the details.</p>
                        <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_OG_1">Okcun</persName> then moved to the status
                            of U.S./Turkey base negotiations and asked Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_SF_1">Sahinbas</persName> to describe the current
                            situation. <persName corresp="#p_SF_1">Sahinbas</persName> outlined the
                            Turkish concept of a defense cooperation “umbrella” agreement with four
                            supplemental agreements. He described the meetings with Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_SRL_1">Spiers</persName> and on the working
                            group level. The previous 1969 <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> had
                            been based on Article 3 of the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                            Charter; current Turkish drafts were based on both Articles 2 and
                                3.<note n="2" xml:id="d141fn2">Article 2 of the <gloss
                                    target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> Charter reads: “The Parties will
                                contribute toward the further development of peaceful and friendly
                                international relations by strengthening their free institutions, by
                                bringing about a better understanding of the principles upon which
                                these institutions are founded, and by promoting conditions of
                                stability and well-being. They will seek to eliminate conflict in
                                their international economic policies and will encourage economic
                                collaboration between any or all of them.” Article 3 of the <gloss
                                    target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> Charter reads: “In order more
                                effectively to achieve the objectives of the Treaty, the Parties,

                                self-help and mutual aid, will maintain and develop their individual
                                and collective capacity to resist armed attack.”</note>
                            Demonstrating the link between economic and defense matters, <persName
                                corresp="#p_SF_1">Sahinbas</persName> said that all their drafts had
                            been given to the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Embassy which had
                            passed them to Washington. Turkey was now waiting for Washington
                            comments and instructions to its Embassy.</p>
                        <pb n="431" facs="0464" xml:id="pg_431"/>
                        <p>10. Secretary asked when these agreements had been received in
                            Washington. Counselor <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> said
                            that we had had them for about three weeks. Secretary promised to give
                            impetus to this process. <persName corresp="#p_OG_1">Okcun</persName>
                            said that this was very important in view of the expiration in October
                            of this year of the deadline for completing the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1"
                                >DCA</gloss>. He said <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> may have
                            some difficulties with Turkish recommendations but it would be better to
                            follow Turkish patterns, i.e. the “umbrella” concept with supplemental
                            agreements. <persName corresp="#p_OG_1">Okcun</persName> thought that
                            such an agreement could pass both Turkish Parliament and <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Congress.</p>
                        <p>11. <persName corresp="#p_OG_1">Okcun</persName> continued that Turkish
                            concept of the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> was a matter of
                            substance, not just form. Secretary asked him to elaborate. <persName
                                corresp="#p_OG_1">Okcun</persName> said that Turkey sees its
                            military relationship with <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> as
                            embodied in the concepts of defense procurement, economic cooperation,
                            co-production and installations. These can be worked out in a practical
                            fashion through the four supplemental agreements under an umbrella
                            agreement and could be presented successfully to the Parliament.
                            Secretary asked that <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> get
                            response to Turkish proposals to him as soon as possible. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> commented that the Turkish
                            proposals represented a serious effort, that we were working hard on
                            them and will do our best to frame our response in a way as close as
                            possible to the form Turkey prefers.</p>
                        <p>12. <persName corresp="#p_OG_1">Okcun</persName> said his third major
                            point in the context of our bilateral relations was the need for <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> support for Turkey with institutions
                            such as the <gloss target="#t_OECD_1">OECD</gloss> and the World Bank as
                            well as other Alliance countries and Japan. <persName corresp="#p_OG_1"
                                >Okcun</persName> noted that Japan had been somewhat “shy” possibly
                            because of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> He added that when he
                            had been in Tokyo Japanese had told him that Turkey and Japan were two
                            great countries which did not need an intermediary.</p>
                        <p>13. Secretary responded that he thought he was doing the Turks a favor by
                            talking to the Japanese, pointing out Japanese had increased their
                            contribution to the <gloss target="#t_OECD_1">OECD</gloss> package.
                                <persName corresp="#p_OG_1">Okcun</persName> said he did not know
                            whether this was due to Secretary’s efforts with Japanese or his own.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> continued with
                            regard to the World Bank, that he had already talked to Bank President
                                <persName corresp="#p_MRS_1">McNamara</persName> and urged latter’s
                            cooperation on the Turkish problem. <persName corresp="#p_MRS_1"
                                >McNamara</persName> had said he would personally pursue the matter.
                            Secretary added that he was prepared to keep in touch with <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRS_1">McNamara</persName> on this issue if Turks
                            wanted; if they did not think it would be helpful he would desist.
                                <persName corresp="#p_OG_1">Okcun</persName> indicated that further
                            such efforts by Secretary would be appreciated.</p>
                        <p>14. <persName corresp="#p_OG_1">Okcun</persName> then shifted discussion
                            to Middle East situation. Said he had recently visited Saudi Arabia and
                            Iran and was very concerned about Middle East “Balkanization,” which was
                            taking place from Afghanistan to Syria. He said that further
                            deterioration would endanger the region and was creating problems for
                            Turkey as well. There were <pb n="432" facs="0465" xml:id="pg_432"/>real
                            dangers in such developments; no Western countries, including Israel,
                            should stimulate “Balkanization” since Soviets would then enter on scene
                            and create separate satellites or small political entities.</p>
                        <p>15. Secretary said his view on Iran had been clear from the outset.
                            Situation in Iran was a domestic matter for Iranians. The <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> would not interfere and cannot accept
                            interference by others. He has adhered to this policy and both he and
                            President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> have been
                            severely criticized as a result. However, the policy is right. There is
                            a true revolution in Iran and outside intervention would only exacerbate
                            the situation. We wish the current government well, have decent friendly
                            relations with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BM_1"
                                >Bazargan</persName> but will not push and will keep a low profile.
                            We will let relations develop as Iranians want. Secretary said he saw
                            real problems for stability of <persName corresp="#p_BM_1"
                                >Bazargan</persName> government because of dual form of government
                            in Iran. <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> will stay out, but this
                            does not lessen our concern.</p>
                        <p>16. <persName corresp="#p_OG_1">Okcun</persName> stressed the need for
                            non-interference in the area at every level including the secret
                            service. Conflict involving the Kurds in Iran is of great concern to
                            Turkey. Turkey makes clear to everybody, including <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, that dismemberment of Iran would
                            have serious political implications for the region as a whole. <persName
                                corresp="#p_OG_1">Okcun</persName> noted that <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> has “arranged” the Chinese side of
                            things, and with <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II European
                            matters are going reasonably well. The most difficult current problem is
                            in the “crescent” from Ethiopia/Somalia to Afghanistan.</p>
                        <p>17. Secretary responded that he has theory that one must deal with facts
                            and problems in each country. Countries such as Iran and Pakistan are
                            not identical and considering them as such risks oversimplification.
                                <persName corresp="#p_OG_1">Okcun</persName> responded he agreed and
                            did not want to oversimplify. However Turkey attached great importance
                            to its economic cooperation in the region and felt that this would
                            contribute to regional stability. Secretary said there was no doubt of
                            this and that all of us see Turkey as a great factor for stability.
                            There is no difference in the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> on
                            this.</p>
                        <p>18. <persName corresp="#p_OG_1">Okcun</persName> asked if Israel was
                            “cooking up” something in Iran. Secretary responded that there was no
                            question of this. Initially there had been real concern about the Jewish
                            population in Iran. Fear of a purge had caused tremors both in Israel
                            and the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>, however, both <persName
                                corresp="#p_KR_1">Ayatollah Khomeini</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_BM_1">Bazargan</persName> had spoken out against such a
                            purge as against Islamic tenets. There was nothing to the report of
                            Israeli meddling in Iran.</p>
                        <p>19. <persName corresp="#p_OG_1">Okcun</persName> then asked how <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> intended to repair its image with the
                            Arabs. Secretary noted that Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia would probably
                            be coming to the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> by the end of
                            summer or early fall, King <persName corresp="#p_HBT_1"
                                >Hussein</persName> about the same time and King <persName
                                corresp="#p_H2_1">Hassan</persName> of Morocco had visited already.
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> has sent emissaries to the Gulf
                            states. However, the real <pb n="433" facs="0466" xml:id="pg_433"
                            />indicator will be progress in the negotiations, particularly on the
                            Palestinian issue.</p>
                        <p>20. <persName corresp="#p_OG_1">Okcun</persName> asked if the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> should get in touch with the <gloss
                                target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss>. Secretary described in some detail
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> efforts to make openings toward
                            the <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> based on different
                            interpretations of <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Resolution 242 and
                            the possibility of the <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> dealing with
                            the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> through West Bank Palestinians.
                            Secretary said that <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Arafat</persName> is
                            aware of his efforts, has not responded as yet, although they were close
                            at one point.</p>
                        <p>21. Secretary said that Turkey seems to think it was necessary to
                            re-write 242 but he thought this would be immensely complicated. We have
                            made progress and now even Israel has agreed that the Palestinian issue
                            cannot be swept under the rug. Thus the concerns of <persName
                                corresp="#p_AY_1">Arafat</persName> have been met to a large extent.
                                <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Arafat</persName> has indicated he
                            doesn’t want to play his trump card. Secretary said his view is that it
                            is time to stop playing games and make some progress.</p>
                        <p>22. <persName corresp="#p_OG_1">Okcun</persName> said that Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> had asked him to
                            express his satisfaction to Secretary about <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> efforts with the Congress on Turkish military
                            assistance and the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> efforts in the
                                <gloss target="#t_OECD_1">OECD</gloss> context. This shows that the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> has stopped following the
                            policy of linkage. Secretary asked <persName corresp="#p_OG_1"
                                >Okcun</persName> to please pass his respects to Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>. <persName
                                corresp="#p_OG_1">Okcun</persName> said that <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> has a good friend in Turkey. Secretary responded that
                            he hoped the Turks felt the same way about the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_OG_1">Okcun</persName> said that the Secretary
                            should have no doubts about this.</p>
                        <p>23. Secretary promised follow-up on matters that <persName
                                corresp="#p_OG_1">Okcun</persName> had raised. Latter concluded
                            conversation with comment on Cyprus to effect that he hoped that June 15
                            intercommunal talks will start as scheduled. He said it was necessary to
                            convince <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> to abandon the
                            idea of a Cypriot unitary state. <persName corresp="#p_DR_1"
                                >Denktash</persName>, according to <persName corresp="#p_OG_1"
                                >Okcun</persName>, believes that <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName> has not abandoned this concept. Secretary said
                            he would have to study the ten points.<note n="3" xml:id="d141fn3">See

                        </p>
                        <p>1. Secret-entire text.</p>
                        <p>2. Summary: We do not think intervention by the Turkish military in the
                            Turks political process is imminent before the October elections. The
                            military is dissatisfied with the trend of events, however, and should
                            the political/economic situation deteriorate further they might decide
                            to intervene for a third time. End summary.</p>
                        <p>3. Because the Turks military regards itself as the ultimate defender of
                                <persName corresp="#p_AMK_2">Ataturk</persName>’s Westernizing and
                            modernizing reforms and has intervened in the political process twice
                            since 1960, a third intervention has to be regarded as possible. The
                            failure of Turkey’s politicians to find solutions to deep-seated
                            economic and social problems and continuation of cutthroat politics as
                            usual during the first half of 1979 has created dissatisfaction among
                            senior military officers. Centrifugal forces at work in neighboring
                            Iran, renewal of Kurdish activity in Iraq and internal expressions of
                            Kurdish nationalist sentiment in Turkey’s sensitive southeastern
                            provinces have heightened their concern. As a result, there is evidence
                            that senior military officers have discussed the possibility of a third
                            political intervention among themselves and with elements of the Turkish
                            political elite. However, our information suggests that intervention in
                            the period immediately ahead is unlikely. The failure of Demirel’s
                            effort to unseat <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> in June
                            has given <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> a breathing
                            space at least until the October elections. Barring some dramatic event
                            before then, it is unlikely the military will intervene.</p>
                        <p>4. In the past there have been signs of rumblings below the surface
                            before the military moved which have been picked up by our intelligence
                            reporting. We are not at present getting these types of signals. There
                            were some indications that senior military figures were discussing
                            intervention earlier during the spring but for the moment these have
                            tapered off. (Comment: If the coup plotters were relatively junior in
                            rank, the prospect of their carrying out preparations without it coming
                            to our attention would be greater.)</p>
                        <pb n="435" facs="0468" xml:id="pg_435"/>
                        <p>5. In any case, we believe that it would be difficult for the military to
                            intervene under present circumstances. The military establishment is
                            heavily preoccupied with its own internal problems. In order to justify
                            such action, maintain their prestige, and win broad public acceptance,
                            the military would need a rationale which does not exist at present.
                            There are, however, conceivable events which if they occurred might
                            provide a credible justification for action:</p>
                        <p>—Revolt in southeastern Turkey: Open revolt by Kurds in southeastern
                            Turkey or a spill over of fighting from neighboring Iran or Iraq would
                            probably lead the Turkish military to intervene, particularly if the
                            civilian leadership was seen as indecisive or capitulatory.</p>
                        <p>—Economic collapse: A disaster, such as a major crop failure or riots
                            protesting high prices and shortages might lead the military to feel
                            intervention was warranted. Agricultural production in 1979 should,
                            however, be high. Moreover, the Turkish people are by nature stoic.
                            Riots or nationwide strikes are not traditionally regarded as acceptable
                            forms of protest.</p>
                        <p>—Mishandling of a major incident: Bungling a serious outbreak of
                            violence, similar to the Kahramanmaras incidents of December 1978, the
                            1977 May 1 celebration in Istanbul or the Palestinian attack on the
                            Egyptian Embassy, could prompt military action.<note n="3"

                                Square Massacre, occurred during May Day celebrations in Istanbul,
                                when gunmen shot into a crowd, killing 36 and wounding over 200. On

                            sparked by the Demirel government’s mishandling of the kidnapping of

                            failure to appear decisive or consult fully with the military could

                        <p>—Political statemate—Perhaps the most likely cause for intervention would
                            be a prolonged political crisis in which the democratic process as
                            presently structured in Turkey appeared totally incapable of dealing
                            with the country’s many problems. Such a crisis might occur later this
                            year should the <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> government
                            fall and no clear alternative emerge. As noted in our earlier assessment
                            (Ankara 4193), pres<pb n="436" facs="0469" xml:id="pg_436"/>sures are

                        <p>6. In sum, while it is our judgment that military intervention is not
                            likely in the short run, we cannot be as confident about the medium
                            term. Turkey’s prolonged economic and political crisis has, according to
                            our Consulates in Izmir and Adana, begun to have an adverse effect on
                            the traditional stoicism of the Turkish public. The Consulates sense a
                            growing inclination among some elements of the Turkish elite to want the
                            military to intervene to “set things right.” As our earlier analysis
                            indicated, we doubt the current military leadership is inclined toward
                            intervention, but a failure of the political system in dealing with
                            Turkey’s political/economic crisis may alter this attitude.</p>

                                on the presumption that the latter aircraft would be more acceptable

                            any easier since the aircraft would be based in-country and a Turkish
                            crew member would be on board. This would mean even greater Turkish
                            involvement in an accord to which the <gloss target="#t_GOT_1"
                                >GOT</gloss> was not a party. The <gloss target="#t_NSC_1"
                                >NSC</gloss> could not advise the <gloss target="#t_GOT_1"
                                >GOT</gloss> to submit such a proposal to the Parliament.</p>
                        <p>5. The Prime Minister said that he hoped this would not harm our
                            relations, which have been improving thanks to the efforts of both
                            sides. This was not in any way a step backward from the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss>’s previous position. It was rather a
                            reaffirmation of the <gloss target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss>’s willingness
                            to proceed as originally discussed and agreed with <gloss

                            involved. <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> added, however,
                            that last week a Turkish Parliamentary delegation in Moscow on other
                            matters had talked with Soviet officials, in particular with Chairman of
                            the Council of the Union <persName corresp="#p_SAP_1"
                                >Shitikov</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_SAP_1"
                                >Shitikov</persName> had indicated “rigid Soviet opposition” to the
                            U–2 overflights. <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> commented
                            that the Soviets had brought up the matter themselves and their
                            opposition to the Turkish role was clear.</p>
                        <p>6. The Ambassador indicated that our judgment was that while the Soviets
                            could not openly agree to such a proposal they were unlikely to create
                            difficulties over the matter. Prime Minister stated that the Turkish
                            impression was precisely the opposite, but that if the Soviets did
                            change their attitude the <gloss target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> was ready
                            to proceed as previously discussed. The Ambassador noted that previous
                            discussions with the Soviets on national technical means (<gloss
                                target="#t_NTM_1">NTM</gloss>) had led us to conclude that while the
                            Soviets had expressed some sensitivity to third country involvement and
                            made clear that they did not want language sanctioning such practices in
                            any agreement, they nevertheless did not consider such systems as
                            unlawful.</p>
                        <p>7. The Prime Minister noted that as a matter of policy the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> did not discuss this issue with the
                            Soviets, but they had received other indications of Soviet displeasure.
                                <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> recalled that Brezhnev
                            had recently spoken of Soviet-Turkish relations in a somewhat cooler
                            tone than in the past and he felt that perhaps this might also be the
                            Soviet’s way of sending a message on the overflight issue. He also
                            wondered if the recent media reports which linked the Soviet combat
                            brigade in Cuba to US forces in Turkey might not be indicative of
                            another form of subtle Soviet pressure. <gloss target="#t_FonMin_1"
                                >FonMin</gloss> added that this attitude had also been evident in
                            his recent discussions with the Soviet Ambassador. <persName
                                corresp="#p_OG_1">Okcun</persName> asked that the US consider
                            further the “political feasibility” of its proposals and their impact on
                            Turkey.</p>
                        <p>8. Ambassador replied that the issue was both a political and substantive
                            one in the US. It had been carefully considered and the issue of assured
                            and dependable verification procedures could affect congressional
                            approval of <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>. The alternative to
                            the present proposal was [<hi rend="italic">2 lines not
                                declassified</hi>] and that might not be a politically viable
                            alternative for the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> administration.
                            Prime Minister observed that the modernization or improvement of
                            existing in-country facilities would be a much more palatable
                            alternative for Turkey. Ambassador replied that while we desired and
                            were discussing such modernization, particularly at [<hi rend="italic"
                                >less than 1 line not declassified</hi>], it was unfortunately not
                            the answer to the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II verification
                            problem since it could not pick up the required [<hi rend="italic">less
                                than 1 line not declassified</hi>].</p>
                        <p>9. Ambassador noted that one of our difficulties seemed to be differing
                            evaluations of the Soviet attitude. He said that he would report <pb
                                n="439" facs="0472" xml:id="pg_439"/>the Prime Minister’s remarks in
                            full and await further instructions on where we go from here.</p>
                        <p>11. Comment: I fear we are back to square one, and that the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss>—under present political
                            circumstances—will not accept the onus of agreeing to monitoring flights
                            while the Soviets are expressing opposition and might exploit this
                            against them. If there is an understanding (preferably explicit, but
                            possibly implicit) on both sides that “<gloss target="#t_NTM_1"
                                >NTM</gloss>” includes such systems as U–2’s, <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> will cooperate. If there is not,
                            they have convinced themselves agreeing will create major political
                            difficulties internally and bilaterally with <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                                >USSR</gloss>. As the above indicates, we are not likely to get the
                            Turks on board unless we can provide further evidence that the Soviets
                            will not react in a hostile manner detrimental to Turkish interests.
                            This in turn depends on our ability to persuade the Soviets that
                            agreement on this issue is crucial to obtaining congressional approval
                            for <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II. This brings me back to
                            one of our original suggestions, i.e., the possibility of a
                            congressional reservation relating third country verification efforts to
                            the definition of national technical means. If, in spite of the
                            administration’s best efforts, it appears that other reservations will
                            be attached to the Treaty, the inclusion of one along the above lines
                            would be most beneficial here. I also believe it would be useful for
                            Secretary to review this matter with Foreign Minister <persName

                                <persName corresp="#p_EK_1">Evren</persName> a few days ago surfaced
                            Turkish anxieties about her strategic position that we need <gloss

                            weakening in our own position. Some action suggestions are enumerated in
                                <gloss target="#t_para_1">para</gloss> 9. End summary.</p>
                        <p>3. Introduction: The upheaval in Iran documents the reasons for the
                            growing fears of Turkey’s security planners. Up to only a year ago
                            Turkey’s eastern flank was occupied by an imperial power devoted to
                            reinforcing its defenses and able to keep the Kurds in tow and Iraq,
                            armed by the Soviet Union, at bay. Now there is chaos in Iran, the Kurds
                            resurgent and Iraq without an effective counter weight. More
                            significantly perhaps, up to only a year ago Turkey was the strategic
                            half-way house to vital US and European interests in the Persian Gulf.
                            Today, Turkey is the easternmost reach of Western influence and power.
                            Our defensive links to the Gulf via Iran have been cut and the Turks see
                            themselves as geographically interposed between the Soviet Union and the
                            oil it will need to overcome projected deficits in the 1980’s. In my
                            judgment, the Turks have reason to be nervous.</p>
                        <p>4. A conversation with General <persName corresp="#p_EK_1"
                                >Evren</persName>: In a private dinner I had with General <persName
                                corresp="#p_EK_1">Evren</persName> on November 19—General <persName
                                corresp="#p_SH_1">Saltik</persName> and two other senior members of
                            the Turkish General Staff (<gloss target="#t_TGS_1">TGS</gloss>) also
                            were present, as were General <persName corresp="#p_TJ_1"
                                >Thompson</persName>, General Knudson and my <gloss
                                target="#t_MSA_1">MSA</gloss> Counselor—the chief [point] of the
                                <gloss target="#t_TGS_1">TGS</gloss>’s message was clear: in the
                            absence of a clearer US commitment to Turkish security and a greater US
                            willingness to address Turkey’s defense requirements, Turkey would have
                            no option but to adjust itself to the world which surrounds it.
                                <persName corresp="#p_EK_1">Evren</persName> did not threaten. He
                            has no illusions about the paucity of Turkey’s options. He understands
                            his country’s plight and knows that first priority must <pb n="442"
                                facs="0475" xml:id="pg_442"/>be given to its economic woes. He fully
                            appreciates the amount and generosity of our economic aid and he will
                            not ask his political masters to divert to defense money needed to
                            repair the economy. Furthermore, he knows that his country is
                            politically isolated from its Balkan and Arab neighbors and the wider
                            third world. He did not ask for <gloss target="#t_MAP_1">MAP</gloss>,
                            nor did he make a bid for more <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss>
                            credits. He acknowledged his dependence upon outside military
                            assistance. At the same time, he did not want the <gloss
                                target="#t_TGS_1">TGS</gloss> to add to Turkey’s economic troubles
                            by piling up increasingly costly <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss>
                            debts.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_EK_1">Evren</persName> wanted a signal, greater
                            proof that we would stand by Turkey. He asked that we translate what
                            limited military aid we could provide into hardware, by making
                            deliveries from stocks. He also urged that we reduce Turkey’s <gloss
                                target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> burden so that almost half of what we
                            give in new money is not offset by debt service requirements. He saw the
                            installations agreement as an aspect of a broader problem: the need to
                            restore a healthy and viable US-Turkish security relationship, which
                            would be symbolized by the signing of a multi-year defense agreement. He
                            summed up his points by saying that before embarking unreservedly once
                            again on the American route to security, his country would have to be
                            reassured that “the weather would remain fair along the entire course of
                            the journey”.</p>
                        <p>6. The response I was able to make—that until its economy becomes
                            stronger Turkey must depend for its security on an unambiguous
                            commitment to <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>—seemed inadequate.
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> guarantees in this part of
                            the world are credible only to the extent our actions make them so.
                            Having said this, no one is more aware than I that Turkey makes being
                            generous difficult. I made this point to <persName corresp="#p_EK_1"
                                >Evren</persName> by contrasting Turkey’s manner with that of
                                <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>; of Turkey’s holding
                            back versus <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>’s constant
                            search for mutually supportive initiatives. I urged <persName
                                corresp="#p_EK_1">Evren</persName> and his colleagues to “bet on the
                            come”, that their tie to the United States was their only real option
                            and that they should act accordingly. But my confidence that we would
                            respond to positive gestures had to be caveated. When <persName
                                corresp="#p_EK_1">Evren</persName> asked about a long-term guarantee
                            of military aid I could offer only prospects for an improved climate and
                            express my belief that the probabilities of good weather would be
                            enhanced by positive Turkish actions.</p>
                        <p>7. It seems to me that the trend of events in this strategic corner of
                            the world requires a fresh display of US determination. We have done
                            much for Turkey already—stimulating a $961 million multilateral economic
                            aid program and the doubling of direct US aid in one year—but
                            realistically more is needed and we should be ready to do more to avert
                            further deterioration or to respond to a more <persName
                                corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>-like Turkish stance.</p>
                        <p>8. I share <persName corresp="#p_EK_1">Evren</persName>’s perception of
                            the defense agreement, that it is more important as a symbol of our
                            reestablished relationship than as a <pb n="443" facs="0476"
                                xml:id="pg_443"/>cover for the installations agreement. As I have
                            stated in the past, I see little threat to the continued operations of
                            our facilities. My apprehension has been and remains that unless we are
                            more responsive in the security area our relations with the <gloss
                                target="#t_TGS_1">TGS</gloss> and with the other elements of
                            Turkey’s security establishment will deteriorate with all this implies
                            in terms of US interest. In this context signature of a long-term
                            defense agreement may have to await our willingness to reinforce our
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> commitment to Turkish
                            security with more tangible assurances that Turkey will have access to
                            US defense equipment and on the best possible terms including a high but
                            not exclusive priority to such excess defense articles as may become
                            available. We also may have to underscore our current “best effort”
                            pledge of continuing security assistance with an Inouye–Marcos type
                            congressional guarantee.<note n="2" xml:id="d145fn2">Reference is to a

                                1978 visit by Senator Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii), who convinced
                                Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos that the terms of the aid

                            recognize that neither branch of our government has been prepared to
                            pledge its word in these ways in view of congressional problems or lack
                            of progress on Cyprus, etc. but events in Iran and Pakistan urge that we

                            with in a week, but during my consultations in Washington I would like
                            to explore some specific suggestions as to what we might do:</p>
                        <p>—The Turks hope that I will return with the <gloss target="#t_FY_1"
                                >FY</gloss> 81 aid figures and repayment terms.</p>
                        <p>—They are also hoping for at least a partial response to their request
                            for <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> debt relief.</p>
                        <p>—They are closely watching the prospects for our delivering in the next
                            year or so some high visibility items of defense equipment drawn from
                            their equipment list. My staff has some ideas on what items would be
                            most responsive—</p>
                        <p>Air Force: attrition aircraft including about 15 F4’s, some F100’s, 10–20
                            T37’s and at a later date some more T–38’s;</p>
                        <p>Navy: favorable resolution of the leases on the two gearing destroyers;
                            and</p>
                        <p>Army: accelerated delivery of modernization kits for a small number of

                        <p>2. Summary. In a pleasant and low-key fashion the new Turkish Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_EH_1">Erkmen</persName> set out to
                            introduce himself to the Secretary and establish his credentials as a
                            long-time friend of <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> and supporter
                            of strong relations between Turkey and the United States. He then
                            presented a short list of requests concerning the size of military
                            assistance for <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1981, debt suspension
                            for outstanding <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> loans, the supply
                            of military equipment, and rapid conclusion of the defense cooperation
                            negotiations. He did this in a general and non-demanding fashion. After
                            the meeting was over, the Turkish <gloss target="#t_PermRep_1"
                                >PermRep</gloss> to <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>,

                                <persName corresp="#p_BWT_1">Bennett</persName> with a talking paper
                            that made similar points, but in greater detail. This paper can be found

                        <p>3. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> welcomed the
                            new Turkish Foreign Minister and told him that he looked forward to
                            working with him. The Turkish Foreign Minister said he was pleased that
                            the American Secretary of State had agreed to meet with him so soon. He
                            said that he did not want to refer back to past history in the
                            relationship, only wanted to mention that he was a member of a
                            government that was known to have always valued a strong relationship
                            with the United States. He said he would have only a few issues to
                            raise, and he would be very happy to receive a quick reaction from the
                            Secretary.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_EH_1">Erkmen</persName> mentioned the severe
                            economic problems faced by Turkey and the longstanding force commitments
                            it had made to the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> Alliance. He
                            said that taking these two facts together should lead the United States
                            to have broad understanding for Turkey’s problems. <persName
                                corresp="#p_EH_1">Erkmen</persName> then recalled that in the <gloss
                                target="#t_NAC_1">NAC</gloss> Ministerial meeting earlier in the day
                            he had mentioned his having been the youngest member of the Turkish
                            Cabinet that in the 1950’s had decided to join <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss>. Now he remarked he is the oldest member of the new
                            Turkish Government that wishes to develop and strengthen its
                            relationship with <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>. It was in the
                            spirit of friendship and Alliance that he wished to raise several
                            specific issues.</p>
                        <p>—Overdue <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> debts. He asked that these
                            be treated with full understanding.</p>
                        <p>—The Turkish five-year equipment list: <persName corresp="#p_EH_1"
                                >Erkmen</persName> said that the United States and Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> were surely aware of
                            the quality problems of Turkish armed force equipment. He said that a
                            five-year list of equipment for the 1980’s had been presented to the
                            United States recently, and he hoped that the Government of the United
                            States would find a way to help provide for these equipment needs.</p>
                        <p>—<gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1981 budget: He said that the Turkish
                            Prime Minister would very much appreciate hearing from President
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>, if that were
                            possible, with respect to the US <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 81
                            budget requests for assistance to Turkey. Turkey hoped that a letter
                            from the American President could make the point that the United States
                            will be favorably inclined and will do its best to help Turkey and to
                            strengthen the relationship. (For further elaboration, see <gloss

                            signed before the January 9 date set by the previous government.</p>

                        <p>5. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> responded that
                            the United States and the present administration sincerely valued the
                            relationship with Turkey. The effort made last year during one of tight
                            budget stringency to provide Turkey with 450 million dollars in
                            assistance, an amount which was only surpassed by Israel and Egypt in
                            the whole world, surely demonstrated that commitment. The budget for
                                <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1981 is presently under
                            preparation. The Secretary told <persName corresp="#p_EH_1"
                                >Erkmen</persName> that he is scheduled to meet with President
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> on December 18 to
                            discuss the security assistance elements of the budget.<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d146fn3">No substantive record of this meeting was
                                found.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> also mentioned that he had
                            forwarded to the President a request for a substantial sum for Turkey,
                            but that it was premature to comment in any detail. He said that as soon
                            as a decision was made, he would be happy to get word to Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_EH_1">Erkmen</persName>. <persName
                                corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> reiterated that the size of the
                            commitment undertaken by the United States last year surely demonstrates
                            to Turkey the importance the United States attaches to helping Turkey
                            fulfill its needs and the value the United States places on the
                            relationship. <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> told
                                <persName corresp="#p_EH_1">Erkmen</persName> that in attempting to
                            help Turkey in this way and to build the relationship, he was not
                            referring to all of Turkey’s specific economic and financial problems
                            which the United States was also attempting to respond to.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_EH_1">Erkmen</persName> said he wished to raise
                            one further issue in connection with the 1980 assistance earmarked for
                            Turkey. Of the 198 million in assistance, 100 million has been received,
                            but 98 million is apparently subject to some difficulty in the US
                            Congress and Turkey has not been able to use any of it. He said this was
                            currently a major problem because Turkey is facing special difficulties
                            in purchasing petroleum products.</p>
                        <p>7. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> asked
                            Counselor <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> whether the bill
                            was still held up in conference. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1"
                                >Nimetz</persName> said it was, but that the dispute had nothing to
                            do with the 98 million dollar assistance for Turkey. The US side
                            expressed the hope that this bottleneck would be over soon. <persName
                                corresp="#p_EH_1">Erkmen</persName> said he did not wish to question
                            the details only hoped the problem would be resolved in the very near
                            term.</p>
                        <p>8. Defense negotiations: <persName corresp="#p_EH_1">Erkmen</persName>
                            said that his experts have reported that no major problems remain in the
                            defense agreement negotiations and that there could be a signing very
                            soon of the basic agreement. He then referred to some of the appendices
                            and attached agreements and said that while it might be tempting to want
                            to sign just the basic agreement and keep working on the others,
                            problems were sometimes caused in this way and Turkey would prefer to
                            resolve all of the issues promptly so that all of the agreements could
                            be signed. <pb n="447" facs="0480" xml:id="pg_447"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> agreed that the two
                            countries were very close to consummating the basic agreement and hoped
                            to be able to do so by January 9. Insofar as the related attachments
                            were concerned, realistically speaking it might be hard to get them all
                            ready by January 9, though the United States would like to accomplish
                            that. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> said that in his
                            view the negotiations have been going well for both sides, but that the
                            structure of all the agreements is such that it might be very difficult
                            to get perhaps as many as 90 separate documents ready in time. The
                            Turkish negotiator, <persName corresp="#p_SF_1">Sahinbas</persName>,
                            interjected that it should be possible to get all the agreements done
                            since many of these were “standard documents.” Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> suggested that Counselor
                                <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> and the Turkish
                            negotiator get together on Friday to discuss this matter further and see
                            what could be done. (<gloss target="#t_septel_1">septel</gloss>).<note

                            <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> affirmed that the United
                            States also wanted very much to resolve this matter quickly. <persName
                                corresp="#p_EH_1">Erkmen</persName> then said he had no further
                            issues which he wished to raise.</p>
                        <p>9. Cyprus: Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> said
                            that he would like to discuss the Cyprus problem since he understands
                            that it may be possible to get the intercommunal talks resumed soon if
                                <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> issued a new
                            invitation cum suggestion. <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>
                            said an early resumption of the talks would be in everyone’s interests.
                            In order to get the talks restarted, therefore, Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> asked Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_EH_1">Erkmen</persName> to do whatever he could to
                            convince the interested parties to cooperate. <persName
                                corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_EH_1"
                                >Erkmen</persName> that he had asked Greek Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> to do the same, who
                            had agreed. <persName corresp="#p_EH_1">Erkmen</persName> assured the
                            Secretary that he could be certain that the Turkish Foreign Minister
                            would not want to fall behind Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RG_1"
                                >Rallis</persName> in this question and that <persName
                                corresp="#p_EH_1">Erkmen</persName>, too, would do all that he
                            could.</p>
                        <p>10. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> then asked
                            the Foreign Minister to please convey his respects and best wishes to
                            Prime Minister Demirel and to also pass along similar expressions of
                            respect from President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>.
                                <persName corresp="#p_EH_1">Erkmen</persName> replied that he too
                            had left this important question for last and wished to pass along Prime
                            Minister Demirel’s high regards and best wishes to Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> and President <persName

                        <p>11. In conclusion, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1"
                                >Vance</persName> asked Counselor <persName corresp="#p_NM_1"

                            and signing of the defense agreement and for his part, he undertook to
                            do what he could to get the <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 81 budget

                                <pb n="449" facs="0482" xml:id="pg_449"/>actually is signed;
                            hopefully, in the near future. The Defense Agreement is an executive
                            agreement which pledges only “best efforts” to secure needed economic
                            and military assistance for Turkey. The letter would constitute the
                            President’s personal recognition of his responsibility to make such an
                            effort and will allow the <gloss target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> to fall
                            off their position that they must have a specific pledge of money or
                            equipment. Neither <gloss target="#t_OMB_1">OMB</gloss> nor the <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> staff have indicated concern about our
                            wish to have such a letter as long as it does not contain any specific
                            dollar commitment.</p>
                        <p>To assure the best atmosphere for the talks, I will need to be in a
                            position to tell the Turks that we will be disbursing part of our <gloss

                            and that we are prepared to negotiate an agreement allowing them to

                            the Continuing Resolution even though the Congressional Conference

                            Bill.</p>
                        <p>There will be two main contentious issues in the negotiation:</p>
                        <p>(1) The Turks want to complete the entire agreement, including all
                            annexes before signing or initialing any of its parts. This will be
                            almost impossible because of the sheer volume of documents, and also
                            because a number of the technical annexes contain points of difference
                            which we probably will not be able to resolve during my visit.</p>
                        <p>(2) The second issue is one of substance. The Turks will hold very
                            strongly that the foundation agreement should specifically preclude any
                            use of the facilities by American forces except for narrowly-defined
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> purposes.<note n="7"
                                xml:id="d147fn7">
                                <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> underlined the two
                                previous sentences.</note> We want as much flexibility as possible
                            in potential use of the bases, even though we recognize that no
                            activities would be possible without the complete consent of the Turks.
                            Finding an appropriate compromise on this point will probably be the
                            major challenge of my visit.</p>
                        <p>My goal in the January 6–9 talks is to initial a foundation agreement
                            and, if possible, three supplemental agreements (defense support,
                            defense industrial cooperation, and installations). These agreements
                            would then be referred back to governments for early review, so that the
                            Turks could feel that a signing ceremony might take place within a
                            reasonable period.</p>

                        <p>Today’s signing of the Agreement on Security and Economic Cooperation
                            marks an important milestone in the relations between the Republic of
                            Turkey and the United States of America.<note n="2" xml:id="d148fn2">See

                        </p>
                        <p>For more than a generation the Turkish and American peoples have had a
                            flourishing relationship as allies and as fellow members of the Atlantic
                            community. Indeed, our friendship is older than <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> itself. That friendship is based on
                            common democratic values, peaceful ideals, and strong cultural and
                            humanitarian ties.</p>

                        <p>The new agreement is a solemn commitment on the part of the United States
                            to assist in strengthening the armed forces as well as the economy of
                            the Turkish Republic. It recognizes Turkey’s crucial contribution to the
                            Alliance, and addresses critical questions of defense and economic
                            cooperation. It is my firm conviction that Turkey should be assisted in
                            every feasible way, and I regard this effort as a high personal priority
                            of my own.</p>
                        <p>In signing this agreement, we enable both our countries to face the
                            future with confidence and to look forward to a new era of mutual
                            endeavor, based on the trust that underlies the cooperation between
                            sovereign states that are not only allies but friends.</p>

                        <p>As you are aware, Mr. President, both our Governments have acted with a

                            to the lofty goals of which our two countries are dedicated. It gives me
                            particular pleasure to see the Agreement for Cooperation on Defence and

                                initialed on January 10, committed the United States to the military
                                and economic support of Turkey, but did not specify levels of aid
                                for either the economic or military spheres. The agreement also
                                established a joint <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Turkey

                            this region will be the determining factor in rendering support and
                            assistance to Turkey with a view to enabling my country to carry out
                            properly her <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> obligations. The
                            level of the assistance must, I believe, take also care of the necessity

                        <p rend="center">Summary</p>
                        <p>Turkey remains beset by political, economic, and internal security
                            problems with which Prime Minister Demirel’s minority government seems
                            scarcely able to cope. Spiraling political violence is evolving into
                            mass unrest. If unchecked, it could turn into open insurrection or civil
                            war. Lack of foreign exchange has caused the economy to grind to a halt,
                            further fueling the political violence. [<hi rend="italic">handling

                        <p>Together with continued jockeying and partisanship by Turkey’s political
                            leaders, these developments have impelled military leaders to become
                            more involved in the political process. Their demand in early January
                            that the squabbling politicians unite to solve Turkey’s problems nudged
                            the government into taking stronger action on both violence and the
                            economy and has evoked some grudging cooperation from other political
                                parties.<note n="2" xml:id="d150fn2">This demand was reported in

                                elements in Turkish society which had called for either a Communist
                                revolution, a theocracy, or a fascist state. (Sam Cohen, “Turk

                            But interparty feuding has continued, and the onrush of events leaves
                            the impression of a government still lacking control. In a followup
                            statement, Turkey’s senior military leader warned that time is running
                            out for a democratic solution to Turkey’s problems, and there are other
                            indications that the military’s patience is wearing thin. [<hi

                        <p>About the only bright spots for Turkey and for Western interests in this
                            bleak picture are the government’s economic stabilization program, which
                            contains the kind of medicine that the economy needs, and Demirel’s
                            pro-Western orientation, which has made Turkey more sensitive to the
                            concerns of the West. Turkey’s friends and allies have <pb n="454"
                                facs="0487" xml:id="pg_454"/>reacted favorably to the government’s
                            moves and are following up their 1979 rescue effort with an even bigger

                        <p>Whether Turkey’s continued slide can be arrested—or at least slowed—will
                            depend on a number of factors. Though hard on the public, the
                            stabilization measures will have to be implemented firmly and left in
                            place long enough to be effective. Turkey will need to secure prompt and
                            relatively easy access to foreign funds to buy oil and other necessities
                            to get industry and agriculture moving again and to alleviate public
                            hardship. Political violence and mass unrest will also have to be
                            contained. These are demanding requirements for Turkey’s leaders and
                            allies, and the Turkish military is likely to deem it necessary to play
                            a more forceful role in solving the country’s mounting problems. [<hi

                        <p>2. Dept has impression that the concept of a “military solution” may be
                            gaining support from Turks who have lost hope in their system and see no
                            other remedy for the problems which beset it. Indeed, the current scene
                            in Turkey seems pregnant with portent: the manifest inability of the
                            system to cap the spiral of violence, a deadlocked Parliament, a
                            minority government with eroding support, incessant bickering among
                            party leaders, the slowness of the economic turnaround, repeated but
                            ineffectual warnings by <gloss target="#t_TGS_1">TGS</gloss> leaders,

                            form of a coup a la 1960 or extra-legal steps a la 1971 that would make
                            the <gloss target="#t_TGS_1">TGS</gloss> the dominant political force in
                                Turkey.<note n="3" xml:id="d151fn3">Unlike the 1960 coup, the coup
                                of March 12, 1971, did not involve actual assumption of rule by the
                                military, but a coup “by communiqué” when military generals ordered
                                Prime Minister Demirel to resign or face removal. Demirel promptly
                                resigned. Eight days after the communiqué, <persName

                                acceptable to the military.</note>

                        <p>3. We are less concerned by the form that such a step might take than by
                            the prospect that it could be gaining respectability and support. <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> officials have repeatedly and
                            emphatically stated that, given adequate external resources, the Turkish
                            Republic can overcome its massive problems. We remain convinced that
                            this is so. Indeed, our public statements, congressional testimony, and
                            private demarches have supported aid to Turkey inter alia as an
                            investment in stabilizing the democratic system of an embattled ally and
                            friend. We know that your Mission has been making, and will continue to
                            make, the same points, e.g., <gloss target="#t_para_1">para</gloss> 8,
                            ref A.</p>
                        <p>4. Nevertheless, in view of the growing public currency of the notion of
                            a “military solution,” it is necessary to review whether there are other
                            appropriate and available means to reinforce our posture on this
                            subject. It is possible that our message, through repetition and the
                            passage of time, has lost its audience and that Turks no longer take it
                            as seriously as they once did. If this is so, our problem is how to deal
                            with a “military solution” phenomenon which may be reality or illusion.
                            On one hand, we do not want to acquiesce in a brewing and real threat to
                            Turkish democracy. On the other hand, we do not want to react to
                            rumor-mongering. Unfortunately, the two are not always possible to
                            differentiate. Our main concern, therefore, is to continue to make sure
                            that Turkish leaders, civilian and repeat and military, clearly
                            understand that the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>:</p>

                        <p>—believes that any such action would have a catastrophic impact on
                            Turkey’s bilateral relationship with its allies by gravely undermining
                            their—and our—ability to respond to Turkish needs for economic and
                            military support; and</p>
                        <p>—does not believe that present circumstances, admittedly difficult and
                            trying, warrant even abstract consideration of this step.</p>
                        <p>5. We remain confident that Turkey will ultimately find the answers it

                        <p>2. Summary: Secretary met for approximately 70 minutes, June 24, with
                            Turkish Prime Minister Demirel, Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_EH_1">Erkmen</persName>, and other Turkish officials
                            prior to opening of <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> Ministerial
                            session. Demirel was preoccupied with current debate in Turkish
                            Parliament on censure motion directed against his government but was
                            relaxed and confident that barring unforeseen developments he would be
                            able defeat motion next week. Without making specific requests except
                            for rescheduling of Turkey’s debt falling due in 1981 and 1982, as well
                            as 1980, Demirel emphasized <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> role
                            of Turkey, commitment to democratic system, and willingness to resolve
                            differences with Greeks through negotiations and to see resumed Cyprus
                            talks. He indicated Turkish willingness be helpful on Iranian hostage
                            situation. Secretary said we realized importance of strong, economically
                            healthy Turkey and its strategic location. US was willing to continue be
                            helpful in meeting Turkish requirements. He expressed appreciation for
                            Turkish Olympic boycott and for willingness help on Iranian hostage
                                problem.<note n="3" xml:id="d152fn3">On May 22, the Turkish
                                Government decided to join the international boycott of the Olympic
                                winter games to be held in Moscow. The boycott, led by the United
                                States, signaled each participating nation’s protest of the Soviet
                                invasion of Afghanistan. <persName corresp="#p_CWH_1"

                                “Nowhere is this message more meaningful,” <persName

                        <p>3. After the press and photographers had left his office, Turkish Prime
                            Minister Demirel opened his meeting with Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_MES_1">Muskie</persName> with a 30 minute presentation.
                            Demirel said he was happy to welcome the Foreign Ministers of Turkey’s
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> allies to Ankara for the
                            first such meeting here since 1960. He recalled that Turkey for many
                            years had very good and friendly relations with the US which served a
                            mutual interest for both countries. There had been some trouble during
                            the arms embargo period but both countries knew the value of their
                            relations to the entire Alliance.</p>
                        <p>4. Demirel said he was firmly convinced that a weak Turkey would not be
                            in the interest of either the Turkish people, its allies, or its
                            neighbors. He was determined to build Turkey’s strength. The Prime
                            Minister also pointed out that of the 156 members of the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>, only 23 had free democratic systems of
                            government and of these only 2 (India and Japan) were in Asia in
                            addition to Turkey. Turkey was geographically part of both Asia and
                            Europe but he felt strongly that Europe and <pb n="458" facs="0491"
                                xml:id="pg_458"/>the Western community should not end at the
                            Bulgaria/Greek border. Turkey had been able to keep its free democratic
                            party system for 34 years and was determined in its own interest to
                            continue such a system. Turkey was also determined to carry out its
                            responsibility to defend itself and to cooperate with others for the
                            common defense of <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>. Turkey had
                            never failed to fulfill its <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                            commitments.</p>
                        <p>5. Demirel stressed the importance of economic strength. According to his
                            figures, Turkey now ranked 52 among <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                            members in terms of per capita income. It has enormous potential
                            resources, including a hardworking, able people. Economic trends have
                            been good from 1963 to 1978 when 7 percent annual real growth had been
                            achieved. Economic stability had been the pattern during this period,
                            even though, according to Demirel, there had been too many governments.
                            In the 1978/79 period Turkey had been afflicted with heavy inflation
                            which his government in the last seven months had tried to fight through
                            unpopular measures. There had been good support from the people and the
                            program was having results. This approach would be continued. Demirel
                            was grateful for Western assistance and understanding. He hoped for a
                            very good harvest in 1980 but noted the high cost of imported
                            petroleum.</p>
                        <p>6. With regard to equipment for the military forces, Demirel said that
                            $800 million was needed this year to keep the forces at the same level
                            and that approximately $4.5 billion would be required over the next five
                            to six years. Turkish resources were very limited but they were doing
                            their best.</p>
                        <p>7. Reverting again to the economic situation, Demirel noted improved
                            price performance over the last three months as well as some increase in
                            industrial activity. He said that the <gloss target="#t_IMF_1"
                                >IMF</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_IBRD_1">IBRD</gloss>, and <gloss
                                target="#t_OECD_1">OECD</gloss> have shown good understanding as had
                            national assistance organizations. His goal was “expansion within
                            stability.” This would take time but he expressed confidence.</p>
                        <p>8. With respect to relations with the Greeks, Demirel said that the
                            existence of problems and disputes should not lead to confrontation or
                            hostile relations. Disputes should be settled through negotiation since
                            confrontation would serve the purpose of the common enemy of Turkey and
                            Greece. He thought it important to try to find solutions through
                            negotiations and peaceful means and hoped that the Greeks would not
                            think that a strong Turkey would be a greater problem for Greece.</p>
                        <p>9. Demirel commended the recently signed Defense and Economic Cooperation
                            Agreement as serving the interests of both Turkey and the US. He said
                            that it would get through the Turkish Parliament and that having such
                            approval would avoid potential problems later. In any event, the <gloss
                                target="#t_DECA_1">DECA</gloss> was already in force so there was no
                            great ruse to get <pb n="459" facs="0492" xml:id="pg_459"/>it through
                            Parliament. Demirel said he appreciated what the US had done in the past
                            and he realized the value of Turkey’s strategic location from the US
                            point of view.</p>
                        <p>10. With regard to Iran, Demirel said that no civilized person could
                            approve of the holding of the hostages. Turkey had suffered from the
                            shooting of Turkish Ambassadors abroad and felt strongly that diplomats
                            should enjoy protection. The hostage problem was not just that of the US
                            but of the entire world. He said it is very difficult to know who had
                            government power in Iran but doubted that most of the Iranian people
                            support holding the hostages. He noted the danger of pushing Iran toward
                            the Soviets but stressed that the Turkish Government would do its best
                            if it could be of any help in the hostage problem. They had tried in the
                            past to be helpful. They believed it important not to cut relations with
                            their neighbor but rather to keep open a window which might in the
                            future be helpful.</p>
                        <p>11. In closing, Demirel said he wanted to raise one other matter, namely
                            the recent meeting in Paris to reschedule Turkey’s debts.<note n="4"

                                Consortium to Aid Turkey began negotiations in Paris in June on
                                rescheduling $2.2 billion of Turkey’s debts to foreign governments.
                                (Ann Crittenden, “I.M.F. Grants Turkey Record $1.6 Billion Loan,”
                                    <hi rend="italic">The New York Times,</hi> June 19, 1980, p. D1)
                            </note> He thought it important that Turkey have full support during the
                            next three to five years to pull its economy together. The particular
                            matter where he hoped the US could do something involved debts already
                            postponed in 1978/79. He hoped these debts could again be rescheduled
                            covering not only 1980 but also the next two years. He said he would
                            appreciate anything the Secretary could do.</p>
                        <p>12. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MES_1">Muskie</persName> responded
                            that he was delighted to be making his first visit to Turkey. The US had
                            strong feelings of friendship and understanding toward Turkey. The
                            Secretary wished to convey to the Prime Minister and to the Government
                            and people of Turkey the personal best wishes of President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>. In the short period that he
                            had been Secretary of State he had often discussed with the President
                            the common interests we share with Turkey. We agree fully that Turkey
                            must be strong. The Secretary recalled that a year ago as a Senator he
                            had undertaken at the request of the President a mission to Europe,
                            including West Germany where the top item for discussion was the Turkish
                            aid package. Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_SH_3">Schmidt</persName>
                            had exercised effective leadership. We continued to be very supportive
                            in all ways we could of that initiative.</p>
                        <p>13. The Secretary noted that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            bilateral aid program for Turkey was one of the largest during a period
                            of budget austerity and general unpopularity in Congress of foreign aid.
                            We recognized that as <pb n="460" facs="0493" xml:id="pg_460"/>a <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> member, the strength of Turkey was
                            important to the Alliance and that the events of the past six months had
                            further enhanced the need for stability in the area. The Secretary
                            stressed that there should be no doubt about US willingness to be as
                            helpful as we could since our mutual interest was served.</p>
                        <p>14. Following these opening remarks, the Secretary told the Prime
                            Minister that he would like to raise several specific subjects. The US
                            very much appreciated Turkey’s support on the Olympic boycott. The
                            latest information was that some 62 countries would not be in
                            Moscow.</p>
                        <p>15. The Secretary said he was aware of and appreciated Turkey’s interest
                            in the hostage problem. We were undertaking quiet, indirect diplomatic
                            approaches in an effort to persuade Iran to release the hostages. He
                            hoped that other countries, even those which had not imposed sanctions,
                            would refrain from full normal relations with Iran since, as the Prime
                            Minister had said, all governments were affected. As a neighbor, Turkey
                            might have an opportunity to influence the Iranian decision process and
                            we would welcome any help that could be provided.</p>
                        <p>16. The Secretary said that based on Under Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName>’ visit to Athens on June 23, he
                            believed the Government of Greece wants very much to rejoin <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> and to do so as soon as
                                possible.<note n="5" xml:id="d152fn5">See <ref target="#d203"
                                    >Document 203</ref>.</note> He thought the US and Turkey must
                            find ways to make that possible. General <persName corresp="#p_RBW_1"
                                >Rogers</persName> was working on the problem with the Turkish
                            General Staff and other <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> military
                            authorities and had received good cooperation. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RBW_1">Rogers</persName> and <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss> would set the terms and conditions but the Secretary
                            wanted the <gloss target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> to know of our strong
                            interest in early reintegration. This devolved in part because our
                            facilities in Greece served <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                            defense objectives. Greek reintegration was an important objective for
                            the US and Greece; the Greek elections in 1981 could result in a change
                            in climate that would affect resolution of this issue.</p>
                        <p>17. Regarding Cyprus, the Secretary said he recognized that the Prime
                            Minister knew of the interest of Congress and the widespread frustration
                            that there had been no movement in the last year or two. It would
                            greatly help both Turkey and the US if ways could be found to get a
                            Cyprus solution moving. The situation was stagnant. He recognized that
                            Demirel had other problems but he wanted to emphasize our interest in a
                            Cyprus settlement. The Secretary said he did not fully understand the
                            recent problems with <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> intercommunal
                            talks but he hoped something could be done.<note n="6" xml:id="d152fn6"
                                >See <ref target="#d77">Document 77</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="461" facs="0494" xml:id="pg_461"/>
                        <p>18. With respect to debt rescheduling, the Secretary said that Congress
                            is sometimes very reluctant to see debt relief granted and that this
                            consideration did not involve just Turkey. There were budgetary aspects
                            and we ordinarily engaged in debt rescheduling only in cases of greatest
                            urgency. However, we would continue to study this matter on returning to
                            Washington.</p>
                        <p>19. At the suggestion of the Secretary, Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJW_1">Spain</persName> noted Executive Branch and
                            congressional interest in early Turkish ratification of the Prisoner
                            Transfer Treaty.<note n="7" xml:id="d152fn7">Reference is to the
                                International Prisoner Transfer Program. The United States began in
                                1977 to negotiate treaties with other countries to allow prisoners
                                to be transferred from the country in which they were incarcerated
                                to their native country. Turkey entered into an agreement with the
                                United States on January 1, 1981. (32 UST 3187)</note> He noted that
                            there were four long term prisoners in Turkish prisons and asked about
                            the Parliamentary prospects. The Prime Minister said it would go through
                            Parliament.</p>
                        <p>20. Ambassador said he had been impressed in his recent consultations
                            with Congress about the wide appreciation of Turkish democracy as well
                            as the contribution Turkey makes to the strength of the free world. The
                            Secretary said there indeed was a new appreciation of the strategic
                            importance of Turkey. We also had a different perception of the Persian
                            Gulf which further increased our mutual interests with Turkey. Both
                            national interest and shared values were arguments buttressing the
                            importance of helping Turkey and further strengthening of ties. He
                            thought Congress wanted to be supportive but that Turkey’s help was also
                            needed.</p>
                        <p>21. Demirel stressed that Turkey was not against reintegration of Greek
                            forces into <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> and recognized that
                            it was in the interest of Turkey and all the other Allies. Greek forces
                            would be welcome to come back although he noted that no one had pushed
                            Greece from <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>. However, things had
                            changed and there were disputes about the continental shelf and lines
                            relating to air space. When such lines were called borders it became
                            even more difficult. Demirel said he had talked to General <persName
                                corresp="#p_RBW_1">Rogers</persName> and there had been frank
                            conversations with the Chief of <gloss target="#t_TGS_1">TGS</gloss>.
                            The <gloss target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> was willing to agree to a
                            reasonable solution, one which could be defended to Turkish public
                            opinion. He recognized that the <gloss target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss> had
                            its own public opinion to consider. He recalled that the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss> had refused proposals made by both
                            General <persName corresp="#p_RBW_1">Rogers</persName> and General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> but he thought this
                            question should and could be worked out in military channels.</p>
                        <p>22. On Cyprus, Demirel said he thought the Greek Cypriots still wanted to
                            go back to the pre-1974 situation. The two communities simply could not
                            live together again. They needed to live separately with a line between
                            two zones but within a federal state. Turkey was <pb n="462" facs="0495"
                                xml:id="pg_462"/>willing to have a Cyprus agreement. He noted,
                            however, that Cyprus had been quiet for six years, the longest such
                            period in modern history. Cyprus was costly to Turkey. Agreement on a
                            federal system with federated states for the two communities would be
                            the key to an agreement. Even Archbishop <persName corresp="#p_M3_1"
                                >Makarios</persName> had accepted bizonality before his death but
                            the Greek Cypriots subsequently retreated from that position. The
                            Turkish side was willing to negotiate and was not causing trouble. He
                            had stressed to <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Secretary General
                                <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> in Belgrade that
                            the Turkish side would be reasonable.</p>
                        <p>23. The Secretary asked whether in a bizonal system there could be any
                            shifting of territory. Demirel said territory was subject to
                            negotiation. Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_NM_1"
                                >Nimetz</persName> noted how hard it was even to get intercommunal
                            negotiations started; there had been not much more than 10 hours at the
                            table in the last 3½ years. Demirel said there was no other way. The
                            people on the island who would have to live together must negotiate
                            together. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> said there is a
                            Greek perception that <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName>
                            will not start negotiating until the Greek Cypriots agree to all his
                            pre-conditions, particularly bizonality. Demirel said that was not
                            correct, but there could be no solution so long as they rejected
                            bizonality. In response to a question from Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJW_1">Spain</persName>, the Turkish side said that the
                            Government of Greece would not talk about Cyprus bilaterally with
                            Turkey.</p>
                        <p>24. Demirel returned again to the importance of a favorable rescheduling
                            of Turkey’s debt covering about $1 billion for all countries in 1981/82.
                            He did not think the burden would be that great for the US and it would
                            be a great help to Turkey. The US role was very important. The Secretary
                            said we would look into it again and would consider what could be done.
                            We had solved other problems together and perhaps this one could be
                            resolved as well. He recognized debt scheduling was part of an
                            integrated package. He had discussed this with Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJW_1">Spain</persName> and also noted that Turkey had
                            been on the minds of the seven summit countries at Venice.<note n="8"
                                xml:id="d152fn8">The Venice G–7 Summit, attended by the leaders of

                                Commission, took place June 22–23.</note> It had also been mentioned
                            in a conversation with <persName corresp="#p_SH_3"
                            >Schmidt</persName>.</p>
                        <p>25. In response to the Secretary’s question about current political
                            developments in Turkey, Demirel thought that barring unforeseen
                            developments, he would have the necessary votes to defeat a censure
                            motion which was being discussed in the Parliament immediately after the
                            meeting with the Secretary. The actual critical vote would be next week.
                            In response to the Secretary’s comment that Demirel did not look under
                            tension, the Prime Minister said he “loved fights”; democracy <pb
                                n="463" facs="0496" xml:id="pg_463"/>was not easy but it was
                            “beautiful”. He recalled the frequent censure motions his party had
                            defeated in the 1965/71 and 1975/78 periods. Demirel stressed, however,
                            that he would welcome early elections since he felt in a strong
                            political position.</p>

                            debt rescheduling negotiations to reschedule payments on Turkey’s
                            previously rescheduled debts falling due during the 18 month period,
                            July 1, 1980–December 31, 1981. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MGW_1"
                                >Miller</persName> concurs in this recommendation.</p>
                        <p>Our economic analysis for the next six months of this 18 month period
                            indicates that the Turks might be able to service their debt payments,
                            although they have said they will not be in a position to pay because
                            they need the foreign exchange for critical imports. For calendar 1981
                            our analysis indicates that there is a high probability that Turkey will
                            not be able to service its debt payments unless previously rescheduled
                            debt is included in the debt relief agreement under negotiation. These
                            negotiations broke off June 19 over this issue.</p>

                        <p>The Turkish government believes that the $457 million in debt relief
                            resulting from rescheduling previously rescheduled debt over the next 18
                            months is critical to the successful continuation of their economic
                            stabilization program. They see the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            position as pivotal in the negotiations. Our European allies
                            (particularly the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss>) are willing to
                            go along with the Turkish request if we do. The Turks see this issue in
                            political terms, noting our “best effort” commitment of assistance under
                            the recently signed <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Turkey Defense
                            and Economic Cooperation Agreement. Rescheduling previously rescheduled
                            debt was the only substantive request made of me by Prime Minister
                            Demirel. Our refusal to change our position on this critical issue
                            affecting the Turkish economy and political stability will inevitably
                            make it more difficult for us to work with the Demirel government
                            effectively to get movement on Greek reintegration and Cyprus.<note

                                situation.” He further recommended: “The United States should
                                provide assurances that we will review Turkey’s 1981 requirements
                                next year. In addition, I am concerned that these debt rescheduling
                                proposals are proliferating. Therefore, I will send instructions to
                                the agencies that future proposals be sent to <gloss

                        <p>Negotiations between the Government of Turkey and its <gloss
                                target="#t_OECD_1">OECD</gloss> creditors broke down on June 19 over
                            the issue of including debt service payments on debt previously
                            rescheduled in 1978 and 1979 agreements. Creditor nations tabled a
                            generous package, but, due to the opposition of the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and some other creditors, these
                            payments were not included in the offer. The Germans (who have been
                            leading international efforts to assist Turkey) and the <gloss
                                target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss> supported Turkey’s request to include
                            these payments. The negotiations resume July 22.</p>
                        <p>Following the breakdown, the Turks suggested a compromise to break the
                            deadlock by reducing their request for a three-year rescheduling of
                            previously rescheduled debt to eighteen months, July 1, 1980 through
                            December 31, 1981. The Turks insist that without this relief, Turkey
                            will be forced to default on its public and private debts, which would
                            violate the terms of its stabilization program with the <gloss

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Economic Analysis of the Turkish Compromise</p>
                        <p>Our comments on the merits of providing 18 months of additional debt
                            relief follow:</p>
                        <p>—The economic justification for additional relief during the first 6
                            months is uncertain: the Turkish figures support their request, while
                            the creditor figures seem to demonstrate no additional relief is
                            essential.</p>
                        <p>—On the other hand, for the remaining 12 months an economic justification
                            can be made that the Turks will face imminent default.</p>
                        <p>The present creditor offer would provide debt service relief of $1.1
                            billion in 1980, but only $510 million in 1981 and $500 million in 1982.
                            Combining this with other receipts, we believe that the level of
                            earnings in 1980, given our import estimate, will enable the Turks to
                            meet their nominal foreign exchange obligations with $137 million left
                            over. In 1981, however, the figures indicate that Turkey would be unable
                            to meet its obligations, heading for a financing gap of $300 million
                            (see attached table).<note n="4" xml:id="d153fn4">Attached but not

                                facs="0499" xml:id="pg_466"/>debt service would provide an
                            additional $144 million in foreign exchange in the first six months and
                            $313 million for the remaining twelve months. In 1980, this would
                            increase Turkish foreign exchange availability. In 1981, the additional
                            relief would correspond to the foreign exchange shortfall our figures
                            project.</p>
                        <p>The Turks argue that to replenish depleted stocks of oil and industrial
                            inputs needed to resume economic activity, minimum imports in 1980 will
                            exceed our estimate by at least $300 million. (Even at this higher
                            level, Turkish imports will be less than their 1978 level in real
                            terms.) They assert that all available foreign exchange, including any
                            incremental debt relief, would be used for further imports needed to
                            increase the chances of success of their reform program.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Political Considerations</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> position on the issue of
                            previously rescheduled debt is the key to ultimate agreement by the
                            creditor nations as a group. If the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            resists providing additional relief, the Turks will view our position as
                            being at variance with the “best effort” assistance commitment in the
                            recently signed <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Turkey Defense and
                            Economic Cooperation Agreement. The Turks know that a decision on
                            previously rescheduled</p>
                        <p>debt is within your power to grant and will not understand a <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> refusal to advocate a debt relief
                            package that supports the Demirel Government’s stringent economic
                            stabilization measures. These measures hold out a realistic hope of
                            economic recovery.</p>
                        <p>The vote of confidence Demirel received July 2 assures that he and his
                            policies will continue in power at least until the fall when Parliament
                            reconvenes. The economic aid the <gloss target="#t_OECD_1">OECD</gloss>
                            nations have already pledged and a successful debt rescheduling should
                            allow Turkey to face this winter with added confidence. When I spoke
                            with Demirel in Ankara, he several times emphasized the importance of
                            rescheduling previously rescheduled debt and I stressed the need for

                        <p>The Administration has broad authority to negotiate debt agreements, but
                            Congressional attitudes require us to respect the latitude we now enjoy
                            to avoid direct Congressional controls over debt negotiations. However,
                            consultations with key Congressmen and Senators indicate no objections
                            to using this method to provide additional debt relief for Turkey.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Budgetary Impact</p>
                        <p>If future payments on previously rescheduled debt are included in the
                            creditor nation offer, <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> budget
                            receipts will be reduced by $10.9 million in FY’80, $54.6 million in
                                <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss>’81 and $14.2 million in <gloss
                                target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss>’82, assuming that the Turks would make
                            these payments if they were not rescheduled. With appropriations action
                            completed for 1980, the additional rescheduling will not create
                            Congressional pressures for offsetting reductions. In 1981 and early
                            1982, however, the increase in net budget outlays (by reducing receipts)
                            could generate such pressure. However, since our analysis suggests that
                            the Turks will not pay in 1981, agreement to improve the debt
                            rescheduling package merely regularizes a shortfall which I believe will
                            take place in any event.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Impact on Future Debt Rescheduling</p>
                        <p>Further rolling over these debt service payments in a new rescheduling
                            sets an undesirable precedent. The precedent will apply to further
                            negotiations with Turkey regarding payments beyond 1981, although we
                            would attempt to minimize Turkish expectations in this regard at the
                            July 22 meeting. Zaire is the only other country where the Turkey
                            precedent is likely to apply in the next few years.</p>

                        <p>2. Summary: Now that the Turkish military leadership has outlined its
                            basic rationale and purposes, we offer this preliminary perspective on
                            the September 12 takeover of the government.<note n="2" xml:id="d154fn2"

                                2100 <gloss target="#t_EDT_1">EDT</gloss> on September 11. The
                                Chief, Joint United States Military Mission for Aid to Turkey, was
                                alerted in advance of the military takeover, and was also assured
                                that the takeover did not signal any change in relations with the
                                United States and that all <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                                citizens in Turkey would be protected. (Washington National Records

                                    target="#t_FRC_1">FRC</gloss> 330–82–0217B, Box 18, Turkey 1980)
                                It was the third such intervention of the military since the
                                founding of the Turkish Republic in 1923.</note> Based on what we
                            know now and on comparisons with the interventions of 1960 and 1971, we
                            believe that the Turks plan to make fairly extensive alterations in
                            their political system.<note n="3" xml:id="d154fn3">See <ref
                                    target="#d151fn3">footnote 3, Document 151</ref>.</note> The
                            objective will be to keep Turkey democratic, secular and pro-Western.
                            The parliamentary system will be retained, but many here have urged the
                            new architects to strengthen the Presidency. Extremist politics which
                            had divided the country will be curbed. Overall, the revised system will
                            place greater emphasis on the unity of the state and workability of its
                            organs rather than on unrestricted personal liberties.</p>
                        <p>3. The major areas of continuity are Turkey’s economic system and
                            external relations. The military leaders are strongly committed to the
                            economic reform program begun earlier this year. In foreign relations,
                            all previous alignments and policies, including strong support for
                            settling the Cyprus problem, are to be continued without change.</p>
                        <p>4. The timetable for transfer of power to an elected civilian government
                            will depend on (1) progress in extinguishing terrorism, which is down
                            but by no means out; and (2) the degree of cooperation the military is
                            able to elicit from the civilian elite which heretofore was sharply <pb
                                n="469" facs="0502" xml:id="pg_469"/>divided. Given the magnitude of
                            the task the military has set for itself, the earliest anyone could
                            reasonably expect a transfer of power would be, say, one year; it
                            probably will take longer. End summary.</p>
                        <p>5. Background to the takeover: As those who have followed Turkish
                            politics know, the September 12 “takeover” or “operation” (the terms
                            Turks are using) is the third military intervention into politics since
                            the founding of the Republic in 1923. All were planned and executed in
                            conformity with <persName corresp="#p_AMK_2">Ataturk</persName>’s
                            tradition (aka “Kemalis”) which entrusts to the military the role of
                            watchdog over Turkey’s democracy. This intervention, like the previous
                            two, is viewed by most Turks as acceptable under the circumstances and
                            as an opportunity to improve the democratic system, building on the
                            experience of the past. The Turkish saying, “one mistake is worth a
                            thousand pieces of advice”, is their departure point.</p>
                        <p>6. In his September 12 speech, his subsequent pronouncements and his
                            September 16 press conference, General <persName corresp="#p_EK_1"
                                >Evren</persName> has devoted considerable attention to an analysis
                            of the country’s problems—and somewhat less on future plans. A close
                            reading, however, reveals considerable thought and a number of
                            significant guideposts for future action. The major theme running
                            through his analysis is deep concern and pessimism over the polarization
                            of Turkish society by the wholesale dissemination of extreme leftist and
                            religious ideology through the educational system and by use of
                            terrorist intimidation tactics. General <persName corresp="#p_EK_1"
                                >Evren</persName> tended to lay the blame for this at the door of
                            Turkey’s politicians, whom he accused of selfishness, negligence and
                            power-lust.</p>
                        <p>7. A second major point in <persName corresp="#p_EK_1">Evren</persName>’s
                            pronouncements is that the parliamentary system set up by the 1961
                            constitution and supporting legislation had foundered on the lack of
                            provision for self-correction. He lamented the inability of the last
                            Parliament to get together to pass security legislation which would have
                            permitted martial law authorities to go after the growing terrorist
                            threat. The same point has been made recently by many Turks and
                            outsiders. Many believe that the framers of the 1961 Constitution, in an
                            over-reaction to the strong-man rule of Menderes, completely hamstrung
                            the new system by penalizing the big parties and forcing governments to
                            rule by tenuous coalition.</p>
                        <p>8. Events leading to September 12: It is fairly clear now that planning
                            for a military takeover became serious in mid-July after terrorist acts
                            took the lives of an <gloss target="#t_MP_1">MP</gloss>, former Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_EN_2">Erim</persName> and a prominent
                            leftist labor leader. <persName corresp="#p_EK_1">Evren</persName>
                            reviewed these events and the increasing polarization of the country by
                            extremist groups, terming the violence a “covert war” which took as many
                            lives (5,000 dead, 15,000 injured) during the past two years as the main
                            battle for Turkish independence at Sakarya (March–July 1921). The
                            growing violence, he said, against the background of governmental
                            ineffectiveness and Parlia<pb n="470" facs="0503" xml:id="pg_470"
                            />mentary deadlock, gave the military no option but to take temporary
                            control of the State organs before they collapsed.</p>
                        <p>9. The Turkish military’s world view: <persName corresp="#p_EK_1"
                                >Evren</persName> also revealed that he and his colleagues were
                            greatly concerned about the danger of external involvement in the
                            growing anarchy in the country. He referred frequently to the
                            exploitation of sectarian differences and ideological divisions aimed at
                            destroying unity and leaving the country vulnerable to civil war and
                            external manipulation. As examples, he cited two recent incidents in
                            which leftists and religious “bigots” openly defied the unity of the
                            State during the playing of the national anthem, shouting religious
                            slogans or singing the “Internationale” in its place. While he did not
                            directly blame the Soviet Union, Afghanistan, or Islamic revivalism in
                            Iran and Libya, <persName corresp="#p_EK_1">Evren</persName> made it
                            clear that he and his colleagues believed that externally-directed or
                            inspired ideological factions had dangerously weakened the democratic,
                            secular foundations of the State. It is interesting to note that while
                            some of the military leaders are reported to be practicing Muslims, they
                            strongly believe in a secular political system, a cardinal Kemalist
                            principle.</p>
                        <p>10. Foreign policy: We look for little or no change in Turkey’s external
                            relations. Because of their importance, the Turkish military established
                            early-on close and smooth working relation with the <gloss
                                target="#t_MFA_1">MFA</gloss>. As a result, all pronouncements and
                            actions have been carefully coordinated with <persName corresp="#p_TI_1"
                                >Ilter Turkmen</persName>, Secretary General and Acting Head of the
                            Ministry. The Ambassador’s contacts with <persName corresp="#p_TI_1"
                                >Turkmen</persName> have been productive and reassuring regarding
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> interests and the continuation
                            of normal bilateral cooperation in the defense area.</p>
                        <p>11. Similarly, <persName corresp="#p_EK_1">Evren</persName> has strongly
                            reaffirmed Turkey’s active support for a settlement of the Cyprus
                            problem through the current intercommunal talks and its support for
                            Greek reintegration in <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>. As for
                            Turkey’s relations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>,
                            Western Europe and the Middle East, there are no surprises. As expected,
                                <persName corresp="#p_EK_1">Evren</persName> reaffirmed Turkey’s
                            close ties with <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>, relations with
                            the <gloss target="#t_EEC_1">EEC</gloss> and Council of Europe, and
                            bilateral relations with the Western democracies. He underscored efforts
                            to maintain and strengthen “friendly and brotherly” ties with the Muslim
                            Middle East. (Israel was not mentioned, but we expect no new moves
                            regarding Turkish-Israeli relations).<note n="4" xml:id="d154fn4">Turkey
                                recognized Israel in March 1949, the only major Muslim country to

                                Mission in Tel Aviv was raised to Embassy level.</note> After the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>, only the Soviet Union was
                            given special mention, the latter in the context of a neighbor and of
                            its special role in preserving world peace.</p>
                        <p>12. Internal reform: From <persName corresp="#p_EK_1">Evren</persName>’s
                            pronouncements, we are not yet sure how extensively the Constitution,
                            political parties and elections <pb n="471" facs="0504" xml:id="pg_471"
                            />laws and the State organs will be revised, but he has called for major
                            surgery in several areas. He has left no room for doubt that the
                            revisions will provide for a free, civilian-led, democratic
                            parliamentary system, which will respect basic individual rights. It is
                            likely, in view of the unworkability of the old system, that new
                            procedures for electing a President will be devised. There is also a
                            minority, but influential view in Turkey for creating a strong
                            presidential system which would permit the President to break
                            parliamentary deadlocks by, for example, calling for new elections.</p>
                        <p>13. From the strong criticism <persName corresp="#p_EK_1"
                                >Evren</persName> has levelled against the now-dissolved Parliament,
                            it is quite likely that divisive opposition tactics such as confidence
                            and censure motions will become more difficult to mount. Election
                            provisions may be changed from the present provincial party-slate to a
                            single-member constituency system, a reform that has already been
                            advocated. Small parties will probably have greater difficulty electing
                            members to Parliament. Undoubtedly, too, the present restrictions
                            against the use of radical or religious ideologies for political
                            purposes will be tightened up (witness repeated castigation of “bigotry”
                            in <persName corresp="#p_EK_1">Evren</persName>’s public
                            statements).</p>
                        <p>14. In addition, General <persName corresp="#p_EK_1">Evren</persName> has
                            called for reform of the educational system to help prevent the
                            dissemination of radical, alien ideologies, for changes in the judiciary
                            and the penal code (presumably to speed up the administration of
                            justice), and for curtailing the political activities of private
                            associations, some of which heretofore had been engaging in illegal
                            political activities, including terrorism. There are major implications
                            here for the degree of “openness” in the new system, but there is strong
                            sentiment in the country favoring limits on extremism now seen as having
                            been encouraged or at least permitted by the liberal Constitution of
                            1961. Among the values of their democratic system, <persName
                                corresp="#p_EK_1">Evren</persName> and his colleagues have indicated
                            their preference for changes tending to unify and heal the divisions of
                            the country, with somewhat less focus on personal liberties, which were
                            widely believed to have been abused. The rebalancing of these elements
                            will be among the most difficult and time-consuming tasks the new
                            leadership faces.</p>
                        <p>15. Economic policy: The new leadership has also announced that the main
                            elements of Turkey’s present economic and financial policies will be
                            preserved. In his speech and press conference, as well as in actions to
                            date, <persName corresp="#p_EK_1">Evren</persName> has reassured those
                            who may have wondered about the country’s continuing commitment to the
                            economic reform program instituted in February 1980, and subsequent
                            agreements with the <gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss> and the <gloss
                                target="#t_OECD_1">OECD</gloss> governments providing balance of
                            payments support. <persName corresp="#p_EK_1">Evren</persName> has
                            stated that the economic stabilization program will continue to be
                            implemented. He has asked <persName corresp="#p_OT_1">Turgut

                        </p>
                        <p>16. Timetable for return to civilian government: The strongest thread
                            running throughout General <persName corresp="#p_EK_1"
                            >Evren</persName>’s pronouncements is the commitment of the military
                            establishment to democracy. The Generals realize, of course, that
                            friends of Turkey are anxious that the transfer of power to an elected
                            civilian government occur in the shortest possible time. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_EK_1">Evren</persName> is expected to
                            establish a Cabinet shortly to handle the executive responsibilities of
                            the nation, while constitutional changes and basic laws (political
                            parties, elections) are drafted. When these arrangements are in place
                            and elections held, he promised, “all personnel of the Turkish armed
                            forces will remain outside of politics.”</p>
                        <p>17. It is still too early to venture predictions on a timetable for full
                            return of power to civilian authority. However, at this juncture it is
                            clear that: (1) neither General <persName corresp="#p_EK_1"
                                >Evren</persName> nor his colleagues have any passion to rule; and
                            (2) the extensive reforms contemplated will take time. Comparing the
                            present situation with the previous two interventions, it took about 13
                            months for the military-dominated National Unity Committee (NUC) to hand
                            over power in 1960–61. For this the NUC was strongly criticized. We
                            think it likely that General <persName corresp="#p_EK_1"
                                >Evren</persName> and his colleagues will try to avoid the delays
                            and drawn-out debates that slowed the 1960–61 process, which involved
                            the personal ambitions of a group of colonels, the trials and executions
                            of Menderes and his colleagues, and prolonged arguments over the shape
                            of the reforms.</p>
                        <p>18. The so-called coup by memorandum of 1971 offers less basis for
                            comparison, since the military did not undertake major political reform
                            and operated the government from 1971–73 through a series of “above
                            parties” coalitions and the existing parties in the Parliament. These
                            efforts, which included a heavy crackdown on the left, were temporarily
                            successful, but ultimately did not prevent a recurrence of divisive
                            politics.</p>
                        <p>19. In addition to undertaking a major reform of the political system,
                            the current military leadership will have to carry out a nationwide
                            campaign to extinguish terrorism and deal with its perpetrators. At the
                            moment, there is no evidence to suggest that this task can be carried
                            out swiftly and thoroughly enough to prevent outbreaks of resistance and
                            the recurrence of violence in the months ahead. On the contrary, we
                            think that the extreme left, which is larger, more sophisticated, better
                            organized and better armed than the radical left in 1971–73, will make a
                            major effort to discredit the interim government <pb n="473" facs="0506"
                                xml:id="pg_473"/>and to turn the people against it, possibly by
                            trying to provoke the military into “heavy handed” repression.</p>
                        <p>20. At the same time, Turkey’s civilian leaders, to whom power will be
                            returned, are certain to bargain vigorously over any proposed reforms
                            which might reduce their power. Signs of this have already appeared
                            (Ankara 6769)<note n="6" xml:id="d154fn6">Telegram 6769 from Ankara,

                            Cabinet. This bargaining is likely to continue as constitutional reform
                            begins and could extend the military’s timetable, despite the best of
                            intentions.</p>
                        <p>21. Given the potential obstacles the new leadership may have to
                            overcome, we would be wise not to guess (and that is all anyone
                            including the Turks can do at this stage) how long this whole process
                            will take. We think that American officials would be advised not to use
                            figures in conversations with outsiders. If pressed, we would have to
                            say—given the size and complexity of the task—that it could take at
                            least a year under the best conditions; but more likely a somewhat
                            longer period will be needed if the military leaders carry out the
                            extensive reform program envisioned in their pronouncements to date.</p>

                        <p>2. Since the military takeover September 12 we have taken a series of
                            actions to reassure Turkey of the continued commitment of the <gloss

                            political difficulties under which Turkey has labored for the last
                            several years and, by inference, recognized them as the causes of the
                            military action.</p>
                        <p>We affirmed in our statement that <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            assistance to Turkey will continue. Further, we immediately shared the
                            statement with all <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_OECD_1">OECD</gloss> capitals to ensure that Turkey’s
                            allies and friends clearly understood our position. We are convinced
                            that this quick action muted possible adverse public reactions in some
                            capitals. None of the official statements of the other allies have, for
                            example, any expression of conditionality with respect to future
                            assistance. The <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> also worked hard in
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> to ensure that the <gloss

                            cancelled and we supported the Turkish position with regard to the

                        <p>4. We took all of these actions rapidly, with no equivocation and without
                            preconditions. We have not however hidden in any way our general
                            concerns about seizure of power from a democratically-elected
                            government. We are encouraged by the fact that the takeover was
                            accomplished without violence and we have noted General <persName
                                corresp="#p_EK_1">Evren</persName>’s statements emphasizing the
                            primary goal of the restoration of a viable democratic government. We
                            have also noted his occasional reference to protection of human rights.
                            Statements by the military authorities supporting the Demirel/Ozal
                            economic stabilization program were well received here. The free
                            publication of the Turkish press and early free <pb n="475" facs="0508"
                                xml:id="pg_475"/>access to Turkey by international correspondents
                            were also welcome. Finally, it is clear that there is widespread popular
                            support in Turkey for many of the actions taken by the Turkish
                            military.</p>
                        <p>5. We have recognized the seriousness of the situation that has faced
                            Turkey for some time as inter alia our assistance programs give
                            testimony. The military takeover has not changed Turkey’s needs nor its
                            importance. But we will need the help of the Turkish authorities if we
                            are to be successful in obtaining widespread approval in the United
                            States for a close relationship and continued assistance programs, as
                            well as assistance from <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> and
                                <gloss target="#t_OECD_1">OECD</gloss> countries.</p>
                        <p>6. Specifically, we believe the likelihood of maintaining support for our
                            current policies in the Congress and <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> public opinion will be enhanced if the Turkish
                            military authorities would:</p>
                        <p>—outline a timetable, including specific actions phased over time, that
                            will lead to the early restoration of democracy in Turkey.</p>
                        <p>—release from custody those political leaders and others against whom
                            there is no criminal charge and reaffirm commitment to due process of
                            law for those who are detained.</p>
                        <p>—work with General <persName corresp="#p_RBW_1">Rogers</persName> so that
                            the reintegration of Greek armed forces into the <gloss

                            soon, in the next few weeks if possible.</p>

                            intercommunal talks.</p>
                        <p>7. Although we regret the suspension of democratic institutions in
                            Turkey, the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> commitment to Turkey
                            remains. We intend to ask Congress to authorize and appropriate levels

                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> assistance, Greek reintegration
                            and Cyprus. End summary.</p>
                        <p>3. After an exchange of greetings, <persName corresp="#p_TI_1"
                                >Turkmen</persName> began the conversation by reporting on the
                            foreign and domestic policy positions being taken by the new Turkish
                            authorities. He said that there will be no change in foreign policy.
                            Turkey is looking forward to continuing productive cooperation with the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and with the other <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> allies. Turkey, he said, has a
                            strong attachment to the Alliance and also to democracy. The new
                            authorities will move to restore democracy as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_TI_1">Turkmen</persName> said Turkey will be
                            looking for <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> support and
                            understanding during the coming difficult period. He stressed that the
                            economic stabilization program will continue and is showing signs of
                            success. In addition to the efforts of Turkey itself, however, he said
                            the companion requirement is for continued and increased foreign
                            assistance. He said that they are now working on aid requirements for CY
                            81 (<gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 82) and have determined that the
                                <gloss target="#t_OECD_1">OECD</gloss> countries will have to
                            provide a total of dollars 1.7 billion. They expect to get dollars 700
                            million from all donors except <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and
                                <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss>. Those two should plan to
                            provide dollars 500 million each. This should, <persName
                                corresp="#p_TI_1">Turkmen</persName> said, be in the same two-thirds
                            grant one-third loan ratio as last year.</p>
                        <pb n="477" facs="0510" xml:id="pg_477"/>
                        <p>5. On military assistance, <persName corresp="#p_TI_1">Turkmen</persName>
                            said that the needs of the Turkish military cannot be disputed in the
                            light of current international and regional developments. Turkey has, he
                            noted, transmitted a request for dollars 400 million <gloss
                                target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> in <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss>
                            82. Of this amount, 60 percent would be needed for spare parts; only 40
                            percent would be available for modernization. This, he said is a bare
                            minimum request. <persName corresp="#p_TI_1">Turkmen</persName> further
                            said that Turkey is uneasy about the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> policy of balance in military assistance between
                            Greece and Turkey. Turkey has greater needs than Greece; the amount of
                            military assistance should be considered in light of <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> defense requirements. Any ratio is
                            very artificial.</p>
                        <p>6. The Secretary responded that the restrained and supportive attitude of
                            the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> toward the new Turkish
                            Government speaks for itself. We understand the problems which gave rise
                            to the military takeover and saw that this was one option for dealing
                            with the serious problem of violence and instability in Turkey. The
                            Secretary went on to say that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            expects an early return to civilian rule and a democratic constitution.
                            In addition, he said, we are interested in the condition of the former
                            civilian leaders and in what happens to them.</p>
                        <p>7. On <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> assistance to Turkey, the
                            Secretary said he tended to support significant assistance for Turkey.
                            He recalled that as a result of his meeting with former Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_EH_1">Erkmen</persName> in June, we had
                            supported a significant debt rescheduling program for Turkey.<note n="2"

                            <gloss target="#t_DAS_1">DAS</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_ERC_1">Ewing</persName> noted that it was early in
                            the assistance planning cycle for the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss>; no specific figures could be discussed yet. The
                            Secretary concurred but said the numbers mentioned by <persName
                                corresp="#p_TI_1">Turkmen</persName> were in the ballpark of our
                            planning. But he could make no commitment at this stage.</p>
                        <p>8. The Secretary then said that in discussing military assistance to
                            Turkey and Greece, he would have to be frank. This may, he said, be a
                            maximum opportunity to solve Greek reintegration and the Cyprus problem.
                            If we could resolve these problems and put them behind us, we could
                            address other aspects of our relationship in a more normal way. The
                            Secretary said he was troubled that there were indications of problems
                            in both issues that ought not to have arisen. He hoped that both sides
                            in each dispute would display a forthcoming attitude. He expressed
                            concern that if one of the two erupted into an unfortunate phase it
                            would affect <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> relations with both
                            countries involved.</p>
                        <p>9. On Greek reintegration the Secretary said it had been dragging on for
                            some time; it had properly been left to the military to solve and should
                            be solved soon. He said he was not aware of the formulas under
                            discussion and did not want to know more but he could say that a
                            solution would make it much easier to conduct relations with all
                            concerned. <pb n="478" facs="0511" xml:id="pg_478"/>He recalled he had
                            stressed this also to former Prime Minister Demirel in June.</p>
                        <p>10. The Secretary said he wanted to emphasize his concern on this point.
                            The political ramifications in the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            of a failure to achieve reintegration could complicate the aid process
                            and our whole relationship. There were already some stirrings in that
                                direction.<note n="3" xml:id="d156fn3">See <ref target="#d205"
                                    >Document 205</ref>.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_VGS_1">Vest</persName> pointed out that time is
                            running out on reintegration. If the effort in military channels is not
                            successful the matter may have to be taken up in the spotlight of the
                            political level of the Alliance.</p>
                        <p>11. <persName corresp="#p_TI_1">Turkmen</persName> said that there are
                            some good signs in the Cyprus situation. We cannot, he said, hope for an
                            early final solution but the <gloss target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> is
                            encouraging the Turkish Cypriots to the maximum extent possible to be
                            flexible.</p>
                        <p>12. On Greek reintegration, <persName corresp="#p_TI_1"
                                >Turkmen</persName> said, the Turkish military is already being
                            accused of being too lenient and making too many concessions. They have,
                            he said, taken a courageous stand, modifying earlier positions. In the
                            past, Turkey had insisted on the need to solve all problems related to
                            reintegration before reintegration actually took place. The <gloss
                                target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> is now prepared to accept
                            reintegration with no command arrangements in place. This, he said, is
                            exactly <gloss target="#t_SACEUR_1">SACEUR</gloss>’s position. The Turks
                            had been optimistic a month ago that Greece would accept this concept.
                            But now <persName corresp="#p_TI_1">Turkmen</persName> understood that
                            the Greeks were trying to give the impression that the old command
                            arrangements would be in place. The Turks have moved fast and far, he
                            said. Now the Greeks are jeopardizing a solution.</p>
                        <p>13. The Secretary said <persName corresp="#p_TI_1">Turkmen</persName> had
                            told him more about the details than he had known before. The important
                            thing, he said, was to see progress.</p>
                        <p>14. <persName corresp="#p_TI_1">Turkmen</persName> said that when he
                            returned to Ankara late in August, <gloss target="#t_MFA_1">MFA</gloss>
                            experts told him the Turkish military had gone too far in making
                            concessions on reintegration. But, he emphasized, there is a point
                            beyond which Turkey cannot go.</p>
                        <p>15. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ES_1">Elekdag</persName> said that
                            on reintegration, Turkey has done what it can do. What is needed now is
                            a little bit of understanding from the other side.</p>
                        <p>16. The meeting closed with <persName corresp="#p_TI_1"
                                >Turkmen</persName> saying that on one issue of interest to the

                            he had good news. The National Security Council would accomplish

                        <p>Dear General <persName corresp="#p_EK_1">Evren</persName>:</p>
                        <p>The profound difficulties Turkey has experienced in recent years have
                            caused deep concern in my country and among Turkey’s other friends and
                            allies. While neither my country nor any other member of <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> can fail to express concern when a
                            democratically-elected government is no longer able to govern, there was
                            considerable sympathy on our part and within the Alliance for the plight
                            in which Turkey found itself and which led to the decision of you and
                            your colleagues to assume temporarily the responsibility for governing
                            the country. Your public commitment to restore Turkey to a functioning
                            democratic <pb n="480" facs="0513" xml:id="pg_480"/>system was most
                            important in enabling us, and Turkey’s other friends, to react in a
                            constructive manner to the events of September 12.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the difficult problems which particularly challenge the
                            Turkish nation, all of us in the Alliance must respond to the grave
                            threats to our common security exemplified by Soviet aggression in
                            Afghanistan and the conflict between Iran and Iraq.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d157fn2">Iraq invaded Iran on September 22.</note> Clearly
                            we in the West should—as never before—work together to bolster our
                            collective defenses.</p>
                        <p>When we do so our record is impressive. When faced with earlier
                            challenges we successfully deterred aggression and preserved the
                            security of our own nations through effective cooperation in the
                            Atlantic Alliance. Indeed, the southeastern region of <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> has always been most secure when
                            Turkey and Greece have been effectively cooperating in the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> military structure.</p>
                        <p>For too many years this area of the Alliance has been troubled and
                            divided. Since 1977 the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> military
                            authorities, especially General <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1"
                                >Haig</persName> and now General <persName corresp="#p_RBW_1"
                                >Rogers</persName>, have been working to restore the gap in our
                            defenses by accomplishing the return of Greek forces to <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>. It is my understanding that General
                                <persName corresp="#p_RBW_1">Rogers</persName> has brought the
                            problem close to an acceptable solution.</p>
                        <p>I do not wish to interfere with the efforts of General <persName
                                corresp="#p_RBW_1">Rogers</persName>, and I am addressing this issue
                            from the standpoint of the United States. However, it is increasingly
                            clear to me that it is essential to resolve this matter now, and,
                            indeed, if a solution is longer delayed it may well become impossible.
                            That would be a tragedy for us all. I, therefore, hope that you and
                            General <persName corresp="#p_RBW_1">Rogers</persName> during his
                            impending visit to Ankara will be able to make a decisive contribution
                            to the rapid resolution of this vexing problem.<note n="3"

                                asserted that no Turkish government, including his own, could accept

                                formed a civilian government, issued and approved an action program,
                                passed some laws and settled in for its major tasks. On the agenda
                                are plans for restructuring the country’s political system, revising

                            would first like to mention two political concerns that were very
                            important to the United States:</p>
                        <p>—The desirability of getting Turkish-Greek issues settled and Greece back
                            into <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> so that Greece, Turkey and
                            the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> could all benefit from
                            restoration of normal relations; and</p>
                        <p>—The fact that we all needed Turkey’s help and input into the Iran-Iraq
                            situation, which now appeared likely to drag out into a war of

                        <p>In connection with the latter point, he asked Mr. <persName

                            efforts, whenever the opportunity presented itself, to impress upon the

                            States, its security was not jeopardized; since it had worsened this
                            relationship, its own security had been drastically un<pb n="482"

                        <p>In connection with the first point, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_OT_1"
                                >Ozal</persName> said that he agreed fully on the desirability of
                            settling issues with Greece, but he asked for understanding of the fact
                            that General <persName corresp="#p_EK_1">Evren</persName> and his
                            military could not arbitrarily take decisions without taking into
                            account their own constituency and public opinion. He recounted his
                            experience in dissuading them from appointing Feyzioglu as Prime
                            Minister to demonstrate that they are not inclined to act arbitrarily or

                                D800445–0496)</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_OT_1">Ozal</persName>
                            then went on to mention two issues of major concern to him and his
                            government:</p>
                        <p>—The need for economic help in generous quantities during the coming
                            year; and</p>
                        <p>—The urgent need for more military help to permit modernization of the
                            Turkish armed forces so that they could play a more substantial role in
                            the region. (C)</p>
                        <p>He expanded upon the first point by describing his successful
                            conversations this past week in Washington and added that he had a
                            commitment from German Finance Minister <persName corresp="#p_MH_1"
                                >Matthoefer</persName> to match the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> economic aid contribution during the coming year.
                            (C)</p>
                        <p>In connection with the second point he said that the Turkish armed forces
                            were actually in poorer condition in respect to equipment than either
                            the Iraqis or the Iranians but he was sure that they were far better
                            trained and disciplined as a result of <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss> membership. With better equipment they could be an
                            important factor for strength in the area. He added that perhaps the
                            most urgent immediate requirement was F–4’s for the Turkish Air Force.
                            (C)</p>
                        <p>He then went on to state what he described as purely personal views. He
                            believed we understood, he said, the basic commitment of the Turkish
                            people to democracy. “It has become part of our way of life in Turkey,”
                            he said, “so that we cannot do without it. But what we have had in
                            recent years has not been democracy but anarchy. We have to correct the
                            system now so that democracy can function well for a long period of
                            time. This is going to take time. We cannot move too fast. You must not
                            expect that we will return to democracy overnight. My own feeling is
                            that it may take a year or two—but we want to do it well. Our military
                            have proved that they understand the need for democracy and <pb n="483"
                                facs="0516" xml:id="pg_483"/>there is the example of their actions
                            in both 1960 and 1971. But don’t press them too much.” (C)</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> said he
                            understood. Turkey was not like Argentina. It was much more fortunate in
                            its military leadership. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_OT_1">Ozal</persName>
                            agreed. He had one final request, he said—Turkey was losing 50% of its
                            imported petroleum supply as a result of Iraq-Iran hostilities. It might
                            need our help in getting alternate supplies. He hoped we would keep this
                            in mind. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> said we
                            would see urgently what we could do. (C)</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> asked Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_OT_1">Ozal</persName> to convey his best
                            wishes to General <persName corresp="#p_EK_1">Evren</persName> and
                            recalled that he had been impressed with the general when he had visited
                            here the year before last and had enjoyed his conversation with him.
                            (C)</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> then took Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_OT_1">Ozal</persName> and Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_ES_1">Elekdag</persName> on a short tour of the White
                            House before seeing them off at the West Wing portico. (C)</p>

                            Washington Post, especially the passage on whether the allies share the
                            “same historic and strategic vision” and on the common danger created by
                            events in Afghanistan and the Persian Gulf that currently threaten
                                Europe.<note n="2" xml:id="d159fn2">Reference is to Michael Getler,

                        </p>
                        <p>Indeed, until very recently it was Central Europe that was considered the
                            powder keg and the area where East-West confrontation seemed most
                            probable. Yet, gradually, Middle East and Western Asia, have become the
                            area for East-West confrontation, as in the case for Europe between
                            1945–1955.</p>
                        <pb n="484" facs="0517" xml:id="pg_484"/>
                        <p>The developments in this area adjacent to Turkey have assumed a
                            manifestly dangerous aspect. The political and military balance in this
                            region from a number of perspectives seems to have shifted against the
                            West. The countries of the region face threats from the outside as well
                            as internally due to their socio-political structures.</p>
                        <p>Turkey, unquestionably, with its control over the avenues from the North
                            to this area, has assumed substantially greater strategic importance.
                            Few people would dispute that an economically and militarily sound
                            Turkey can become an element of peace and stability in the region. Any
                            power which may have designs on this region will have to take into
                            consideration Turkey’s strength and resilience A robust Turkey will thus
                            be able to deter such a threat without provocation. This leads me to
                            underline the importance of strengthening the local conventional
                            deterrence of Turkey for enabling her to fulfill her responsibilities
                            within the Western Alliance.</p>
                        <p>I fully support the thesis that it is to the benefit of the United States
                            and indeed the whole western world to assist Turkey economically and
                            militarily. Assistance to Turkey and its continuance at sufficient
                            levels, in my view, is the best investment for the preservation of peace
                            and security in this increasingly volatile region of the world.</p>
                        <p>These are only a few of the thoughts that I wanted to share with you in
                            this letter. Indeed, as you prepare to depart to serve your country in
                            any other role that you might choose to play in the future, it would
                            give me considerable pleasure to consult with you and seek out your
                            support on key Turkish-American issues.</p>
                        <p>When we recently visited you with Deputy Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_OT_1">Turgut Ozal</persName>, we were not able to
                            discuss within the short time frame these issues as well as the vital
                            importance of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> assistance, both
                            economic and military, to Turkey.<note n="3" xml:id="d159fn3">See <ref

                        </p>
                        <p>I am, of course, conscious of the fact that under this Administration,
                            Turkish-American relations substantially improved. We are indeed
                            grateful for the commitment of this Administration to the economic and
                            military recovery of Turkey and, you, of course, have played a singular
                            role in this development.</p>
                        <p>In view of the above, I believe, as does my government, that the aid
                            levels <pb n="485" facs="0518" xml:id="pg_485"/>for <gloss

                            recovery of Turkey but should also take into consideration some of the
                            alarming developments in our region that I previously touched upon in
                            this letter. Turkey, hurt also financially under the continuing
                            resolution of <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1980, has made known to
                            the Administration its views on the aid levels for <gloss

                        <p>1. (S-entire text).</p>
                        <p>2. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MES_1">Muskie</persName> opened the
                            meeting by expressing US appreciation for efforts made by the Turkish
                            Government to bring about Greek reintegration. The Secretary described
                            this as a “real service” which served the interests of both Greece and
                            Turkey, as well as the United States. Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_TI_1">Turkmen</persName> said that the difficulties he
                            had earlier anticipated had not arisen and the matter had gone smoothly.
                            Although not formally involved, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MES_1"
                                >Muskie</persName> had undoubtedly played an important role in these
                            events, which the Turkish Government appreciated.<note n="2"

                        <p>3. Responding to a question from the Secretary, Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_TI_1">Turkmen</persName> said that the internal
                            situation in Turkey was progressing satisfactorily. The first task of
                            the new government had been to eradicate terrorism, since this was a
                            precondition for the return to democracy. The campaign against
                            terrorists was going well, and success could be expected. Meanwhile, the
                            National Security Council had developed a step-by-step approach to a
                            restoration of democracy, and no one in Turkey doubted that such a
                            restoration would be accomplished. One present problem was pressure from
                            various European groups and Parliamentarians, including the Council of
                            Europe and the <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss>. This pressure could
                            be expected to build, peaking with the Council of Europe sessions in
                            April and May. But there was a chance that developments in Turkey
                            meanwhile could do something to alleviate the pressure. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MES_1">Muskie</persName> said that the United
                            States was aware of the commitment to democracy of the Turkish military.
                            But it was understandable that there would be outside pressure for a
                            return to democracy.</p>
                        <p>4. Turning to the state of the Turkish economy, <persName
                                corresp="#p_TI_1">Turkmen</persName> said much would depend on oil
                            prices and supplies which in turn depend on the Iran-Iraq War. The
                            Iraqis had resumed pumping, but at reduced levels which were less than
                            what Turkish experts believed possible. To meet the expected shortfalls,
                            the Turks had contacted other producers, notably the Saudis, but
                            negotiations with the Saudis had not started. There had also been
                            contacts with the <gloss target="#t_IEA_1">IEA</gloss>. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MES_1">Muskie</persName> noted that the <gloss
                                target="#t_IEA_1">IEA</gloss> might be able to aid Turkey through a
                            system of voluntarism, without bringing into play the complex triggering
                            mechanisms. He noted Turkey should certainly be the object of this kind
                            of voluntary effort. Given the high oil stocks, a voluntary system could
                            be effective. It would also be useful to persuade the <gloss
                                target="#t_IEA_1">IEA</gloss> to adopt ceilings so that trigger
                            mechanisms could come into effect next year.</p>
                        <p>5. The Secretary asked about the possibilities of a ceasefire in the
                            Iran-Iraq War. <persName corresp="#p_TI_1">Turkmen</persName> said that
                            there seemed no chance of this at the present and that the Iraqis were
                            digging in for the winter. Turkey had considered offering itself as
                            mediator, but had decided not to because so many potential mediators
                            were already on the scene and because apparently neither side was ready
                            for a negotiated settlement. Accordingly, Turkey was maintaining a
                            stance of strict neutrality, and thought this had gained some credit in
                            the eyes of both belligerents. The Soviet role in the conflict was
                            worrisome. The Soviets had refused arms to Iraq and were providing some
                            equipment to Iran through third parties, thus positioning themselves
                            well whatever the eventual outcome. The Turks had warned the Jordanians
                            of the dangers of collapse in Iran. But they seemed more concerned with
                            the danger of collapse in Iraq. They had told the Turks that if this
                            happened, not even the Americans could save Saudi Arabia.</p>

                        <p>6. Turning to the question of economic aid, <persName corresp="#p_TI_1"
                                >Turkmen</persName> said the Turkish balance of payments problem
                            could become very serious unless the consortium could provide 1.7
                            billion dollars.<note n="3" xml:id="d160fn3">Reference is to members of
                                the <gloss target="#t_OECD_1">OECD</gloss> Consortium to Aid
                                Turkey.</note> Of this amount, the Turks hoped the US would provide
                            500 million dollars and the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> an
                            equal amount. The situation was tight and would be very difficult if
                            that amount were not forthcoming. Meanwhile, Turkey was working to
                            control inflation, increase government revenues and reform the tax laws.
                            In addition, Turkey hoped for 400 million dollars in <gloss
                                target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> credits. Congress might be in a more
                            receptive mood to approve such amounts given the instability in
                            Southwest Asia. <persName corresp="#p_TI_1">Turkmen</persName> also
                            urged that <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> credits be
                            concessionary, since the Turkish economy would otherwise be burdened
                            with repaying 2.80 dollars for every dollar of <gloss target="#t_FMS_1"
                                >FMS</gloss> credit extended. The Secretary said he had just made
                            the assistance budget request to the President, but the President would
                            have to find sufficient room in the budget for the overall amounts
                            requested. Within the overall program, Turkey had a very important
                            place, and if the monies could be found, the request we had made would
                            be adequate for Turkish needs. However, there was no final decision yet,
                            and the new administration would, of course, be the determining factor
                            after January 20th.</p>
                        <p>7. In this regard, the Secretary noted that Turkish standing was
                            currently high in Congress. But he cautioned against further
                            deterioration in Turkish-Israeli relations, which could have a very
                            negative effect on congressional opinion. <persName corresp="#p_TI_1"
                                >Turkmen</persName> said the Turks had no intention of taking
                            further steps in this area.<note n="4" xml:id="d160fn4">In telegram
                                21531 from Tel Aviv, December 1, the Embassy reported that Turkey
                                was reducing its diplomatic representation in Israel, with the plan
                                to have only one accredited Turkish diplomat stationed in Israel by
                                March 1981. A Turkish official suggested that the action was related
                                to pressure from Iraq and Saudi Arabia, or what the telegram
                                described as “oil blackmail.” (National Archives, <gloss
                                    target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Foreign Policy File,
                                D800573–0430)</note> As it was, Turkey’s relations with Israel were
                            on a higher level than those of either Spain or Greece. He also noted
                            that the Turks had been under some pressure to take the diplomatic steps
                            which had been taken. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MES_1"
                                >Muskie</persName> said he understood conflicting pressures had to
                            be reconciled and the Turks and Israelis continued to have diplomatic
                            relations. What would be publicly perceived in the United States,
                            however, was not the absolute level of such relations but negative
                            changes. These could do great harm to Turkey’s standing on the Hill.</p>
                        <p>8. Responding to a question from the Secretary, <persName
                                corresp="#p_TI_1">Turkmen</persName> said that reasonable progress
                            was being made in the Cyprus talks. They had been going on for three
                            months and a <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> General Assembly debate
                            had been avoided—both hopeful signs. The Turks and Greeks were <pb
                                n="488" facs="0521" xml:id="pg_488"/>working on a plan to settle the
                            problem of Varosha, but had not yet reached the stage of drawing maps.
                            Discussion of this issue would move more smoothly if there could be a
                            relaxation of economic pressure on the Turkish community. The two things
                            go together. <persName corresp="#p_TI_1">Turkmen</persName> added that
                            the Turks had never believed Greek protestations that they had no
                            influence with Greek Cypriots; now, however, they saw these claims were
                            true because they themselves had difficulties with an increasingly
                            vocal, more powerful and intransigent Turkish population.</p>

                                establish better relations between the United States and Turkey.

                        <p>Dear General <persName corresp="#p_EK_1">Evren</persName>:</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ES_1">Elekdag</persName> has transmitted
                            to me your message of December 10. I thank you for your kind sentiments,
                            and I share your hope for the future well-being and prosperity of our
                            peoples.</p>
                        <p>As I complete my term of office, I want to express my appreciation for
                            the close relations our two nations have had in the past four years. I
                            believe deeply that, working together and with others, we have had
                            considerable success in addressing the difficult problems of the Eastern
                            Mediterranean. I take particular satisfaction from the knowledge that
                            sustained efforts in Ankara and Washington have put the Turkish-American
                            relationship back on a solid foundation. The most tangible proof is the
                            conclusion last March of the Defense and Economic Cooperation
                            Agreement.</p>
                        <p>Much work remains on our bilateral agenda, and the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> allies face major challenges in
                            Europe and on new fronts in Southwest Asia and the Persian Gulf. You
                            will have my continued support as you seek to address those issues, and
                            as you continue your important work in leading Turkey back to democratic
                            government.</p>
                        <p>Sincerely,</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AMD_1">Alexandrakis</persName> began by
                            reading the text of a communication from his government to the next
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> administration on the subject
                            of relations between Greece and <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>.
                            The message relayed the Greek Government’s intention to submit concrete
                            proposals to the alliance in mid-January that are designed to meet both
                            Greek and Allied defense needs. It expressed hope that the new <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> administration would deal with events
                            in the Eastern Mediterranean in “a balanced way”. The Greek government
                            also indicated its willingness to settle rapidly its differences with
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> and its hope that the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> will view the Greek gesture as a first
                            step, and as helping to clear the way for bilateral talks between the
                            two countries.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> replied that he was
                            very pleased to learn of the Greek intention which seemed like a
                            constructive step. He indicated deep concern with the present situation
                            in the Eastern Mediterranean and an interest in trying to help resolve
                            the problems there. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>
                            said that he would become involved in these issues himself after January
                            20.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AMD_1">Alexandrakis</persName> responded
                            that the Greek government was encouraged by the election of Governor
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> and the nomination of
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>. He added that the
                            five points that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> had proposed at the last <gloss

                            agreement had not satisfied Archbishop <persName corresp="#p_M3_1"
                                >Makarios</persName> who had found them vague and inadequate.<note

                                corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>, Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_AMD_1">Alexandrakis</persName> said that <persName
                                corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName> had made his negative reaction
                            to the five points public. He urged the new <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> administration not to pursue these five points since
                                <persName corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName> would prefer to meet
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> in person in order to
                            discuss ways to reopen the intercommunal talks. For psychological
                            reasons, it would not be “constructive” for the <pb n="491" facs="0524"
                                xml:id="pg_491"/>new administration to begin work on the Cyprus
                            problem with the same proposals as its predecessor.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> indicated that he would
                            take Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AMD_1">Alexandrakis</persName>’
                            comments into consideration and would think about them.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AMD_1">Alexandrakis</persName> then said
                            that he was concerned that Governor <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                >Carter</persName>’s recent statements before the Senate Foreign
                            Relations Committee indicated that the next <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> government might not become involved in the Cyprus
                                problem.<note n="3" xml:id="d162fn3">Reference is to a statement
                                made by Governor <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> on

                                administration for “tilting away” from Greece and Cyprus. No record
                                was found of <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> making a

                            “non-interference” might indicate a willingness to condone aggression.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AMD_1">Alexandrakis</persName> said
                            that he was reassured to know that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1"
                                >Vance</persName> was personally concerned with Cyprus. He looked
                            forward to an era of new relations between the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> and Greece, explaining that there is no deep
                            anti-Americanism in Greece.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> said that he hoped that
                            relations between the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and Greece
                            would be friendly and fruitful. This was especially important to him
                            because of his great personal affection and respect for the peo-ple and
                            the country of Greece. He added that Governor <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> was also personally interested
                            in bettering relations between the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            and Greece.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AMD_1">Alexandrakis</persName> expressed
                            his thanks for these statements and suggested that a visit by Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName> to the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> could help improve relations between
                            Washington and Athens.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> said that he had heard
                            excellent things about <persName corresp="#p_CC_1"
                            >Caramanlis</persName>, and knew him to be an extraordinarily able
                            leader. He and President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>
                            would very much look forward to a meeting with <persName
                                corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName> at a mutually convenient
                            time in the future. It would be difficult to set a time for a meeting
                            now but such a get-together was definitely possible in the future. Mr.

                            White House January 24.</p>
                        <p>Begin text: Dear Mr. President, your election to the high office of
                            President of the United States has raised hopes and expectations of a
                            new era in your country and in the world at large. An era in which, as
                            you have so eloquently stated, the moral values that lie at the very
                            foundation of our common civilization, will be given their rightful
                            place in dealing with problems of international life.</p>
                        <p>I believe that at this moment when you are considering the policies which
                            will translate these expectations into practice, it might be helpful if
                            I were to give you my views on Greco-Turkish differences. In this I am
                            encouraged by the interest you have shown on the subject both during
                            your campaign and after your election. I am taking this liberty in the
                            belief that an objective analysis of these differences can considerably
                            facilitate their settlement and also because I think that a constructive
                            approach of the United States of America to these issues will help them
                            to recover fully their influence in this area, to the benefit not only
                            of themselves, but also of Greece, Turkey and the Western world as a
                            whole.</p>
                        <p>In the first place, I would like to assure you, dear Mr. President, that
                            Greece seeks neither to isolate nor to weaken Turkey. On the contrary,
                            appreciating at its just value her importance to the defence of the
                            West, she wishes to see Turkey becoming a factor of stability and peace
                            in the Eastern Mediterranean. But it goes without saying that Greece can
                            not forsake her vital interests in order to satisfy unreasonable Turkish
                            demands. Neither is it in the interest of the West to seek such
                            sacrifices, which, in the last analysis, will prove counter-productive.
                            Nor is there any such need, because I am firmly convinced, that the <pb
                                n="493" facs="0526" xml:id="pg_493"/>Greco-Turkish problems can be
                            easily solved, if reason and good faith were to prevail.</p>
                        <p>Our differences with Turkey come under two headings: those that mainly
                            affect a third government but nevertheless involve Greece for historical
                            and sentimental reasons, and the strictly bilateral issues.</p>
                        <p>The question of Cyprus comes under the first heading, the problems of the
                            Aegean, under the second.</p>
                        <p>I.—The recent history of Cyprus is known to you. On July 20, 1974, Turkey
                            invaded Cyprus taking advantage of the Colonels’ coup against Archbishop
                                <persName corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName> and claiming that
                            the purpose of her intervention was to restore legality. However,
                            legality was restored three days later in the person of Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CG_2">Clerides</persName>, in Cyprus and, in Greece,
                            through my return. Thus, Turkey attained the avowed ends of her
                            intervention and ought to have withdrawn her troops from Cyprus.
                            Instead, three weeks later, while negotiations for a solution were under
                            way at Geneva, the Turkish troops launched a second attack, occupied 40
                            percent of the island’s territory, and created at the same time an
                            immense problem of 200,000 refugees.</p>
                        <p>Granting that there was some ground for the first invasion, there was no
                            justification whatever for the second and none was offered by Turkey.
                            The Greek side would have been perfectly entitled to request the
                            restoration of the Zurich regime, which both Greece and Turkey had
                                guaranteed.<note n="2" xml:id="d163fn2">Reference is to the 1959
                                London–Zurich Agreements, which led to the creation of an
                                independent Cyprus in August 1960. See <ref target="#d8fn3">footnote
                                    3, Document 8</ref>.</note> However, in a show of goodwill the
                            Greek side accepts the settlement of the problem on a new basis, by
                            adopting positions which can satisfy nearly all reasonable demands that
                            the Turkish side might make.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, Turkey, although aware of these positions of Archbishop
                                <persName corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName>, refuses on various
                            pretexts any substantive negotiation. She ignores a whole series of
                            United Nations resolutions in spite of the fact that she has voted for
                            them herself. Six rounds of intercommunal talks ended in failure,
                            because Turkey refuses to state what exactly she wants in Cyprus.<note
                                n="3" xml:id="d163fn3">The round of intercommunal negotiations
                                conducted under the aegis of the United Nations during this period
                                is summarized in <hi rend="italic">Yearbook of the United Nations,
                                    1976,</hi> pp. 283–303.</note> She simply sits to this date on
                            40 percent of the island’s territory and 65 percent of its natural
                            resources, while disposing only of 18 percent of the population, and
                            puts the intervening time to use in order to colonize the occupied area
                            and to generally consolidate her rule.</p>
                        <p>II.—The dispute over the Aegean adverts to the continental shelf and to
                            the airspace. Both these issues were raised by Turkey through <pb
                                n="494" facs="0527" xml:id="pg_494"/>arbitrary acts. Greece, who
                            favours the status quo as shaped by valid international treaties, could
                            have denied the existence of any problem in the Aegean. Instead, she not
                            only accepted to discuss the issues but also actively sought peaceful
                            and reasonable solutions, through internationally recognized legal
                            procedures.</p>
                        <p>In particular, with regard to the shelf, the Greek Government proposed on
                            January 27, 1975, that the two governments should jointly refer to the
                            International Court of Justice the question of the delimitation of the
                            continental shelf of the Aegean. The Greek proposal was accepted in
                            principle by Turkey on 7th February 1975. This agreement was reconfirmed
                            when I met the Turkish Prime Minister in Brussels, on 31st May 1975, as
                            shown by the joint communique issued at the end of the meeting.<note
                                n="4" xml:id="d163fn4">See <ref target="#d84fn7">footnote 7,
                                    Document 84</ref>.</note> Turkey also accepted at that meeting
                            that, subsequent to the referral of the dispute to the Court, parallel
                            negotiations be held to seek an agreed solution, which, if found, would
                            then be submitted to the Court to be invested by its high international
                            authority. The advantages offered by this procedure from an internal
                            political point of view were obvious. Furthermore, it ensured beforehand
                            that the dispute would be solved peacefully, in the event negotiations
                            failed. But this agreement was not honoured by the Turks, who at several
                            meetings of experts refused to discuss the drafting of the special
                            agreement required for jointly seizing the International Court.</p>
                        <p>Not content with going back on this agreed procedure, Turkey caused an
                            acute crisis in the Aegean, in the summer of 1975, by sending a
                            seismographic ship to explore parts of its continental shelf that Greece
                            considers as appertaining to her.<note n="5" xml:id="d163fn5">See <ref
                                    target="#d8fn10">footnote 10, Document 8</ref>.</note> This was
                            an arbitrary provocation, since Turkey ought to have respected these
                            parts of the shelf if for no other reason but because she considered
                            them herself to be disputed. In this case also, Greece put her faith in
                            peaceful procedures. She applied to the Security Council and to the
                            International Court of Justice. Furthermore, immediately after the
                            Security Council issued its resolution,<note n="6" xml:id="d163fn6">
                                <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Security Council Resolution 395
                                adopted on August 25, 1976.</note> Greece stated that she was ready
                            to comply with its recommendations.</p>
                        <p>III.—As regards the airspace, it is a matter of record that by virtue of
                            international agreements and regulations, to which Turkey is also a
                            party, Greece was entrusted with the exclusive responsibility of flight
                            control in an area over the Aegean extending to the maritime boundaries
                            of her easternmost islands.</p>
                        <p>Since August 1974, Turkey has tried to unilaterally alter this situation.
                            To this effect, she bisected the Aegean airspace by a line which <pb
                                n="495" facs="0528" xml:id="pg_495"/>coincides roughly with the
                            limits of the continental shelf she is claiming and, on August 5, 1974,
                            she issued <gloss target="#t_NOTAM_1">NOTAM</gloss> 714 requiring
                            arbitrarily all planes crossing this line to notify their position to
                            Turkish air control stations. In practice, she also attempted to assume
                            control of these flights invoking the necessity of creating a “Turkish”
                            air security zone in the Aegean. As was only natural, Greece reacted by
                            declaring the airlanes as unsafe and thus air traffic over the Aegean
                            was suspended.<note n="7" xml:id="d163fn7">The purpose of <gloss
                                    target="#t_NOTAM_1">NOTAM</gloss> 714 was to allow air traffic
                                controllers to distinguish between civil and military aircraft. In
                                response, Greece issued <gloss target="#t_NOTAM_1">NOTAM</gloss>
                                1018 stating that the Turkish notice was contrary to <gloss

                            mediate and formulated unofficial proposals, which would have resulted
                            in removal of the measures taken by each side and restoration of the
                            former legality. Greece accepted them. Turkey did not.</p>
                        <p>In spite of this attitude, the Greek Government again accepted bilateral
                            negotiations which led to agreement on all issues but one, namely the
                            exchange of information on military flights over the Aegean. Greece
                            submitted new proposals on this point, which were accepted by the
                            Turkish experts but were rejected by the Turkish Government. Thus, this
                            question also remains open because of Turkey.</p>
                        <p>In a further effort to facilitate the normalization of Greco-Turkish
                            relations, the Greek Government took a broader initiative.</p>
                        <p>On 17th April 1976, I proposed to Turkey the conclusion of an agreement
                            banning the use of force and providing for an exchange of information on
                            respective arms purchases.<note n="8" xml:id="d163fn8">

                                1)</note> The objective of this proposal was to bring about a
                            climate in the relations of the two countries which would have permitted
                            the discussion of our difference in an atmosphere free of threats and
                            pressures. Turkey again accepted my proposal in theory and rejected it
                            in practice. Reversing the logical order, she maintains that the
                            agreement banning the use of force ought to be concluded after the
                            settlement of our differences. But, of course, the conclusion of such an
                            agreement would, then, be meaningless.</p>
                        <p>IV.—Further to these problems there is also the question of the defensive
                            measures taken on some islands in the Aegean. On this, I would like to
                            stress that Greece has never by any treaty surrendered her natural right
                            of self-defence in the event her islands were threatened. In the past
                            she provided for their defence only in times of acute Greco-Turkish
                            crises. Now, as then, elementary security measures were taken only after
                            the two operations against Cyprus; after threats were <pb n="496"
                                facs="0529" xml:id="pg_496"/>voiced against them by Turkish
                            officials including Mr. Demirel; after the formation by Turkey of a
                            special Army of the Aegean and after the concentration opposite to the
                            island of the strongest landing forces in the Mediterranean.
                            Nevertheless, I stated in writing to the Turkish Prime Minister that the
                            measures taken on the islands were purely defensive and that they served
                            no offensive purposes, which would in any event be unthinkable in
                            practice.</p>
                        <p>Dear Mr. President, the problem of the Aegean is not one of exploiting
                            its natural resources, if any. One has the impression that Turkey aims
                            at unilaterally changing the status quo in the Aegean which was
                            sanctioned by international treaties and has functioned normally to this
                            date. She is trying to change it because, if her claims on the
                            continental shelf and the airspace were to be satisfied, they would
                            result in enclaving 501 Greek islands and islets with a population of
                            330,000 in a zone of exclusive economic and strategic interests of
                            Turkey. The territorial and political unity of the Greek state would
                            thus be dislocated.</p>
                        <p>I think that I have shown that Greece has proven with deeds her
                            willingness to seek peaceful and reasonable arrangements to all her
                            differences with Turkey. But Greece will never accept her sovereignty
                            over the islands to be jeopardized. Neither will she accept solutions
                            directly or indirectly undermining her territorial integrity and state
                            unity. Greece threatens no one and has no aggressive intentions against
                            anyone. But if she ever has to defend her territory, she would, without
                            hesitation, follow the imperatives of her history and honour. On this
                            point, there ought to be no doubt whatever.</p>
                        <p>Even as I am writing to you, Greece is seeking peaceful solutions through
                            talks, in accordance with the resolution of the United Nations Security
                            Council. I am convinced that these solutions are not difficult to find.
                            But, in order to reach this happy end, Turkey must show the same good
                            faith and the same peaceful intent. And she ought not to be left in the
                            slightest doubt that under no account or pretext whatsoever will she be
                            allowed to jeopardize the peace and serenity of the world. On this
                            particular point, your great country can play a decisive role.</p>
                        <p>The assurance given to us that the United States would oppose a military
                            solution to these disputes and would make a major effort to prevent such
                            a course of action will have to be strengthened and put in a more
                            concrete form.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, it is necessary to find a way of safeguarding peace in the
                            event present negotiations on the continental shelf were to fail. In
                            other words, to ensure that brute force shall be barred and that the
                            peaceful option of jointly submitting the dispute to the International
                            Court for an impartial decision based only on international legality and
                            law, shall remain open.</p>

                        <p>I would like to take this opportunity, dear Mr. President, to assure you
                            of the desire of the Greek Government and of the Greek people to

                        <p>1. Last night following a dinner given by President <persName
                                corresp="#p_TK_1">Tsatsos</persName> I had the opportunity to have a

                                >Caramanlis</persName>.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> Mission. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName> began by saying he was
                            looking forward to the visit of <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clark
                                Clifford</persName> next week and asked whether I thought the
                            program being arranged for <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1"
                                >Clifford</persName> here was satisfactory. I said that I had been
                            in more or less continuous touch with Washington regarding it and that
                            the program was shaping up excellently. I said that I was sure <persName
                                corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> particularly appreciated the
                            opportunity to call on <persName corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName>
                            so soon after his arrival and the substantial amount of time that had
                            been set aside for both a private meeting and lunch with the Prime
                            Minister the next day.<note n="2" xml:id="d164fn2">The meeting between

                            <persName corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName> inquired as to how far
                            I thought <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> would be
                            prepared and authorized to go in speaking for President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> and the new administration, and
                            I said I <pb n="498" facs="0531" xml:id="pg_498"/>did not know at this
                            stage but assumed that he was coming primarily to consult with the
                            authorities in the three countries concerned and to learn their views
                            and report them back to the President. <persName corresp="#p_CC_1"
                                >Caramanlis</persName> said he was prepared to present his views
                            fully and completely frankly to <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1"
                                >Clifford</persName>.</p>
                        <p>3. Cyprus. I said that there was continued very deep concern in
                            Washington with the Cyprus problem and I felt sure that <persName
                                corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> would want to go into this
                            matter very thoroughly. <persName corresp="#p_CC_1"
                                >Caramanlis</persName> said that the Cyprus problem was of course
                            quite important and he would be prepared to discuss it. However, he went
                            on, it was not nearly as important as Greek-Turkish problems and the
                            Aegean. The principal difference was that the problems in Cyprus had
                            already been caused and the challenge now was basically to find a way to
                            repair as much of the damage as possible and arrive at a generally
                            agreeable settlement for the two communities to live together for the
                            future. However, there was no danger of war over Cyprus. That watershed
                            had been passed in the summer of 1974 and under his leadership the
                            Greeks had made a national decision that they would not fight Turkey
                            over Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>4. Greek-Turkish relations. However, the Aegean situation was different.
                            The potential for war was still very much there, and the disastrous
                            aftermath of Cyprus developments in the summer of 1974 would pale
                            against the calamity for us all that would result from a Greek-Turkish
                            war.</p>
                        <p>5. And such a conflict was possible, <persName corresp="#p_CC_1"
                                >Caramanlis</persName> said, and he was going to tell <persName
                                corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> so in no uncertain terms. He
                            went on. Everyone must recognize that he (<persName corresp="#p_CC_1"
                                >Caramanlis</persName>) alone and almost single-handedly, calmed the
                            Greek nation and prevented them from going to war against Turkey at the
                            time of the <hi rend="italic">Sismik</hi> researches in the Aegean this
                            past summer.<note n="3" xml:id="d164fn3">See <ref target="#d8fn10"
                                    >footnote 10, Document 8</ref>.</note> However, he had paid a
                            terrible price for this. He had “accepted” a humiliation from the Turks
                            and the Greeks would never forgive him for this. His popularity in the
                            country had declined and in the Greek armed forces questions were raised
                            about whether or not he was cowardly or strong enough to lead Greece in
                            the face of its many problems and enemies. He could never accept such a
                            provocation or humiliation from Turkey again and the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> and Greece’s other allies must realize

                        <p>5. [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] The reason he was making such a point of
                            this, <persName corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName> said, was that
                            he very much feared there would be other provocations and attempted
                            humiliations by Turkey unless the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                            and other helped to make it clear to Ankara that these would not be
                            tolerated because the overriding interests of all of us would be too
                            greatly threat<pb n="499" facs="0532" xml:id="pg_499"/>ened. In response
                            to my questioning and periodic comments, <persName corresp="#p_CC_1"
                                >Caramanlis</persName> repeated his analysis, oft stated and
                            reported in the past, of the resurgent nationalism and expansionist
                            tendencies in Turkey which, most regrettably, were being fueled and
                            fanned by leading Turkish political personalities. Moreover, he was now
                            beginning to perceive Demirel’s strategy for dealing with the Cyprus
                            problem and Greek-Turkish problems in the period between now and the
                            Turkish elections. Demirel would appear to be forthcoming on Cyprus in
                            order to improve Turkey’s international image, blunt foreign criticism,
                            and facilitate congressional passage of the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss>-Turkish <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>—thus
                            restoring a full flow of military supplies to Turkey and strengthening
                            Demirel’s position with the Turkish military. At the same time,
                                <persName corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName> said, he did not
                            believe Demirel could afford to or would make any really significant
                            concession on Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>6. As for the continental shelf and Aegean disputes, Demirel wanted a
                            “big victory”. <persName corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName>
                            flustered and lost some of his coherence in his surge of temper and
                            exasperation with the Turks as he discussed this point. He said that he
                            had reached agreement with Demirel several times on how to handle the
                            Aegean problems, going all the way back to their May 1975 meeting in
                            Brussels up to the November 1976 Bern Agreement.<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d164fn4">For the Bern Agreement, see <ref target="#d91fn7"
                                    >footnote 7, Document 91</ref>.</note> However, Demirel
                            continued to renege on these agreements and understandings. For example,
                            a very useful and realistic procedure had been worked out and agreed in
                            detail in Bern last November providing for the two governments to
                            analyze and negotiate a settlement of the continental shelf dispute,
                            providing for ultimate submission to the World Court—in accordance with
                            customary international practices “by civilized nations” in resolving
                            such disputes peaceably—of any points that could not be bilaterally
                            agreed. The procedure also envisaged the passage of up to 18 months of
                            time which would carry Turkey beyond its elections, which was what
                            Demirel wanted as of last November. Moreover, such a procedure provided
                            a highly desirable framework for the two governments ultimately to
                            present the settlement to their nations, since no matter how it came out
                            it would not be fully satisfactory in both countries.</p>
                        <p>7. But in London last week the Turkish delegation wanted to jettison the
                            whole arrangement. They were under instructions to proceed immediately
                            to a discussion of the substance of the problem and see if some division
                            of the Aegean and its resources could be agreed. “Don’t propose 15
                            percent for Turkey and 85 percent for Greece” the Turkish
                            representatives had said, “that would be ridiculous. Be realistic.”
                                <persName corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName> said he thought
                            that Demirel wanted him to agree that Turkey could have “30 or 40 or 50
                            percent” of the Aegean, to obtain such a <pb n="500" facs="0533"
                                xml:id="pg_500"/>Greek concurrence fairly soon, and thus have his
                            “big victory” to present to the Turkish electorate. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName> said he would never play
                            that game and added that he very much feared the Demirel government
                            would be pushing the <hi rend="italic">Sismik</hi> out into the Aegean
                            again later this winter or in the spring in another show of
                            aggressiveness and manhood. Thus, he explained his concerns and
                            apprehensions, and he said he would go into them in as much detail as
                                <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> wanted.</p>
                        <p>8. Comment: There has been no discernible change in the substance of
                                <persName corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName>’ views over the
                            recent past, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName>
                            can expect to get the full force of them along the lines we have been
                            reporting in recent months. <persName corresp="#p_CC_1"
                                >Caramanlis</persName> is an exceptionally strong
                            personality—forceful, authoritarian, autocratic, demanding, clever and
                            critical. He is also capable of and with Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> will almost certainly be
                            very, very charming at times. However, he has a large amount of
                            dammed-up resentment and bitterness based on his version of Washington
                            policies and positions over the past two and a half years, and my
                            recommendation will be that <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1"
                                >Clifford</persName> allow him to get this off his chest during
                            their long, substantive meeting and not challenge him and argue with him
                            about what happened in the past as I have so often had to do. In that
                            way we will be able to put the past behind us and move to a realistic
                            and coherent discussion of where we are right now—and where we go from
                                here.<note n="5" xml:id="d164fn5">Although no official memorandum of

                            all that is within your power to help make this a reality. I am hopeful,

                            has set the tone for a new era of close and warm relations between the

                            Cyprus is a tragedy, but not a problem that could cause war between
                            Greece and Turkey. In all, each side puts the blame on the other. The
                            President should believe him, as he would speak from an objective
                            position, as though he were a third party. How was the question created?
                            How could it be solved? The Aegean question was created by Turkey.
                            Greece asks nothing in the Aegean. Turkey asks something of Greece.
                            Greece favors the status quo that has existed for more than 60 years,
                            and is contained in an international treaty.<note n="4" xml:id="d166fn4"

                            to upset the status quo at Greek expense. But its claims are ungrounded,
                            either morally or politically. He would not give more details, but he is
                            convinced that Turkey causes the problems in the Aegean.</p>
                        <p>For a solution, he would not ask the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            to bear the burden of deciding who is right and who is wrong. He would
                            ask that the President also suggest to Turkey to begin a serious and
                            responsible dialogue, without going back on what had been agreed. In
                            this dialogue, there should be no provocation on either side, which
                            would undermine the dialogue and decisions. If at the end of the
                            dialogue and negotiations there were still points unresolved, it should
                            be referred to the International Court of Justice at The Hague for
                            arbitration, as all civilized nations do. He takes this position,
                            although he could have said to Turkey that there is nothing to talk
                            about—there is just the status quo. But he has proposed arbitration.
                            There has been no response. Perhaps the <gloss target="#t_US_1"

                            He was not asking the President to humiliate or impose on Turkey the
                            views of Greece. Instead, he was asking the President to help ensure a
                            dialogue, to avoid conflict and lead instead to a solution.</p>

                            to get Turkey to agree to sustain negotiations on the Aegean. A
                            situation of spasmodic meetings sets back progress. The submission of
                            claims to the World Court may not be productive. He thought that direct
                            negotiations may be more productive.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">The Prime Minister</hi> replied that there is no doubt
                            that it is best to have direct contact and negotiations. But if there
                            are no results, then that is why we have international institutions and
                            courts. He could give an example to show how tough it is to deal with
                            Turkey. When Turkey started the Aegean problem, he suggested that they
                            go to The Hague. They accepted, but <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                >Ecevit</persName> criticized Demirel, who then backed off. Earlier,
                            he had proposed the signing of a non-aggression and arms control pact.
                            The Turks said yes. One week later he had sent a draft; the Turks
                            refused to accept it, and asked him not to reveal the fact, since that
                            would blow up everything. Two years ago he saw Demirel in Brussels. They
                            agreed to refer the problem to the World Court, and to negotiate in
                            parallel and refer the results to the Court if it worked (i.e., to put
                            the deliberations within a new political context). Demirel agreed that
                            the political approach was best for a Court agreement, not just on its
                            own. They put this in a joint communique and made it public. He then
                            asked Turkey to negotiate on a document to refer to the Court. But it
                            refused. Demirel claimed that he had not paid attention when he had read
                            the communique. Therefore Greece cannot sustain a dialogue under such
                            circumstances. He would like to say that the maximum he could do is to
                            suggest this approach (on negotiations?); and the minimum for the <gloss

                            <hi rend="italic">The Prime Minister</hi> replied that it was for truly
                            elementary defense reasons, and was done only after the invasion of
                            Cyprus, when Turkey took almost half of the island. There were daily
                            threats to the islands. It would have been unwise not to fortify them.
                            They had the right of self-defense. This is fundamental, and prevails
                            over other agreements. So the fortification of the islands was only
                            defensive. Also there was the invasion of Cyprus, many of them began to
                            leave. Their morale must be boosted.</p>

                        <p>The Cyprus question is more widely understood than the Aegean, and a

                            fortification. The United States offers its good services. It will try

                        <p>He hoped that Greece and Turkey will let us work without criticism. We

                            is to preserve <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>, in which we have

                            an army in Europe. We will do what we can to keep this involvement. It
                            has worked; it has kept the peace for 30 years. Greece and Turkey are
                            two important allies on the Southeastern flank of <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>. Their problems lead to great <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> concern. On Cyprus, the Greek
                            government can help by seeing that the Greek Cypriots continue a
                            forthcoming response to <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> efforts.
                            The Aegean is complex: he and <persName corresp="#p_CC_1"
                                >Caramanlis</persName> had been over it many times. The President
                            understands <persName corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName>’ interest
                            in this matter.</p>
                        <p>Turkey has the same interest, seen from its standpoint. It is not enough
                            for each side to say there is merit only in its arguments, but remain
                            frozen. There will be no result. To get a settlement in the Aegean, each
                            side must make substantial concessions. It is important that the parties
                            continue to talk. To discuss and then break off the talks is no good.
                            The <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> can make efforts to keep the
                            talks going, but if each side has a fixed position, then the problem
                            will not be solved and will just get worse.</p>
                        <p>Greek concessions would be helpful. But now both sides are so clear that
                            they are right, it is difficult to make concessions. The <gloss

                            we can, we will urge the parties.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately for <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>, these two
                            allies are in serious trouble. Some outside parties would like a weak

                            to get a settlement in the Aegean, both sides must make concessions.
                            This is difficult, but it can be done with good will.</p>

                            ago, it was either that or having a war with Turkey. In 1974, when he
                            had gone back to Greece, the army was fully mobilized, and everyone
                            wanted war. <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> took an indifferent
                            attitude. This is why Greece had to act. He had asked the North Atlantic

                            get <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> to take an interest. When

                        </list>
                        <p>In accordance with your recent directive on new commitments to foreign
                            governments, Deputy Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1"
                                >Christopher</persName> requests authority to increase the Ford
                            Administration’s offer of $700 million in military assistance to Greece
                            by $25 million in the course of on-going negotiations to conclude a
                            Defense Cooperation Agreement (<gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>).
                            The proposed increase, to be provided out of 1979 funds, consists of two
                            elements:</p>
                        <p>• $5 million grant military assistance (<gloss target="#t_MAP_1"
                                >MAP</gloss>) for an airborne intelligence package in addition to
                            $140 million previously offered.</p>
                        <p>• $20 million in foreign military sales (<gloss target="#t_FMS_1"
                                >FMS</gloss>) financing for Greek communications facilities in
                            addition to $560 million previously offered.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Airborne Intelligence Package</p>
                        <p>The proposed $5 million airborne intelligence package grew out of efforts
                            to ensure that critical <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            intelligence activities [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                                declassified</hi>] could continue. With the concurrence of the
                            negotiating team, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                                declassified</hi>] originally offered to provide the Greeks with a
                            package made up of excess equipment valued at almost $5 million. When
                            the Greeks rejected this offer, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                                declassified</hi>] agreed to contribute $5 million from available
                            funds toward a more sophisticated package. [<hi rend="italic">less than
                                1 line not declassified</hi>] now argues (1) that it cannot divert
                            $5 million from [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                                declassified</hi>] other intelligence community funds without
                            seriously compromising other <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            programs, and (2) that the $5 million should be considered a part of the
                            overall Defense Cooperation Agreement, not an intelligence community
                            activity.</p>

                        <p>We understand the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                                declassified</hi>] commitment to provide $5 million in funding was
                            made without seeking advance Presidential approval. Nevertheless,
                            because the Greeks regard the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                                declassified</hi>] offer a commitment, to disapprove the $5 million
                            now could interfere with prompt conclusion of the negotiations.</p>
                        <p>The commitment could be met, however, by directing [<hi rend="italic"
                                >less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] to reprogram $5 million for
                            the airborne intelligence package within its 1978 budget. [<hi
                                rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] has
                            considerable reprogramming capabilities and has often provided equipment
                            to allied services as part of mutual arrangements. This approach would
                            avoid a dispute with the Greeks and could be done apart from the formal
                            Defense Cooperation Agreement, which would avoid antagonizing the Turks
                            who are aware of the previous <hi rend="italic">quid pro quo</hi>

                            diligence, perseverance, and professionalism in producing a body of

                            similarly congratulatory and appreciative manner, welcomed this
                            opportunity to note the “satisfactory settlement” of all <gloss

                            departure. He said this meeting “seals” the agreement over which
                            representatives of both sides had labored long and hard during the past
                            two and one half years. Pointing toward a formal, final session and

                        <p>5. Comment: The primary purpose of this meeting was to lock the Greeks
                            into the agreements which have been reached on all the texts associated
                            with the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> and thus make it harder
                            for them to seek further <pb n="512" facs="0545" xml:id="pg_512"

                            publicly initialed. Nevertheless, we should anticipate that they will
                            want some minor changes, particularly as they translate into the Greek
                            language the agreed texts covering the recent issues addressed.
                            Hopefully, we will be able to hold any such changes to linguistic
                            alterations and avoid anything which might impact on the policy or legal
                            aspects of the issues involved.</p>

                                he stated: “The Aegean, essentially, is a bilateral dispute between
                                Greece and Turkey, which in part is due to the unusual—I must
                                admit—arrangements of geography. Greece owns territory very close to
                                the Turkish coast. This ownership is based on long-standing
                                international agreements. If that particular dispute cannot be urged
                                along on the way to settlement, then it could indeed become very

                        <p>The conversation began with a general review of the Cyprus situation.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> recalled that
                            after the events of 1967, he and a number of colleagues who had worked
                            on the Cyprus issue met and agreed that the problem had not been
                            resolved, and would soon be back in their laps if something more
                            substantive was not done.<note n="3" xml:id="d169fn3">See <ref
                                    target="#d162fn4">footnote 4, Document 162</ref>.</note> It was
                            clear that the problem would explode again, though obviously no one
                            could have predicted the crisis of 1974. <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1"
                                >Vance</persName> wondered how the Greek Foreign Minister evaluated
                            the current Cyprus situation in this interregnum period since <persName

                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BD_2">Bitsios</persName> said
                            there had been no real change in Cyprus with respect to the negotiating
                            situation. The Greek-Cypriots had announced on August 23 their readiness
                            to resume negotiations. Cypriot Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_CI_1">Christophides</persName> had repeated this
                            willingness to negotiate in the last few days. The change in presidents
                            had not altered anything and no change after February should be
                            anticipated. All of the likely candidates—<persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_CG_2"
                                >Clerides</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_PT_1"
                                >Papadopoulos</persName>—are known quantities, who will follow a
                            sensible, moderate line. The real problem remains to persuade the Turks
                            to come forward with new ideas. The Foreign Minister said he would be

                            his Turkish colleague to see if there was anything new in the Turkish

                        <p>When Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> asked if it
                            would not be useful for both Greece and Turkey to become more directly
                            involved in the negotiating process, <persName corresp="#p_BD_2"
                                >Bitsios</persName> replied negatively, saying a more active Greek
                            role was not necessary. <persName corresp="#p_BD_2">Bitsios</persName>
                            insisted the main lines of the Greek position were already on the table.
                            The Greek-Cypriots had accepted a bi-zonal solution. They were prepared
                            to accept a federation. All they asked for were territorial concessions.
                            Thus, why was there any need for Greek Government involvement?</p>
                        <p>The Secretary expressed his understanding of the Greek position, and said
                            it was his view that serious territorial and constitutional proposals
                            had to be put forward at about the same time, so as to provide a basis
                            for real negotiations. Otherwise, the same old stalemate would
                            continue.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BD_2">Bitsios</persName> said that
                            while he agreed with the Secretary’s remarks, it was important to note
                            the difference in quality between the proposals the two sides had tabled
                            in Vienna last April.<note n="6" xml:id="d169fn6">See <ref target="#d11"
                                    >Document 11</ref> and <ref target="#d38fn3">footnote 3,
                                    Document 38</ref>.</note> The Greek-Cypriot proposal on
                            territory roughly reflected the population balance on the Island. It was
                            a proposal that clearly could provide a basis for discussion and
                            bargaining. On the other hand, the Turkish proposal was so far from
                            anything like an acceptable federation as to be essentially
                            non-negotiable. When the Turkish-Cypriots submit a proposal which
                            embodies a real federation, only then will the parties be in a position
                            to move toward a meaningful negotiation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> asked what would happen
                            if the Turks revised their constitutional proposal along the lines that
                                <persName corresp="#p_BD_2">Bitsios</persName> had suggested. Would
                            the Greek Government at such a point be prepared to come in more
                            actively, and be willing to work directly with the Turks to bring about
                            a solution? <persName corresp="#p_BD_2">Bitsios</persName> did not
                            answer directly, but insisted that the Turks did not really want to
                            negotiate. If they were to whisper a serious proposal in Greek ears,
                            they would get a positive Greek response, <persName corresp="#p_BD_2"
                                >Bitsios</persName> said.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> suggested that
                            the Greeks might see a somewhat different attitude on the part of the
                            Turks in the weeks ahead. He suggested that <persName corresp="#p_BD_2"
                                >Bitsios</persName> press <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1"
                                >Caglayangil</persName> to be forthcoming, and said he would be
                            meeting with <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName> again,
                            and hoped to determine in greater detail what the Turkish Government
                            might be prepared to do. It was the Secretary’s feeling that the
                            situation in Ankara may have <pb n="515" facs="0548" xml:id="pg_515"
                            />changed since the Turkish elections. One could at least be hopeful on
                            this point.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BD_2">Bitsios</persName> said he
                            had received information that <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1"
                                >Caglayangil</persName> had, in fact, brought nothing with him from
                            Ankara. He recalled that <persName corresp="#p_JF_1">Frank
                                Judd</persName> had recently returned from Turkey discouraged about

                        <p>The Secretary said that, of course, we would all have to wait and see,
                            but that he was not pessimistic. We had seen some indications of change.
                            The Turks have told us they are prepared to discuss the Cyprus
                            situation. They volunteered no specific proposals, and we asked for
                            none, but we do feel that there is a somewhat different attitude—a
                            feeling of confidence on the part of the present government in Ankara
                            that it can carry out a policy with respect to Cyprus. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName> has at least come to New
                            York with a mandate to discuss the matter further.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Aegean</p>
                        <p>The Secretary enquired as to whether there had been any progress in
                            resolving Aegean problems. <persName corresp="#p_BD_2"
                                >Bitsios</persName> replied that these questions had been basically
                            dormant over the last three months. Greece had submitted a series of
                            proposals in June just before the Turkish elections. Turkey has never
                            replied to those proposals, nor had Turkey suggested a further round of
                            meetings. <persName corresp="#p_BD_2">Bitsios</persName> said he
                            intended to raise Aegean issues with <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1"
                                >Caglayangil</persName> when he saw him on Saturday (October 1) and
                            would listen to what the Turks had to say. <persName corresp="#p_BD_2"
                                >Bitsios</persName> conceded that regardless of what the Turks said,
                            it would now be difficult for the Athens Government to organize further
                            meetings, or negotiate Aegean questions before the November 20
                            elections.</p>
                        <p>When the Secretary asked if there was anything that the United States
                            might do to be helpful, <persName corresp="#p_BD_2">Bitsios</persName>
                            said there were two aspects of the matter where outside involvement
                            might be helpful. Both concerned procedural questions, but ones that
                            were extremely delicate, and could in themselves lead to difficulty. It
                            was because of this delicacy, said <persName corresp="#p_BD_2"
                                >Bitsios</persName>, that the Greek Government had originally
                            proposed that the entire matter be turned over to the World Court for
                            consideration. Greece had now agreed, however, to negotiate but it would
                            be helpful if outsiders could persuade Turkey (a) that matters which
                            cannot be resolved through negotiation be jointly submitted to the World
                            Court, and (b) that during this period of negotiations and adjudication

                            most helpful. <pb n="516" facs="0549" xml:id="pg_516"/>The Secretary
                            said that he would keep these points in mind as he talked to the
                            Turks.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary said he appreciated the difficulties Greece faced in
                            signing the Defense Cooperation Agreement which our two sides had
                            initialled in July. He said he assumed that signature would now have to
                            wait until after the Greek elections. Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_BD_2">Bitsios</persName> agreed, indicating that it
                            would be impossible for a further decision to be made on this matter
                            until after November 20.<note n="8" xml:id="d169fn8">The signature and

                                >Schaufele</persName>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Secretary opened the discussion of this question by indicating that
                            the Greek Government already fully understood US views. It was our
                            opinion that the Greek Government had over-reacted, and that the request
                            for Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName>’s
                            withdrawal was totally unwarranted.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BD_2">Bitsios</persName> agreed
                            that this was a difficult matter. He said that as unfortunate as the
                            incident might be for Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWE_1"
                                >Schaufele</persName> personally, the fact was that the Ambassador
                            would not be in a position to work in Athens. He simply could not do his
                            job. <persName corresp="#p_BD_2">Bitsios</persName> then recalled the
                            difficult history of US/Greek bilateral relations in the period from
                            1974–1977. He said Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_CC_1"
                                >Caramanlis</persName> had made great efforts to remedy the
                            situation and restore closer ties with the United States. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJB_1">Kubisch</persName> had also made a
                            major positive contribution to this endeavor. He was tactful, patient,
                            understanding. He had enjoyed the confidence of Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName>. The Prime Minister in turn
                            became satisfied in mid-1977 that he could go ahead with a series of
                            substantive steps aimed at improving US/Greek relations. Then came the
                                <persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName> statement. What he
                            said may not have seemed harmful or serious as viewed from an American
                            context, but it deeply wounded every Greek. It is not true, <persName
                                corresp="#p_BD_2">Bitsios</persName> insisted, that the Greek
                            Government was merely bowing to pressure from the press. The first
                            report about the <persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName>
                            statement came to the Greek Government from Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_AMD_1">Alexandrakis</persName> in Washington. This and
                            subsequent reports were considered the next day in a restricted Cabinet
                            session. The Cabinet was unanimous in its judgment that <persName
                                corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName> should not come to Greece,
                            and <persName corresp="#p_BD_2">Bitsios</persName> assured the Secretary
                            that the United States had many, many friends in that Cabinet. Summing
                            up, he said that if Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWE_1"
                                >Schaufele</persName> came to Athens, manifestations could not be
                            prevented and thus the whole process of US/Greek nor<pb n="517"
                                facs="0550" xml:id="pg_517"/>malization would be impaired. The Greek
                            Government would find this a most unfortunate development.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked if the Foreign Minister thought these sentiments
                            would persist over time, or whether in a few months feelings on this
                            matter might recede. The Foreign Minister replied that he did not think
                            there would be any change of attitudes. The Greek people, he said, have
                            a long memory.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he wished to reflect on these comments. He had wanted
                            to hear the Foreign Minister’s views directly and now that he had, he
                            thought it important to be able to consider this matter further in
                            private. Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BD_2">Bitsios</persName>
                            interrupted at this point to insist again that the Greek Government and
                            especially Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_CC_1"
                                >Caramanlis</persName> and himself were friends of the United States
                            and wanted to do everything in their power to improve US/Greek
                            relations. He also noted that <persName corresp="#p_CC_1"
                                >Caramanlis</persName> was certain to be re-elected on November 20,
                            and thus there would be a further four-year period of steadily improving
                            US-Greek relations.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he accepted these statements completely and knew that
                            Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName> and
                            Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BD_2">Bitsios</persName> were
                            sincere friends of the United States. The Secretary asked again to have
                            time to reflect on the presentation of the Greek Foreign Minister, and
                            promised to be back in touch with him on this matter in the near
                            future.</p>
                        <p>The meeting closed with Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BD_2"
                                >Bitsios</persName> asking how press questions about Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName> were to be
                            handled. It was agreed that the Foreign Minister would say that the two
                            sides had discussed the matter and that the Foreign Minister had
                            presented the views of the Greek Government on this question directly to
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>. It was further
                            agreed that questions about the US response should be referred directly
                            to the American press spokesman, who would say that the United States
                            had heard the presentation of the Greek Government and had agreed to
                            study it carefully and provide a response at a later date.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_BD_2">Bitsios</persName> in Athens in February
                            and London in May,<note n="2" xml:id="d170fn2">See <ref target="#d8"
                                    >Documents 8</ref> and <ref target="#d166">166</ref>.</note> and
                            suggested that he hoped to see <persName corresp="#p_BD_2"
                                >Bitsios</persName> again fairly soon in Greece. Greek Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_BD_2">Bitsios</persName> responded by
                            indicating that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1"
                                >Clifford</persName> was most welcome to come back to Athens, and
                            his return at an early date would signify that the Cyprus issue might
                            move off dead-center.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> said he was
                            particularly interested in talking to <persName corresp="#p_BD_2"
                                >Bitsios</persName>, to get a feel of where the present situation
                            stood. He recounted the difficulties we had all faced since the Vienna
                            meetings in April. First had come the Turkish elections, then the
                            difficult process of government formation in Ankara, and then the death
                            of <persName corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName>. All these
                            developments taken together had retarded real movement on Cyprus for
                            almost six months. However, <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1"
                                >Clifford</persName> said he now had the feeling that movement was
                            possible again. The new coalition in Ankara has expressed the desire to
                            see negotiations on Cyprus resumed, and that if the talks can be
                            restarted, this could constitute an important step forward. We certainly
                            do not think our efforts between February and October were wasted. The
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> still has an important
                            contribution to make, and there has been no diminution of US interest
                            and determination to see this problem through. President <persName

                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BD_2">Bitsios</persName> said he
                            was pleased by the statements Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1"
                                >Clifford</persName> had made. Greece welcomed continued US interest
                            and involvement, and affirmed that Cyprus was of continuing interest and
                            concern to the Greek government. <persName corresp="#p_BD_2"
                                >Bitsios</persName> also pledged all possible Greek government
                            cooperation and assistance with respect to the Cyprus problem.
                            Nonetheless, Athens remained pessimistic about the prospects for early
                            progress. <persName corresp="#p_BD_2">Bitsios</persName> said that on
                            Saturday he had had a long luncheon meeting with Turkish Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName>—the first
                            such meeting since the new Turkish coalition was formed. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName> essentially had nothing
                            new to say, and this in itself was a source of deep disappointment.
                            Instead of indicating that the Turkish government was prepared to make a
                            territorial or constitutional offer or even to discuss a settlement in
                            terms of percentage, <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName>
                            insisted that there could be nothing more than free discussion between
                            the parties at a resumed intercommunal conference. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BD_2">Bitsios</persName> said such a Turkish position
                            might have seemed fair a year ago, but it was neither new nor fair under
                            circumstances in which the Greek Cypriots had already put solid
                            territorial and constitutional proposals on the table.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BD_2">Bitsios</persName> said he reminded
                                <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName> that the
                            Greek-Cypriots had already accepted the concept of bizonality. They had
                            already accepted the need for a federation. They had acknowledged that
                            the Turkish Cypriots could hold 20 percent of the island’s territory. It
                            was now time for the Turks to say something concrete. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BD_2">Bitsios</persName> said he had explained to
                                <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName> that he was
                            making these statements, not to set preconditions for the negotiations,
                            but merely to outline the current status of those negotiations.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BD_2">Bitsios</persName> indicated that at one
                            point in their nonproductive conversation, he had asked <persName
                                corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName> if he wished to “whisper
                            something in my ear”, which could serve as a basis for a serious,
                            substantive discussion on a key Cyprus issue. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName> said that this was not the
                            way one could proceed. Sensitive discussions would have to take place at
                            the negotiating table, with give and take between the negotiators.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the constitutional issue, <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1"
                                >Caglayangil</persName> was even more negative. According to
                                <persName corresp="#p_BD_2">Bitsios</persName>, the Turkish Foreign
                            Minister spent most of his time complaining about US interest in this
                            subject and suggested that this was a matter better discussed directly
                            between the Greeks and the Turks. It was at this point that <persName
                                corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName> asked <persName
                                corresp="#p_BD_2">Bitsios</persName> if the Greeks would be willing
                            to sit at the table with the Turks for substantive discussions.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BD_2">Bitsios</persName> said his answer was
                            firmly negative claiming, as he said he had done many times in the past,
                            that these were matters for the Cypriots and not the Greek
                            government.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BD_2">Bitsios</persName> said he came away from
                            the luncheon meeting extremely discouraged. It was not a good
                            conversation—perhaps the poorest with <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1"
                                >Caglayangil</persName> in some years. As for the Aegean, <persName
                                corresp="#p_BD_2">Bitsios</persName> acknowledged <pb n="520"
                                facs="0553" xml:id="pg_520"/>that <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1"
                                >Caglayangil</persName> had praised Greece’s latest proposals, and
                            said Turkey was ready to provide a positive reply whenever talks
                            resumed. <persName corresp="#p_BD_2">Bitsios</persName> said he had told
                                <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName> that it would
                            not be possible to organize such a meeting before November 20 and
                            explained that he was not empowered to fix a date even after then.</p>
                        <p>Under questioning from Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1"
                                >Clifford</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BD_2">Bitsios</persName>
                            said that what disturbed him more than the substantive positions taken
                            by <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName> was the long list
                            of complaints about warlike articles in the Greek press and belligerent
                            statements by Greek politicians that <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1"
                                >Caglayangil</persName> cited at the beginning of the luncheon.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName> also had a
                            distorted report of the Greek Foreign Minister’s <gloss

                                corresp="#p_BD_2">Bitsios</persName>, on establishing the most
                            negative atmosphere possible.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BD_2">Bitsios</persName> said that while he was
                            extremely pessimistic following his meeting with <persName
                                corresp="#p_CIS_1">Caglayangil</persName>, he did not pass on this
                            pessimism to the Greek Cypriots in New York, and did not want to cast
                            doubt on prospects for future Cyprus negotiations. He hoped the US’ more
                            optimistic appraisal would prove accurate. He also thought the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Secretary General should take a further
                            initiative to resume the Cyprus talks, if he can obtain assurances from
                            the Turks that there will be serious negotiations. In this regard, the
                            Greek government favored completing the Cyprus debate in the General
                            Assembly as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BD_2">Bitsios</persName> said he was also certain
                            that the Cypriots were counting on a further <persName
                                corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> mission to the area. This,
                            too, was favored by the Greek government. Indeed, all responsible
                            factions in Greece wanted continued US involvement in the Cyprus
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> expressed
                            regret that the meeting between <persName corresp="#p_BD_2"
                                >Bitsios</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1"
                                >Caglayangil</persName> had not gone better, and said he hoped the
                            unhappy outcome did not portend a further worsening of Greek-Turkish
                            relations. <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> then asked
                                <persName corresp="#p_BD_2">Bitsios</persName> for his appraisal of
                            the domestic situation in Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>The response from Greek Foreign Minister was along familiar lines. He
                            said the Greek government was pleased that the Cypriots had been able to
                            maintain their unity and select an interim President. It was also
                            reassuring to Athens that all the possible candidates for the
                            presidential elections in February were committed to the goals set by
                            Archbishop <persName corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName>. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BD_2">Bitsios</persName> declined to predict who would
                            win the February elections, but said he doubted that the leftists would
                            emerge strengthened even if they supported the winning candidate.</p>
                        <pb n="521" facs="0554" xml:id="pg_521"/>
                        <p>With regard to the timing of the Greek elections, <persName
                                corresp="#p_BD_2">Bitsios</persName> said that <persName
                                corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName> had decided to hold them in
                            November, rather than have all of 1978 devoted to campaigning. Getting a
                            new government installed after November will mean Athens can then move
                            to deal more effectively with its many foreign policy problems, among
                            which he listed problems with Turkey, with the United States, with the
                            EC–9 and Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>Mention of Greek-US relations led quite naturally to a general discussion
                            of the status of the US-Greek Defense Cooperation Agreement. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BD_2">Bitsios</persName> said that the Agreement, which
                            had now been initialed, had been submitted to the Cabinet for study. The
                            Agreement could not now be signed until after the Greek elections of
                            November 20, but no decision had been made to sign it even after then.
                            The Greek Foreign Minister said it was a fact of life that the Greek
                                <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> was linked to the Turkish
                                <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>, and that the Turkish <gloss
                                target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> was in turn linked to Cyprus. This is
                            a linkage which has been established by others but it was a linkage that
                            no one could now break.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BD_2">Bitsios</persName> said there were also
                            mounting problems with respect to Greece and <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss>. The Greek government was seeking to establish a
                            satisfactory relationship with <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                            based on its desire to have its forces ready to participate with its
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> allies in case of an
                            emergency. The Turks were beginning to be negative with respect to every
                            position the Greeks adopted. This made the situation in Brussels very
                            difficult.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BD_2">Bitsios</persName> said the Greek military
                            was becoming very unhappy with this state of affairs, and if Turkish
                            negativism continues, pressure will grow in Greece to get out of <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> altogether. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BD_2">Bitsios</persName> said he had spoken directly
                            with General <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> about this
                            matter, and <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> had suggested
                            that further Greek-<gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> talks be
                            conducted at military rather than political levels in Brussels. This was
                            certainly acceptable to Greece.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BD_2">Bitsios</persName> then asked Secretary

                                >Clifford</persName>’s view, a first step to strengthen the Alliance
                            and rebuild <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>’s southeastern
                            flank.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_BD_2">Bitsios</persName> seemed somewhat upset by
                            this explanation and enquired as to the current relationship of the DCAs
                            to Cyprus. Was there not a linkage between these subjects? Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> and Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> both agreed there was such a
                            linkage, and that Turkey fully understood that the <gloss
                                target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> could not be passed before real
                            progress had been achieved on Cyprus.</p>

                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BD_2">Bitsios</persName> said he continued to be
                            puzzled as to why the Turks were not reasonable on Cyprus. They were
                            clearly the winners and all they had to do was find a way to confirm
                            their victory. Why had they been so stubborn these past three years?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> suggested that perhaps
                            they did not quite know how to act. Our impression is that they do not
                            believe the matter can be successfully resolved if negotiations are left
                            to the two Cypriot negotiators. This may explain why Turkey seems
                            interested in talking directly to the Greek government about Cyprus.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> observed that
                            a Cyprus solution will be difficult to obtain at best—perhaps impossible
                            without active Greek help.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BD_2">Bitsios</persName> assured
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> that we could
                            count on Greek assistance when the time was right. He closed the
                            conversation by noting again the great confidence the Greek-Cypriots had
                            in Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName>. This
                            confidence was shared by Greece as well, which was prepared to assist
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> in any way it
                            could in the months ahead.</p>

                            brief answer, I fear, is that not very much can be done now on the
                            narrow question. The pace of Greece reintegration is likely to depend
                            much more on a general easing of tensions over Cyprus and the Aegean.
                            Once there is progress there we could turn more directly to the <gloss

                        <p>The Greeks did not withdraw to the same extent as did France; they still
                            participate on several military committees of <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss> (much to the annoyance of the Turks who argue, not
                            without cause, that Greece continues to enjoy the benefit of <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> without bearing its share of the
                            burden). Athens submitted a paper to <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss> which in effect asks for a special relationship: the
                            central element is that Greece would not commit its forces to <gloss

                            only in dire emergencies, as determined by Athens itself. Naturally
                            Turkey will have none of that arrangement; neither will we or most of
                            the other Allies. Negotiations between <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss> and Greece continue (within an Ad Hoc Committee of the

                            addressing minor technical issues, with participants unwilling to face

                        <p>Over the past months there have been some advances. Greece agreed, for

                        <p>After the press had been escorted from the room, Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_PPA_1">Papaligouras</persName> said he wished
                            to bring to the Secretary’s attention the extremely serious matter of
                            the Defense Planning Committee communique which had been adopted on
                            December 7.<note n="2" xml:id="d172fn2">See <ref target="#d103fn3"

                                military command structure. Turkey was particularly concerned that
                                Greek reintegration would make Turkish military information
                                available to Greek authorities. (Telegram 12730 from <gloss

                                    >DPC</gloss> communiqué noted Turkey’s need to modernize its
                                forces and the responsibility of <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                    >NATO</gloss> members to provide assistance for the
                                modernization. The allies also “confirmed their view of the
                                importance of the contribution to the solidarity and vital security
                                of the entire Alliance of the early implementation of defence

                            It had already had a “seismic” effect in Greece because of its
                            pro-Turkish content. <persName corresp="#p_PPA_1"
                                >Papaligouras</persName> said that Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName> did not feel that what was
                            said in the communique was fair or justified. It came at a particularly
                            bad time since the new cabinet next week would face a vote of confidence
                            and present its program to Parliament and thus it could have an effect
                            on Greek domestic politics. <persName corresp="#p_KK_1"
                                >Karamanlis</persName> felt that the results of the November 20
                            election were in part attributable to anti-West and anti-US feelings in
                            Greece. Despite this <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName>
                            still wanted to return Greece as soon as possible to military
                            participation in <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_PPA_1">Papaligouras</persName> recalled that
                            Greece had entered into negotiations for a Defense Cooperation Agreement
                                (<gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>) with the US to
                            counter-balance the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> concluded with
                            Turkey. He noted that Greece would be better off if neither agreement
                            were implemented and that pending resolution of the Cyprus question he
                            hoped the US would not proceed with the Turkish <gloss target="#t_DCA_1"
                                >DCA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PPA_1">Papaligouras</persName> said he agreed with
                            remarks by Turkish Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1"
                                >Caglayangil</persName> earlier in the day that both Greece and
                            Turkey have responsibilities to help resolve the problems of the area
                            but he felt strongly that Turkey could do more with the Turkish Cypriots
                            than could Greece with the Greek Cypriot community. This was true
                            because Turkey is physically on Cyprus and exercises power over the
                            Turkish Cypriot representatives who were only a kind of “puppet”.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PPA_1">Papaligouras</persName> said that <persName
                                corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName> had told him that if the
                            Cyprus problem were not solved, he might ultimately feel obliged to take
                            the question of Greece’s <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                            relationship to a plebiscite. If he did so, he was afraid at this point
                            he would lose unless matters improve. <persName corresp="#p_PPA_1"
                                >Papaligouras</persName> also noted that Greece had submitted two
                            proposals to <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> in September 1976
                            (sic) and January 1977 but had received no response.</p>
                        <p>Returning to the Cyprus question, <persName corresp="#p_PPA_1"
                                >Papaligouras</persName> said that if they are not directly
                            involved, both Greece and Turkey would be in a position to exercise more
                            influence; on the other hand if they were directly <pb n="526"
                                facs="0559" xml:id="pg_526"/>involved, the Aegean and Cyprus
                            problems, while perhaps linked and inter-related, would become confused
                            and more difficult to resolve. It was therefore important to have Cyprus
                            precede settlement of the Aegean. The Turks have direct influence on
                            Cyprus while the Greeks did not. The two problems, if they were mixed
                            up, could have a bad effect on efforts to solve the Cyprus problem as
                            well as the Aegean.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PPA_1">Papaligouras</persName> repeated that an
                            extremely critical situation existed in Greece and asked for the
                            Secretary’s assistance with regard to the <gloss target="#t_NAC_1"
                                >NAC</gloss> communique. He urged that the Secretary support these
                            efforts with the Turkish Foreign Minister. The Greek Foreign Minister
                            hoped that the communique could use language similar to the December
                            1976 language on the two DCAs. The Secretary said he had not yet had an
                            opportunity to read the <gloss target="#t_DPC_1">DPC</gloss> or the
                            draft <gloss target="#t_NAC_1">NAC</gloss> communique and thus would
                            have to look into the matter before he could respond to <persName
                                corresp="#p_PPA_1">Papaligouras</persName>’ request.<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d172fn3">The issue in contention was that Greece anticipated
                                that Turkish officials would attempt to insert language in the draft

                        <p>With regard to Cyprus, the Secretary said <persName corresp="#p_CIS_1"
                                >Caglayangil</persName>’s position was that Turkish participation

                            agree. The Greek Government recognized the Government of Cyprus and was
                            not able to influence the Greek Cypriot community. He repeated that the
                            Aegean and other Greek/Turkish differences should not be mixed with
                            Cyprus.</p>

                            function as an ally. He cited the examples of the Long Term Defense
                            Program, the naval command in the Mediterranean, and the recent Display

                            said that if the Turks would come to the table with a logical
                            territorial proposal, then a settlement could quickly be reached under

                                >Caglayangil</persName> seemed to be suggesting that Greece should
                            also be involved in the Cyprus problem, but Greece could not be part of
                            any quadripartite meeting on Cyprus since that would tend to link in the
                            minds of the negotiators the Aegean and Cyprus questions.</p>
                        <pb n="527" facs="0560" xml:id="pg_527"/>
                        <p>The Secretary said he assumed that Greece wanted to see the Cyprus
                            problem settled. <persName corresp="#p_PPA_1">Papaligouras</persName>
                            agreed. The Secretary said that Turkey says that is also its objective.
                            Assuming that is in fact their desire, isn’t there a way within the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> framework to resolve the
                            matter?</p>
                        <p>The Secretary suggested that an effort be made to deal with the
                            communique problem so as to avoid making it a larger problem. He also
                            hoped that the debate during the remainder of the <gloss
                                target="#t_NAC_1">NAC</gloss> would not heighten tensions between
                            Greece and Turkey. <persName corresp="#p_PPA_1">Papaligouras</persName>
                            said that <persName corresp="#p_LJM_1">Luns</persName> had pressed for
                            moderation and he intended to not be immoderate.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PPA_1">Papaligouras</persName> suggested that the
                            serious questions of interest to Greece and the US be put aside until
                            after Parliament’s Christmas recess and then an effort be made to
                            normalize matters. But Greece essentially felt that Turkey was
                            responsible for the current difficulties.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked about the Government of Greece’s intentions regarding
                            the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Greek <gloss target="#t_DCA_1"
                                >DCA</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_PPA_1">Papaligouras</persName>
                            said they wanted to discuss the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>
                            calmly, but first look for proof that Turkey had moved toward a Cyprus
                            solution. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> asked
                            again whether the Greek Government wanted to go ahead with the <gloss
                                target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> or not. <persName corresp="#p_PPA_1"
                                >Papaligouras</persName> responded by asking what the United States
                            planned to do with the Turkish <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said the Agreement had been before Congress since January,
                            the Administration had endorsed it in principle, but Congress had not
                            yet been asked to take action. He asked again whether the Greek
                            Government was prepared to sign the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>
                            or not.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PPA_1">Papaligouras</persName> said he had not
                            expected the question to be put so bluntly. The Secretary assured him he
                            did not need an immediate answer. <persName corresp="#p_PPA_1"
                                >Papaligouras</persName> said he thought it best calmly to discuss
                            the matter later with the Secretary or the new American Ambassador in
                            Athens in an effort to find solutions, but he was not prepared to give
                            an answer at this time.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he understood that the Greek Government was not in a
                            position to take up the question of the Greek <gloss target="#t_DCA_1"
                                >DCA</gloss> at a time when an important vote was about to be taken
                            in Parliament.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PPA_1">Papaligouras</persName> said there were
                            also <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> problems, including the
                            absence of a reply to the two Greek proposals. <persName
                                corresp="#p_TV_1">Theodoropoulos</persName> pointed out that the
                            Greek-US <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> was negotiated in the
                            framework of <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> and therefore a
                            clarification of Greece’s positions within the Alliance should coincide
                            with any action on the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>. Turkey had
                            sought to push Greece to the periphery of the Alliance. He pointed out
                            that all existing US facilities in Greece were fully available to the US
                            and that the Greek Government had never tried to blackmail the US. The
                            Greek Government had therefore been surprised by the apparent decision
                            of the US Government to go ahead with both DCAs.</p>
                        <pb n="528" facs="0561" xml:id="pg_528"/>
                        <p>The Secretary said that we wanted to go ahead with both DCAs, but no
                            final decision had yet been taken. <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1"
                                >Tzounis</persName> referred to a statement on December 7 by the
                            State Department spokesman that the Turkish <gloss target="#t_DCA_1"
                                >DCA</gloss> should be considered on its own merits.<note n="4"

                        <p>After reading the statement (State 292218) the Secretary said that we
                            have endorsed but never directly linked in public statements the Turkish

                                    >USNATO</gloss>, November 17, the Department transmitted press
                                guidance regarding an alleged <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss>-Turkish deal on Cyprus. The allegation was that the

                                Turkish concessions in the Cyprus dispute. The press guidance
                                explicitly de-linked the embargo from Cyprus. (National Archives,

                            Secretary said he would like to examine the transcript carefully
                            himself.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_PPA_1">Papaligouras</persName> said he thought
                            that until now the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> had always been
                            linked with Cyprus. The Secretary said that we had never said there was
                            direct linkage and we had always used very carefully formulated
                            language.</p>
                        <p>The conversation closed with the Secretary promising to see what would be
                            possible with regard to the communique. He made no promises as to
                            language. <persName corresp="#p_PPA_1">Papaligouras</persName> repeated
                            that the Greeks were satisfied with last year’s language, although they
                            did not feel the two DCAs needed to even be mentioned since they had not
                            been discussed at the <gloss target="#t_NAC_1">NAC</gloss> meeting.</p>

                        <p>2. Begin summary. During extensive discussions with Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> January 21, Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName> made a detailed
                            presentation covering the whole range of bilateral <gloss

                            concern in the Eastern Mediterranean. <persName corresp="#p_CC_1"
                                >Caramanlis</persName> spoke along familiar lines about Cyprus,
                            Greece’s withdrawal from <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>’s
                            integrated command structure and the current state of its relations with
                            the Alliance, the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Greek <gloss

                            entry into the European Community. He said nothing startlingly new, but
                            his presentation on Greece’s relations with <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss> and its attitude towards the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1"
                                >DCA</gloss> was perhaps the clearest exposition yet of the Greek
                            position. <persName corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName> asked for
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> assistance in expediting
                            conclusion of negotiations with <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                            for an interim relationship which was a necessary framework for <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> bases in Greece and would serve as a
                            bridge for Greece’s eventual full return. <persName corresp="#p_CC_1"
                                >Caramanlis</persName> was skeptical about <persName

                        <p>3. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName> was
                            relaxed and outgoing during all these encounters and obviously enjoyed
                            the opportunity to meet with the Secretary and discuss matters of common
                            interest with him. He was confident, articulate and gave the impression
                            of a leader in full command. After thanking the Secretary for accepting
                            his invitation to stop in Athens, the Prime Minister made a general
                            presentation of his views as follow:</p>
                        <p>4. <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Greek relations. The Prime
                            Minister said he welcomed these discussions because they gave him an
                            opportunity to clarify Greek positions and, perhaps, to clear up
                            misunderstandings that may have arisen in the past between the two
                            governments. Relations, he said, were basically good despite the attacks
                            and criticism from the left. There was no hostility on the part of the
                            Greek people toward the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> but a
                            certain “bitterness” remained because the Greek people felt they had
                            been “betrayed” by a close friend and ally as a result of <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> policies with respect to the Junta and
                            especially because of events in Cyprus in 1974. Nevertheless, he
                            concluded, relations were good and actually better than they appeared to
                            be, although there was room for further improvement.</p>
                        <p>5. Cyprus. Cyprus was at the heart of all Greece’s problems, the Prime
                            Minister asserted. He had been dealing with it for 24 years and,
                            although he thought it had been settled on a reasonable basis some 20
                            years ago, in 1974 when he returned to Greece from exile he found the
                            problem facing him again. <persName corresp="#p_CC_1"
                                >Caramanlis</persName> admitted, as he has on previous occasions,
                            that the July 15 Junta coup was stupid and gave the Turks a pretext to
                            mount an invasion. However after normalcy had been restored (i.e.,
                                <persName corresp="#p_CG_2">Clerides</persName> became acting
                            President in Cyprus and <persName corresp="#p_CC_1"
                                >Caramanlis</persName> Prime Minister in Greece), instead of
                            withdrawing, the Turks mounted a second invasion during the Geneva
                            Conference. Although Greece could have asked for the return to the
                            status quo ante, it agreed to negotiate a new status on the island with
                            the Turks. Since then there has been nothing but a “dialogue of the
                            deaf”. The Turks are now saying they will be making concrete proposals.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName> said he hoped this
                            time they would be sincere, but on the basis of past experience he could
                            not be optimistic. The <gloss target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss> position was
                            clear support for the intercommunal talks under the aegis of the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Secretary General. Greece had already
                            made important concessions in accepting a bizonal, federal solution but
                            still did not know exactly what the Turks were seeking.</p>
                        <pb n="531" facs="0564" xml:id="pg_531"/>
                        <p>6. The Secretary said that in the discussions in Ankara <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> had indicated he had reached
                            agreement with <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> who would
                            put proposals on the table with respect to the territorial and
                            constitutional questions.<note n="4" xml:id="d173fn4">See <ref
                                    target="#d107">Document 107</ref>.</note> Although <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> did not go into any detail
                            regarding these proposals, he supported the principle of a federal
                            system and was opposed to any settlement that could lead to partition.
                            The Secretary indicated he was only reporting what <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> said, namely that he wanted a
                            final solution on Cyprus and that it was long overdue to remove this
                            “thorn” from relations with Greece. <persName corresp="#p_CC_1"
                                >Caramanlis</persName> reiterated his skepticism, which he said was
                            based on his long experience in dealing with the Turks on this issue.
                            Moreover, recent statements by <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                >Ecevit</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DR_1"
                                >Denktash</persName> appeared to contradict <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>’s assurances of serious
                                intentions.<note n="5" xml:id="d173fn5">The statements were reported

                        <p>7. <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_CC_1"
                                >Caramanlis</persName> explained that the crisis in Greece’s
                            relations with <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> was also an
                            outgrowth of the Cyprus crisis. Greece supported <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> but had faced a choice in August
                            1974 of either going to war (as many in Greece demanded) or taking some
                            action to defuse the situation. He had chosen the latter, and the
                            minimum he could do was withdraw from the integrated military structure.
                            There were strong popular feelings in Greece against <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> because one of its members had
                            committed aggression against Cyprus and the Alliance did not react. If a
                            solution could be found to the Cyprus problem, Greece would return to
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> immediately. However, since
                            we did not know when this would happen, the Prime Minister said, and
                            since Greece did not want to cut off all military ties, it had begun
                            negotiations with <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> for a special
                            relationship as a bridge for Greece’s eventual full return to the
                            Alliance. Greece made specific proposals to this effect a year ago, but
                            there has been no <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> response.
                            Moreover, the recent announcement of a change in the status of <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> Headquarters in Izmir was a mistake
                            because it was made at an inappropriate moment—that is, before Greece’s
                            relations with the Alliance had been clarified.<note n="6"
                                xml:id="d173fn6">See <ref target="#d171fn4">footnote 4, Document

                                corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName> went on to say he would like
                            to see the negotiations speeded up to reach agreement by this summer,
                            since matters can only become more difficult with the passage of time.
                            Although he would not want to create “impressions”, he said Greece may
                            be lost to <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> if some arrangement is
                            not made soon. With the establishment of this special relationship
                            Greece would also request the establishment of headquarters in Greece
                            similar to <pb n="532" facs="0565" xml:id="pg_532"/>those being created

                            later clarified to the notetaker that what the Greeks have in mind is

                            headquarters to be included in the special relationship package.) In
                            response to the Prime Minister’s request for help in expediting these
                            negotiations, the Secretary said he would look into the matter and get
                            back in touch with Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_PPA_1"

                                >Caramanlis</persName> argued that inclusion of aid in these
                            agreements is a mistake and said he would be happy if aid were dropped
                            from both agreements, in which case he would sign the <gloss
                                target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> without asking for anything in return.
                            Greece had shown its good faith by initialing the agreement; however,
                            since this <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> was inevitably connected
                            with the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Turkish <gloss
                                target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> (since it makes that one easier) and
                            with the question of Greece’s status in <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss>, it was not possible to finalize the agreement yet in
                            the absence of a reestablished military relationship with <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>. To provide the essential framework,
                            it would be difficult for the bases to function legitimately in a <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> context. This was an additional
                            reason for asking the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> to help in
                            connection with the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>9. The Secretary pointed out that it would not be possible in the case of
                            the Greek and Turkish <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>’s (or the
                            agreement with the Philippines) to separate out economic aspects because
                            of the negotiating background. It is entirely possible that whether the
                            administration raises the question of the Turkish <gloss
                                target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> or not, it will be raised by Congress
                            in the next few months. He understood the Republican Party had already
                            decided to raise the issue in Congress. The Secretary added that the
                            administration had endorsed the Turkish <gloss target="#t_DCA_1"
                                >DCA</gloss> in principle, indicating the ultimate decision would
                            depend on developments in the Eastern Mediterannean, which is a way of
                            saying Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>10. The Prime Minister pointed out that if Congress should approve the
                            Turkish <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss> without progress on Cyprus,
                            the result would <pb n="533" facs="0566" xml:id="pg_533"/>be a
                            deterioration in the situation which would make solution of problems in
                            the area impossible. Although he made clear he considers this to be an
                            internal <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> matter and did not want to
                            interfere, he felt he should draw our attention to the implications of
                            such a development, since the decision would affect Greece. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName> said he wanted to resolve
                            these issues in a way that would help restore the integrity of the
                            Alliance, but that he too had to be helped in this respect by Turkey and
                            the Alliance. The fact that he continued to follow a pro-West policy
                            while all these issues were still unresolved had been costly to him in
                            the recent elections. He reiterated that Greece’s allies and especially
                            Turkey should take advantage of his presence as leader of the Greek
                            Government to solve these problems because he has both the courage and
                            ability to settle them. If they are not settled while he is in power,
                            the possibility of an adventure or eventually even war could not be
                            excluded.</p>
                        <p>11. Aegean. <persName corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName> said the
                            Aegean dispute, too, had been created by the Turks who were seeking to
                            change a situation based on international treaties and agreements. He
                            reviewed in familiar terms the Greek position with respect to the
                            continental shelf and Aegean airspace disputes. His basic point was that
                            the Turks always backed away from agreements they had reached, thus
                            making progress impossible. To be constructive he had recently proposed
                            a three-point negotiating procedure for reaching a peaceful
                            settlement:</p>
                        <p>(A) Start a serious and consistent dialogue based on international law
                            and practice using precedents of other countries with similar disputes,
                            including the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and Canada;</p>
                        <p>(B) During that dialogue both sides should refrain from any provocative
                            actions which could upset the negotiations; and</p>
                        <p>(C) Agree that any problems not solved within a certain time through
                            these negotiations should be referred to the International Court of
                            Justice.</p>
                        <p>Since this is a fair procedure followed by many countries with similar
                            disputes, Turkish refusal to accept it leads to a presumption of bad
                            faith. There is a real risk of war should either side try to impose its
                            will unilaterally.</p>
                        <p>12. <persName corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName> then reviewed the
                                <hi rend="italic">Sismik</hi> operations of 1976 and noted he had
                            been able to avert a confrontation by taking the issue to the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Security Council.<note n="8"

                                    Nations, 1976,</hi> pp. 320–322.</note> He then described how
                            Turkish intransigence and backtracking had also made agreement on the
                            Aegean airspace issue impossible. The <gloss target="#t_GOT_1"
                                >GOT</gloss> has not yet responded to his three-point plan, although
                            it accepted a Greek proposal to resume continental shelf talks February
                            12.</p>
                        <pb n="534" facs="0567" xml:id="pg_534"/>
                        <p>13. <persName corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName> noted that Turkey
                            had recently raised the question of the Turkish minority in Western
                            Thrace as an issue. He cited statistics comparing the Greek population
                            in Turkey and the Turkish population in Greece at the time the Lausanne
                            Treaty was signed with present figures to show that there has been a
                            dramatic reduction in the size of the Greek population in Turkey but a
                            significant increase in the Turkish population in Greece. He presented
                            this as evidence that the Turks are trying to create another artificial
                            dispute.</p>
                        <p>14. <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>. Until now, <persName
                                corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName> said, there has been no
                            serious Turkish interlocutor with whom he could negotiate the various
                            disputes. <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> who is now in
                            charge is the one who created all of them. In 1974 <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> acted chauvinistically; it is
                            not yet clear how he will act now. Last June, however, just before
                            leaving his brief term as Prime Minister, he had instructed <persName
                                corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> to occupy Varosha, which does
                            not give much encouragement regarding his future policy. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName> thought <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> was trying to “create
                            impressions” in proposing a summit meeting with him. He does not know
                            what <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> has in mind with
                            respect to either procedure or substance. To meet without adequate
                            preparations and then find out that it is not possible to agree on how
                            the two countries can negotiate their differences would be dangerous.
                            (Later that evening at dinner <persName corresp="#p_CC_1"
                                >Caramanlis</persName> was even more skeptical about <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>’s intentions and reiterated the
                            need for adequate preparations before agreeing to a summit.)</p>
                        <p>15. The Secretary agreed on the need for preparation, pointing out that
                                <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> had told him he
                            genuinely wants a settlement on Cyprus but had not said anything to him
                            on the Aegean. He suggested that perhaps it would be worthwhile to try
                            to find out on a lower level what <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                >Ecevit</persName> has in mind on the Aegean. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName> said he was not asking
                            Greece’s friends to take a position on the Aegean; all he wants is that
                            they ask the Turks to accept his procedural proposals as a first step
                            towards meaningful negotiations. The Secretary volunteered that perhaps
                            the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>, without intervening, could be
                            helpful in this area as well.</p>

                            political—to strengthen and protect Greek democracy. He had started the

                            completed, with Greece a full member, before he ends his political

                            the Middle East situation, including the state of play following his
                            visit there. At the dinner the Secretary brought up our concern over the

                            to deliver this message to you and to pass on my highest personal

                        <p>I am pleased that a man of his stature and ability will be representing
                            the United States at a time when both our nations are trying to resolve
                            an array of worldwide problems, particularly those of the Eastern
                            Mediterranean. The restoration of democracy in Greece and the
                            strengthening of your democratic institutions since 1974 are a source of
                            satisfaction and comfort to the entire Western world. I am aware of the
                            historic role you played in this process; I know that role will continue
                            as <pb n="536" facs="0569" xml:id="pg_536"/>Greece enters the European

                        <p>We have gone far toward improving the relations between our nations the
                            last several years. This progress must continue. Only through a solid
                            US-Greek relationship, based on mutual respect and confidence, can we
                            properly meet the challenges which confront us. In this effort I pledge
                            to you my full cooperation.</p>
                        <p>From the beginning of this Administration, we have believed that, with
                            good will, sustained effort and cooperation with our friends, we could
                            achieve a just solution to the problems which have plagued the Eastern
                            Mediterranean.</p>
                        <p>Recent developments convince me that there is now renewed hope of
                            progress toward resolving the area’s problems. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> gave me a full account of his
                            talks with you in January, and I know you share our desire to press
                            ahead with resolution of these problems.<note n="3" xml:id="d174fn3">See

                            promising time. He has my full confidence and will want to work as
                            closely as possible with you on all the issues which concern us. I hope
                            you will share with the Ambassador your thoughts on how our nations can
                            best work together.</p>
                        <p>I understand the difficult decisions which lie ahead if there is to be a
                            just Cyprus settlement and a resolution of the differences between
                            Turkey and Greece. The United States is still willing to do whatever we
                            can to help. We all must redouble our efforts to seek a new situation in
                            the Eastern Mediterranean which is consistent with the desires and
                            requirements of the people of the area, and one in which we can all
                            sustain one another as friends.</p>
                        <p>In the coming months, Greece will have an increasing role to play in the
                            Eastern Mediterranean and in Europe. I am pleased to know that you will
                            be leading these efforts, at a time when statesmanship and reason will
                            be greatly needed. I will welcome your advice, and I hope that you will
                            give me your views at any time and in any manner you consider
                            appropriate.</p>

                                Ministerial meeting May 30–31. Paragraphs 12 and 13 of the final

                                Greek-Turkish tensions. Paragraph 12 reads: “The Allies noted with
                                satisfaction the meeting of the Prime Ministers of Greece and
                                Turkey. They expressed the hope that this dialogue on bilateral
                                questions will contribute to the solution of the differences between
                                the two countries.” Paragraph 13 reads: “The Allies reaffirmed the
                                importance they attach to the strengthening of cohesion and
                                solidarity especially in the South Eastern flank. They expressed the
                                hope that existing problems will be resolved, and that full
                                co-operation among members of the Alliance in all aspects of the
                                defence field would be resumed.” For the full text of the

                            talk first. The Prime Minister gave a long explanation of Greek views of
                            the Cyprus situation and other problems with Turkey which corresponded
                            to positions he has taken publicly over an extended period of time.</p>
                        <p>All of the problems which exist in the Eastern Mediterranean, the Prime
                            Minister said, were created by the Turks. “We ask nothing of Turkey;
                            Turkey asks something of us.” He emphasized that all these problems
                            could be solved by Turkish action. The moderation which he <pb n="538"
                                facs="0571" xml:id="pg_538"/>had shown, he said, was at the expense
                            of his domestic political support in Greece. On two occasions, he said,
                            he had carried his moderation to the point of taking measures to avoid
                            war with Turkey. The first occasion, he explained, was when the Turks
                            launched the second phase of their movement in Cyprus.<note n="3"

                                [Footnote in the original.]</note> Greece did not move against
                            Turkey and the result has been stalemate, with the Turks unwilling to
                            budge from the 40% of Cyprus they seized. Recent Turkish proposals for
                            negotiating on Cyprus were not worthy of serious attention, he insisted,
                            and earlier proposals for constitutional and territorial arrangements
                            could not be taken as a basis for setting up a new governmental system
                            for the whole island.<note n="4" xml:id="d175fn4">See <ref
                                    target="#d52fn2">footnote 2, Document 52</ref>.</note> The Greek
                            Cypriot side was right in rejecting them, he said, but he agreed that
                            the concept of a bizonal, federal system with limited powers for the
                            central government remained a basis for working out a solution. On
                            territory, he said, the proportion to be retained by the Turks had to be
                            brought down to something closer to their proportion of the
                            population—18%. He was willing to concede, he said, that they might
                            retain 25% of the territory of the island, but no more.</p>
                        <p>“The question of Cyprus has been linked with the question of the arms
                            embargo which is a headache for you,” the Prime Minister continued, “but
                            it is not we who have imposed the arms embargo. We accept that this is
                            an internal matter of the United States.” Nevertheless, the Prime
                            Minister went on, the lifting of the embargo would be disadvantageous
                            for both Greece and Cyprus and could have very adverse effects. He
                            mentioned some of the political problems it could cause for him in
                            Greece, encouraging the left to attack. If the Turks would simply make
                            some real concessions, the Prime Minister said, all these dire
                            consequences could be avoided: “I do not understand why we should be
                            striving to rid Turkey of the burden of the embargo since it is in her
                            power to rid herself of it.” He acknowledged that the President’s
                            assessment of this situation was probably different from his own.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister then turned to discussion of the Aegean, saying that
                            the problems in this region were also created by Turkey. “I could have
                            said to the Turks that we do not recognize the existence of an issue in
                            the Aegean. We favor the status quo which has been there for 60 years.
                            Since the Turks have raised the issue I have accepted discussion of it
                            with them.” Efforts to carry on discussions on the Aegean, the Prime
                            Minister maintained, had been continually blocked by Turkish
                            unwillingness to pursue discussions seriously. He talked of his
                            willingness to have the question of continental shelf rights in the
                                Ae<pb n="539" facs="0572" xml:id="pg_539"/>gean settled by the

                                of Justice on August 10, 1976. For its part, Turkey maintained that
                                the Court did not have jurisdiction in the matter. An <gloss

                            that there were possibilities for serious dialogue and we were
                            encouraging Turkey to engage in it. “There are differences of opinion
                            between you and me concerning the lifting of the arms embargo,” the
                            President continued. “It is a difficult question for us because we value
                            our continued friendship with Greece so highly. In all our proposals to
                            the Congress we have maintained a balance between Greece and Turkey from
                            our own perspective. But after three years of experience with the
                            embargo, we have not seen any progress. Our relations with Greece are
                            not better. Our relationship with Turkey has not improved. The
                            relationship between Greece and Turkey has not improved and the

                            has not improved. Because of this lack of progress, which seems likely
                            to continue with the arms embargo, we have proposed to the Congress that
                            the embargo be lifted. We did it with some hesitation because of the
                            concern expressed to us by Greeks.”</p>
                        <p>The President continued by saying that <gloss target="#t_PM_1">PM</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> had taken a more
                            constructive attitude than Mr. Demirel on Cyprus and that he hoped
                            meetings between Turks and Greeks in Cyprus could be sustained so that
                            some real progress could be made. <gloss target="#t_PM_1">PM</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> might be willing, he said,
                            to meet with both Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName>
                            and Mr. Denktaş. “As an early indication of willingness to resolve these
                            issues we have asked the Turks to start reducing the level of troops, to
                            open the Nicosia airport and to open the Varosha area and let 30–40,000
                            Cypriot Greeks return. I told <gloss target="#t_PM_1">PM</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> that the level of troops
                            in Cyprus was excessive and that all these actions should be taken prior
                            to agreement <pb n="540" facs="0573" xml:id="pg_540"/>between the Greek
                            and the Turkish Cypriots. I consider his proposal on Cyprus to be a
                            reasonable beginning.”</p>
                        <p>The President went on to stress that he felt that Turkish Cypriot
                            proposals on territory and constitutional structure were simply starting
                            points for discussion but that they offered good possibilities for
                            negotiation. He reiterated and summed up what he had already said, “I
                            would hope that bilateral discussions on the Aegean could begin and
                            perhaps quadrilateral discussions concerning Cyprus. I asked Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> whether he would be
                            willing to meet with <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName>
                            and Denktaş and he consulted with his advisors and said it would be
                            difficult because he would much prefer to have all four parties present
                            at the beginning. We have no preconceived attitudes in the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> about the division of Cyprus and the
                            exact form of government. We do feel that the Turkish forces should
                            withdraw and the refugees should be handled with compassion, that there
                            should be a strong and independent Cyprus—but negotiations may well take
                            some time.” He added that if the arms embargo is lifted, we do not
                            intend to upset the military balance that exists between Greece and
                            Turkey. He explained that we strongly favor a major <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> role in Cyprus discussions. The United
                            States is willing to help if all parties want help in discussions, the
                            President concluded, but we do not want to intrude against the wishes of
                            the parties themselves.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName> then
                            resumed his comment. Both Turkey and Greece agreed, he said, that the
                            Cyprus and Aegean questions should be treated separately. But the Turks
                            would rather deal with Cyprus as a Greek-Turkish issue, he declared. “I
                            have rejected this view because Cyprus is an independent and sovereign
                            state. I cannot make decisions for the Cypriots because even if I come
                            to an agreement with Turkey I do not want to have to impose this
                            agreement on Cyprus.” The Prime Minister said he had told <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> at Montreux that he would be
                            willing to give good advice to the Greek Cypriots if the Turks would
                            come up with reasonable proposals—but without this, he said, he had no
                            basis to give advice.<note n="7" xml:id="d175fn7">

                                their countries. A joint communiqué issued at the conclusion of the

                            <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName> said, they should
                            either make good proposals or no proposals at all. If they made no
                            proposals they could maintain that until the embargo was lifted, Turkey
                            would do nothing. If they made good proposals the embargo could be
                            lifted. Either way the situation would be clear. Instead they have made
                            poor proposals and insist on having the embargo lifted; this only
                                compli<pb n="541" facs="0574" xml:id="pg_541"/>cates things, he
                            said. He added that he did not consider the territorial proposals a
                            respectable starting point for serious discussions; and on Varosha, he
                            said, the Greeks estimated that only 15,000 people could be resettled at
                            best. But even if the Turkish promises were accepted, there would still
                            be 170,000 Greek Cypriot refugees. The constitutional proposals meant de
                            facto partition, which was really the Turkish aim, he maintained,
                            because constitutional impasse would soon develop if the Turkish system
                            were implemented. The Turkish “solutions”, he said, would in the end
                            create much greater problems than existed at present and America would
                            again be drawn into new troubles. Turkish proposals for troop withdrawal
                            really favored Turkey, because whether they had 30,000 or 10,000 troops,
                            they could still maintain control. If they were pressured to take a
                            large part of their troops off now, they would benefit their economy,
                            for their occupation forces on Cyprus were costing $2 billion per year
                            and were the main cause of current Turkish economic difficulties. Cyprus
                            had made Turkey bankrupt, he said, and she deserved little sympathy or
                            help for getting herself into this position. “I have told <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> and I have stated in Cyprus that
                            they will become the prisoners of Cyprus—the internal situation in
                            Turkey is very bad. A big part of this situation is due to the Cyprus
                            question.”</p>
                        <p>The President interrupted to observe that he believed the Turks
                            understood the burden the Cyprus problem caused them and were genuinely
                            looking for a way out. He did not interpret their latest proposals as
                            final or unalterable, he said, and he felt sure they were willing to
                            talk on the basis of them and negotiate seriously. He urged the Greeks
                            to consider negotiations, for “if negotiations are fruitless, then
                            Greece will at least have done all she can.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName> returned to his
                            review of the problem and said that he did not think that the Cypriots
                            were willing to take a chance on new talks; there had already been 8
                            phases of talks. The Prime Minister felt Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> felt the same way. If the
                            Turks could improve their proposals, the Greek Cypriot side might be
                            able to accept them as a basis for negotiations. Under such
                            circumstances, he said, he would be willing to advise the Greek Cypriots
                            to talk.</p>
                        <p>The President said he understood that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName> had told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1"
                                >Waldheim</persName> that he was not willing to negotiate on the
                            basis of Turkish proposals. The Prime Minister said he would discuss the
                            subject with <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> on Monday.
                            The President asked who should be party to the negotiations. Mr.

                            should be between <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> and

                            this is not acceptable to <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>.
                            I do not control <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> but
                                <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> controls Denktaş.”</p>
                        <p>“This creates a stalemate,” the President replied; “The Turks will not
                            agree that they have control of Denktaş and they probably overestimate
                            your influence with <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName>.”
                            “We must seek some way of <pb n="542" facs="0575" xml:id="pg_542"
                            />breaking the stalemate and opening up the possibility of a solution,”
                            the President insisted.</p>
                        <p>“Only <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> can break this
                            impasse,” the Prime Minister replied.</p>
                        <p>“You can help,” the President responded.</p>
                        <p>“He is the man who conquered the island,” the Prime Minister declared;
                            “he is the one who can make concessions. No other government can do it,
                            but he can. I do not want to accuse <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                >Ecevit</persName> of anything, but I am convinced that the solution
                            of all these problems is in his hands.”</p>
                        <p>The President observed that <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                            >Ecevit</persName>, like the Prime Minister and like himself, may have
                            political problems at home, but the Prime Minister countered, “I have
                            more difficulties than any of you.” He went on to discuss
                            anti-Americanism in Greece and commented on the fall in his own
                            popularity as shown in last November’s elections. If the situation
                            worsens, he said, he was not sure he could keep the situation under
                            control. Turkey might be kept in the West, he said, at the expense of
                            losing Greece. “If I suffer any further decline in my popularity, then
                            there will be only <hi rend="italic">chaos</hi>.” He went on to complain
                            that <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> talked too much and
                            generated too much tension about problems. This, he said, makes the job
                            of settling them more difficult. “The matter should be handled in a way
                            that keeps neither Greece nor Turkey from being lost. I will do my best
                            in that direction. I hope that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                >Ecevit</persName> will find the courage to discuss this with
                            me.”</p>
                        <p>The President said he wished to reiterate the intense interest of the
                            United States in its relations with Greece and in the situation in
                            Cyprus. He observed that his Administration was devoting a great deal of
                            time to the search for a solution to the differences between Greece and
                            Turkey. “Without improperly intruding ourselves, we will continue our
                            efforts to induce the Turks to make more forthcoming proposals. I would
                            like to encourage you to keep an open mind and to be as forthcoming as
                            possible. If you envision discussions on the Aegean as of major
                            importance without knowing the outcome—we think it is also important to
                            start discussions on Cyprus without knowing the outcome. Although the
                            Turkish proposal is not adequate . . . they accept this to be just a
                            first step,” the President concluded.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said he sensed that the President was drawing a
                            parallel between the Aegean and Cyprus and emphasized that he was
                            proposing arbitration as a means of finding a solution in the Aegean. He
                            felt that if this problem were solved first, the Cyprus problem could be
                            easier. He saw a political advantage for both Greece and Turkey in
                            having a neutral element involved, he declared; “not only do I accept
                            dialogue; I also propose arbitration.”</p>
                        <p>As the meeting came to an end, the President smiled and said, “I think
                            you realize that we have exactly the same amount of control over Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> that we have over
                            you.”</p>
                        <pb n="543" facs="0576" xml:id="pg_543"/>
                        <p>The Prime Minister, also smiling, replied, “You have <hi rend="italic"
                                >influence</hi> over me. If we can find correct solutions, I will do
                            exactly what you tell me.”</p>

                            responses are consistent in indicating that he does not plan any major
                            reaction to Congressional repeal of US arms limitations on Turkey. On
                            this basis, we can conclude with confidence that his answer to lifting
                            the embargo on Turkey will be largely vocal. However, if the reaction
                            within Greece proves to be stronger than we have any evidence he
                            anticipates, he might place temporary restrictions on US official
                            activities in Greece. But it is highly unlikely that he would close US
                            facilities; there is virtually no chance that he would step down from
                            the Premiership in protest.</p>

                        <p>We have much <hi rend="italic">clandestine evidence</hi> that, privately,
                                <persName corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName> is thoroughly
                            resigned to the lifting of arms restrictions on Turkey. Initially, he
                            was angry, but now he is no longer greatly concerned over the issue. He
                            is reported to believe that placing US military assistance to Turkey on
                            an annual basis, rather than on the multiyear basis provided in the
                            US-Turkish Defense Cooperation Agreement, would permit suitably close
                            Congressional oversight of Turkey’s foreign policy behavior. Clandestine
                            sources report that <persName corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName>
                            agrees that there is even a chance that the US is correct in asserting
                            that lifting the embargo would produce greater Turkish flexibility on

                                >Caramanlis</persName>’ Ultimate Reaction</p>
                        <p>In determining his reaction <persName corresp="#p_CC_1"
                                >Caramanlis</persName> will clearly be constrained by his
                            calculations of external and domestic political factors. He does not
                            want to set in motion a groundswell of antipathy toward the US that
                            could weaken Greek ties to the West. He sees Greek salvation in a closer
                            relationship with the <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> in particular
                            and with Greece’s traditional allies in general. Moreover, he does not
                            want to isolate Greece within <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> by
                            putting it at odds with other allies who are concerned at the
                            deterioration of Turkish military capability. In short, as a sincere
                            Greek patriot, he would be highly reluctant to do anything that would
                            jeopardize Greece’s position in the Western Alliance.</p>
                        <p>Of course, <persName corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName> would face
                            countervailing pressures at home. Greek emotionalism would be stirred by
                            the lifting of the embargo. <persName corresp="#p_PA_1">Andreas
                                Papandreou</persName> would step up his calls for whole-sale
                            retaliation against the US. Other opposition figures would also join in
                            the chorus, but the Center would almost certainly be more measured in
                            its appeals.</p>
                        <p>Greek army officers, on the other hand, would probably be quite
                            restrained in their reaction. Clandestine sources already indicate that
                            many officers are resigned to the lifting of the arms restrictions on
                            Turkey. One report cites a growing sentiment within the Greek military
                            that the successful procurement and modernization program since <pb
                                n="545" facs="0578" xml:id="pg_545"/>1974 (combined with concurrent
                            deterioration of Turkish forces) now put the Greek armed forces in
                            stronger position than the Turks. Greek air force officers are
                            reportedly convinced that lifting the embargo would probably have
                            minimal effect on the present balance between the two states.</p>

                            interests. He has the parliamentary backing to carry out whatever
                            response he chooses. Greek public opinion already has had much of the
                            shock taken away by the lengthy lead time from the first announcement of
                            the US Administration’s intent to future Congressional action.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName> will certainly
                            complain publicly if Congress lifts the embargo. He would probably
                            direct much of his attention to trying to calm Greek fears that the
                            country was being abandoned by its friends in the West. And he would
                            likely try to put Turkey on notice that this action required suitable
                            concessions on its part in respect to Cypriot issues.</p>
                        <p>Beyond this point, <persName corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName> is
                            unlikely to go unless he perceives far more intense reaction in Greece
                            than we have any evidence he anticipates. To head off what he considered
                            a dangerous amount of opposition to continuing close cooperation with
                            the US, he pulled Greece partly out of the military wing of <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> in 1974. This example probably
                            indicates the ultimate limit of the measures that he could be driven to
                            in the present event. On this basis, we judge that he could be brought
                            unwillingly to place some restrictions on US installations and personnel
                            in Greece. These would probably be of a temporary nature and would, most
                            likely, be designed not to damage our more important activities. He
                            would not want to take any steps that could undermine Greece’s long-term
                            relationship with the West.</p>
                        <p>As for personal gestures of protest, we doubt that he sees much scope for
                            action. <persName corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName> has long felt
                            that US policy made his own role in Greece more difficult. Yet it is not
                            in his character to resign at a time when he is convinced that the fate
                            of Greece rests on his shoulders. While he has begun to make
                            preparations against the day when he would be gone, by bringing
                                <persName corresp="#p_MK_1">Mitsotakis</persName> into the Cabinet,
                            these plans would be jeopardized by too early an exit. At the moment, to
                            leave would be to risk handing Greece over to <persName
                                corresp="#p_PA_1">Andreas Papandreou</persName>. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName> could never assent to
                            that.</p>

                        <p>1. Summary: Secretary met with Greek Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName> at latter’s request at Hotel
                            Carlyle in New York Saturday, June 3. Meeting, which lasted almost one
                            hour, covered following topics; Greece/<gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss> relations; <gloss target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss>
                            attitude toward administration proposal to repeal Turkish arms embargo;
                            Greece/Turkish relations; and Cyprus. <persName corresp="#p_KK_1"
                                >Karamanlis</persName> did most of the talking; he seemed more
                            relaxed and at ease than during his talks earlier in week in Washington.
                            Also present were Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_RG_1"
                                >Rallis</persName>; Ambassadors <persName corresp="#p_AMD_1"

                        <p>2. Secretary said he had been sorry to miss Prime Minister’s May 31
                            meeting with President, but it was necessary that he meet in New York
                            with Soviet Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1"
                                >Gromyko</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_KK_1"
                                >Karamanlis</persName> said his meeting with President had been
                            “very good”. Understanding had been shown by both sides, a good
                            atmosphere had prevailed, and he had appreciated the opportunity to
                            discuss all questions of current interest.<note n="2" xml:id="d177fn2"

                        <p>3. Greece/<gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> relations. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName> said he wanted to draw
                            Secretary’s particular attention to Turkish intentions with regard to
                                Greece/<gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> relations. He recalled
                            conversation with Secretary in Athens in January in which he had
                            described his intention to build a link or bridge to eventual full

                            <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName> said he was concerned
                            that if Turks “continue to block” current negotiations, there would be a
                            problem both for Greece and the Alliance which in his view would also
                            harm Turkey’s interests. The Greek position was that difficult political
                            issues should be left aside to resolve later; it would not be possible
                            to do so in the context of the Greek/<gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss> discussions. The Prime Minister asked the Secretary to
                            do what<pb n="547" facs="0580" xml:id="pg_547"/>ever he could to
                            convince the Turks not to create obstacles for a special relationship in

                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName> recalled that
                            Generals <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJ_1">Davos</persName> had agreed on general lines of an

                                184</ref>.</note> He said that he sincerely wanted to re-link Greece
                            to <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> and wanted to make the next
                            step to be toward full re-integration and not away from <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>, a situation which would be to the
                            detriment of <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>, Greece and Turkey.
                            The only specific problem that <persName corresp="#p_KK_1"
                                >Karamanlis</persName> cited concerned Aegean air space, a matter
                            which had been left unsolved within the Alliance even prior to 1974 and
                            should not be decided in a <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                            context. <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName> claimed that
                            the Turkish position was to settle relevant outstanding issues first
                            before the special relationship status was clarified, but he said he
                            could not do this without being subjected to even more opposition in
                            Greece. <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName> said that
                            involved also was the issue of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            bases in Greece which were connected with Greece’s role in <gloss

                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName> said that while it
                            was of no direct interest to the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>,
                            he was also concerned by recent problems created by Turkey for Greece in
                            its negotiations with the <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss>. He cited a
                            recent press conference statement by <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                >Ecevit</persName> in Brussels.<note n="5" xml:id="d177fn5">In

                            the hope that the administration would not characterize the <gloss

                            as mild or indifferent. He had sought to be moderate and respon<pb

                            had been criticized by Cypriots and by his opposition in Greece.</p>
                        <p>8. In response to above points, the Secretary said he very much
                            understood the importance of a restored Greek-<gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss> relationship. Following his January visit, the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> had been helpful in facilitating steps
                            toward re-integration; <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName>
                            confirmed this was the case. The Secretary said he was not informed on
                            specific aspects of the military-technical talks being conducted by
                            General <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> and he was not
                            aware that Turkey was “blocking” efforts to reach agreement. We thought
                            Greek return to <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> was important and
                            we would continue to do what we could to facilitate the process.</p>
                        <p>9. The Secretary said that in any future statements or congressional
                            testimony, we would take care not to portray <persName corresp="#p_KK_1"
                                >Karamanlis</persName>’ attitude as one of indifference or only mild
                            concern on the possible effects of lifting of the embargo.</p>
                        <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName> said he had not
                            wanted to become involved in the embargo question while in the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and would have preferred not to appear
                            before the <gloss target="#t_HIRC_1">HIRC</gloss> on June 2, but
                            Chairman <persName corresp="#p_ZCJ_1">Zablocki</persName> was anxious to
                            hear his views. He was concerned that solving one problem (the embargo)
                            would only create new problems. He thought the key to working out the
                            Eastern Mediterranean problems was related to efforts to find a Cyprus
                            solution, noting that such a settlement would help <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss>, and allow Greece to return to the Alliance. He would
                            have expected a more forthcoming Turkish position on Cyprus which would
                            have helped resolve these problems.</p>
                        <p>11. In response to the Secretary’s question about the May 29 <persName
                                corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName> meeting with <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>, the Prime Minister said that it
                            had been a rather formal meeting and had not gotten very far into
                                substance.<note n="7" xml:id="d177fn7">

                            to review the Montreux discussion and their respective positions. He
                            again expressed the hope that <gloss target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> would
                            accept his procedural proposal. The Secretary said he would at an
                            appropriate time mention to the Turks our hope that progress could be
                            made in resolving Turkish-Greek bilateral problems. He agreed that there
                            was a unique opportunity since both <persName corresp="#p_EB_1"
                                >Ecevit</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KK_1"
                                >Karamanlis</persName> had the political desire to move forward in
                            improving relations between Greece and Turkey. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName> said that he was not
                            concerned about the result of the <gloss target="#t_ICJ_1">ICJ</gloss>
                            or arbitration procedure, but needed to have political cover for
                            accepting a settlement. He said that principle was involved more than
                            specific substance. “There is no oil where we are squabbling”.</p>

                        <p>12. The Secretary said he had met earlier in the morning with <persName
                                corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName>, and had expressed the <gloss

                            <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> had explained his
                            problems with that. The Secretary said that we were trying to do what we
                            could to facilitate some kind of a meeting where both <persName
                                corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> could be present, but we were
                            doubtful that anything could be worked out agreeable to both. <gloss
                                target="#t_SecGen_1">SecGen</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> had separately
                            suggested a June 4 social gathering which we hoped <persName
                                corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> would carefully consider.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName> said that such a
                            gathering could be useful and that he would talk with <persName
                                corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> about it, although he
                            stressed that Greece could not assume responsibility for the Cyprus
                            negotiations. The <gloss target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss> could, however,
                            exercise influence on the substance of the Cyprus issues if the Turkish
                            side presented proposals which would allow meaningful negotiations. This
                            was not the case at present. The Secretary agreed that there must be
                            changes in the Turkish negotiating proposals, but said we were certain
                            that the Turks were prepared to be flexible and that <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> wanted to solve the problem.</p>
                        <p>13. In closing the meeting, the Secretary said he would follow up on the
                            matters discussed. He stressed again that the administration had no
                            intention of solving its Turkish problem at the expense of Greece.</p>

                            a somber tone while discussing Cyprus, among other matters, with me
                            earlier today.</p>
                        <p>2. Expressing general dissatisfaction with the mix of existing proposals

                                >Rallis</persName> said that more serious <pb n="550" facs="0583"

                            which are simply non-negotiable for both Nicosia and Athens. He later
                            sent me the critique prepared by the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1"
                                >GOC</gloss> which I now realize has been in the Department’s

                                which he announced the Greek Cypriot rejection of the Turkish

                                >Kyprianou</persName>’s major justification for rejecting the

                                had proposed their own separate state. <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                    >Kyprianou</persName> explained that because a unified Cyprus
                                was his government’s starting point of negotiations, his rejection
                                of the Turkish Cypriot proposals was not based on particular details
                                but on the “whole structure” and the “philosophy” of the proposals.

                            when we met and hence omitted detailed discussion. I drew the impression
                            that <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> had only recently
                            examined the constitutional ideas and conceded merit in Nicosia’s
                            arguments.</p>
                        <p>3. Turning to the embargo, <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName>
                            said he was worried about what he believed would be a nasty reaction in
                            Athens “when” it is lifted. He takes congressional approval as a given.
                            He mentioned this, he said, because he is concerned that Washington
                            underestimates the impact repeal will cause here while overestimating
                            Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_CC_1">Caramanlis</persName>’
                            ability to control it. “He is no magician,” <persName corresp="#p_RG_1"
                                >Rallis</persName> said, adding that <persName corresp="#p_CC_1"
                                >Caramanlis</persName> himself may underestimate the political
                            difficulty and public clamor that will ensue. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> did agree with me that
                            continuation of the embargo was in no one’s interest and that it had
                            become the psychological obstacle which frustrated relations among all
                            interested parties, including the Congress and the Executive Branch in
                            Washington. He reluctantly acknowledged that it would be better to have
                            it done and out of the way sooner than later and that all of us had some
                            responsibility to moderate the emotions which surround the issue.</p>
                        <p>4. All of this showed a much less sanguine <persName corresp="#p_RG_1"
                                >Rallis</persName> than I first met shortly after assuming office.
                            Maybe he recognizes the Murphy’s Law that plays in every Foreign
                            Minister’s life. Whatever, he is now less critical of the <gloss

                                a genuine peace offering or was a propaganda ploy, the Embassy
                                reported that early reactions from Turkey appeared positive; if

                            <salute>Dear Mr. President:</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>I have had the opportunity on many occasions to draw the attention of
                            your government on the consequences which the lifting of the embargo
                            might entail. I persist in believing that while the embargo constitutes
                            a domestic affair of the United States, its lifting nevertheless, will
                            not only make the solution of the Cyprus problem more difficult, but
                            will also dangerously complicate Greek-Turkish differences in the
                            Aegean. For Turkey will become more intransigent, especially if, through
                            the lifting of the embargo, the present balance of the military strength
                            between the two countries were to be altered to the detriment of Greece.
                            At the same time the lifting of the embargo will cause strong bitterness
                            in the public opinion of my country and will adversely affect the
                            development of Greek-American relations.</p>
                        <p>For all these reasons, I believe that it is imperative to maintain the
                            embargo, in order to avoid a further worsening of the present
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>Should, however, in spite of the above the lifting of the embargo be
                            decided, it could be possible to limit the aforementioned dangers, if
                            Congress were to provide certain assurances for the future.</p>
                        <pb n="552" facs="0585" xml:id="pg_552"/>
                        <p>These assurances should, in my view, cover the following points:<note

                                it is probably too late to have them fully incorporated into the
                                amendment on which the House acts today. However, we will try. There
                                is also the possibility that they could be in the House-Senate

                            achievement of such a solution and shall determine accordingly the

                        <p>2. Military assistance to Greece and Turkey shall be given solely for
                            defensive purposes and shall be designed in such a way as to insure the
                            preservation of the present balance of military strength between the two
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>3. The United States shall actively support the resolution of differences
                            regarding the Aegean through internationally established peace-ful
                            procedures, shall encourage the parties to avoid provocative actions and
                            shall strongly and effectively oppose any attempt to resolve such
                            disputes through force or threat of force.<note n="3" xml:id="d179fn3"

                        <p>I appreciate your message of August 1 about the Turkish arms
                                embargo.<note n="2" xml:id="d180fn2">See <ref target="#d179"
                                    >Document 179</ref>.</note> I fully share your view that we must
                            do everything possible to insure that lifting the embargo leads to
                            positive results.</p>
                        <p>As you know, the House and Senate versions of the legislation will now be
                            sent to the conference committee which will determine the final form of
                            this legislation. The <persName corresp="#p_BRC_1">Byrd</persName>
                            Amendment adopted in the Senate accords with the points conveyed in your
                            message, and I would accept the incorporation of similar language in the
                            bill as it is ultimately worked out in the House-Senate conference. In
                            my statement on the House action, I stressed our belief that disputes in
                            the Eastern Mediterranean must be settled peacefully.<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d180fn3">See <ref target="#d121">Document 121</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>A just settlement on Cyprus is of great concern to me. In the days
                            preceding action by the Congress, we saw hopeful signs of flexibility
                                <pb n="554" facs="0587" xml:id="pg_554"/>and movement—primarily
                            relating to the important city of Varosha. As you are aware, I became
                            convinced that the embargo represented an obstacle to progress on
                            Cyprus, and that resolution of the outstanding problems in the Eastern
                            Mediterranean was unlikely as long as the embargo was in force. The
                            United States will move actively in the search for progress on these
                            issues. I believe it is important that all the countries in the region
                            join in this endeavor.</p>
                        <p>There can be no question of the cardinal importance that the United
                            States attaches to strong ties with Greece. I stand ready to work
                            closely with you in strengthening those relations.</p>
                        <p>Another goal we share is the return of Greece to the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> integrated military command on a
                            basis acceptable to Greece and to the Alliance. For our part, we intend
                            to give this matter special priority in the weeks ahead.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, we are encouraged that you have continued your discussions
                            with Turkey on differences in the Aegean. It remains our position—as I
                            stated—that these differences should be resolved by peaceful procedures
                            and that the United States would actively and unequivocally oppose any
                            resort to force in the area.</p>
                        <p>I hope that in the coming months we can make renewed efforts to improve
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Greek relations, move toward a
                            just and durable settlement on Cyprus, and work to resolve differences
                            between Greece and Turkey.</p>

                            Turkish relations <gloss target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss> had recently had

                        <p>3. With regard to Greek <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                            relationship, <gloss target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss> had been told that
                            Turkish military <gloss target="#t_Rep_1">rep</gloss> in Brussels had
                            informed his colleagues in Brussels that Turkey refused to accept that
                            airspace above Greek islands should be under Greek control. <persName

                            be delayed because of the Turkish attitude. <persName corresp="#p_KK_1"

                                >GOG</gloss> could not accept a situation which was indefinitely
                            suspended. If the Turks insist on positions which were unacceptable to

                            to withdraw its request. The <gloss target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss> had
                            expected a decision in <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> in

                            started because of the Turkish attitude.</p>
                        <p>4. The Secretary said he would take note of this situation and would be
                            interested in views of General <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1"
                                >Haig</persName> on how the process could be accelerated. <persName

                            what General <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> had done.</p>
                        <p>5. The Secretary recalled that he had talked earlier in the day with

                            that on the Aegean the two sides were talking past each other. The Turks
                            claimed that the lack of Greek desire to resolve issues had prevented
                            progress at the talks in Athens last week on Aegean issues. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> then described the airspace
                            concessions which the Greeks had made relating to notification
                            procedures, reducing the size of the Limnos <gloss target="#t_TMA_1"
                                >TMA</gloss> area, and modifying an air corridor near the Turkish
                            coast. Agreement had been reached on many points but the Turks had
                            insisted on the reduction of the ten nautical mile airspace around the
                            islands. <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> again said that
                            this issue could be discussed later after all else had been solved but
                            it could not be solved now. He had told <persName corresp="#p_ES_1"
                                >Elekdag</persName> that the Turks should reserve their position and
                            that an agreement should be concluded which would allow flights to
                            resume over the Aegean. <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName>
                            said he would meet with <persName corresp="#p_OG_1">Okcun</persName>

                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> reiterated that the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss> is anxious about its special
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> link and stressed that time
                            was running out. He felt that Turkey sought <pb n="557" facs="0590"
                                xml:id="pg_557"/>to involve <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                            in resolution of the Aegean issues. Secretary repeated that US would do
                            what it could to help further, although he recognized the problems that
                            were involved. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> said that
                            we had made clear to the Turks that we regard Greek return to <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> as a high priority matter and that
                            all Aegean political issues should not be resolved in that process.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> said that with respect
                            to Cyprus, the <gloss target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss> could give advice to
                            the Greek Cypriots but he did not see how early progress on that issue
                            could be accomplished given the present Turkish attitude.</p>
                        <p>8. With respect to Oct 18–22 visit to Athens of Deputy Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName>, Secretary said
                            he was very pleased that <gloss target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss> had agreed
                            to receive <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> since he
                            felt it was important to find ways to build the US-Greek relationship
                            beyond the security focus of the past.<note n="6" xml:id="d181fn6">See

                            <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> would be prepared to
                            talk in depth on all matters of mutual concern. We wanted to strengthen
                            our overall relationship and find a basis to build for the future.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> said the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss> agreed with that objective but was
                            concerned that political problems with Turkey would affect the
                            development of the relationship with the US. He wanted to have
                            constructive talks with <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1"
                                >Christopher</persName> in Athens. If there was no solution on the
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> question and no improvement
                            in Greek-Turkish relations, he was afraid that the talks might take
                            place under a “heavy atmosphere”. <persName corresp="#p_KK_1"
                                >Karamanlis</persName> had acted calmly and responsibly throughout
                            the entire recent period, including during the embargo debate, but there
                            were limits beyond which it would be hard to pass.</p>
                        <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> said the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss> had told the Turks that if the Turkish
                            side came up with better Cyprus proposals, this would perhaps lead to a
                            new round of intercommunal talks. He could not speak for the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> but the Greek Government had sought to
                            improve the negotiating atmosphere and had encouraged <persName
                                corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> not to go to the Security
                            Council. If, however, there was nothing new in October, the Greeks could
                            not continue to discourage recourse to the Security Council. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> said he would see <persName
                                corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> Sept 28, but feared there was
                            nothing to tell him about developments since they last met in
                            August.</p>
                        <p>10. At the conclusion of the meeting it was agreed that both sides would
                            indicate to the press that discussions had covered bilateral relations,

                        <p>Summary: In early October 1978 Greek Prime Minister <persName

                                    >RG</gloss> 59, Central Foreign Policy File, D780382–0612) In
                                telegram 8535 from Ankara, October 2, the Embassy reported on
                                Turkish insistence on linking unresolved issues of control and

                                Turkey’s basic objective was to prevent Greece from achieving

                            <salute>Dear Mr. Prime Minister:</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>In our meetings together I have been impressed by our common agreement on
                            one vital fact: that the United States and Greece have a fundamental
                            interest in the maintenance and strengthening of our mutual ties. Over
                            the last four years you have made a lasting contribution toward that
                            goal.</p>
                        <p>Together we can do much more, and I hope it will now be possible to take
                            new steps to increase the range and depth of our bilateral relationship
                            as well as to expand our cooperation in regional and global issues.
                            Deputy Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName>’s
                            visit to Athens is an important part of this effort, and I was therefore
                            pleased that you have agreed to receive him and are taking a personal
                            and direct interest in his mission.<note n="2" xml:id="d183fn2">In

                        </p>
                        <p>I have instructed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName>
                            to discuss in depth the entire spectrum of our relations. I want you to
                            know how we perceive areas of mutual concern, and I will welcome your
                            own analysis and suggestions regarding these matters. As you know, we
                            have continued to work actively for the return of Greece to the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> integrated command structure on a
                            basis acceptable to Greece and the Alliance. In Cyprus, we are convinced
                            that there is now a chance for real progress if all parties concerned
                            make the necessary effort. We believe Greek-Turkish differences in the
                            Aegean must be settled peacefully, and the United States, as you know,
                            would actively and unequivocally oppose any resort to force in the
                            area.</p>
                        <p>Fortunately, the Greek-American relationship rests on mutual ties and
                            interests that go beyond the political issues which so often occupy our
                            attention. It is my hope that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1"
                                >Christopher</persName>’s mission will also help lay the foundations
                            for a broadened official relationship that more fully reflects how much
                            we have in common. I hope significant progress will be made toward more
                            effective cooperation in economic, scientific, cultural and technical
                            fields so that we can address together many of the major challenges
                            facing modern democracies.</p>

                        <p>America’s most important relationships are those with its democratic
                            allies. I look forward to the next occasion when I will be able to meet
                            with you and have the benefit of your thoughts and wisdom.</p>

                            the previous evening with the Prime Minister and centered on two
                            questions: <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> re-integration and the
                            military balance.</p>
                        <p>3. <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> re-integration: <persName
                                corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> opened by describing the
                            deterioration of Greek-American relations as a result of the Greek
                            people’s belief that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> had
                            favored the Junta and had failed to prevent the second Cyprus invasion.
                            This attitude, he said, was exploited by the Greek left in 1975–76 to
                            encourage large demonstrations against ship visits and the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Embassy. Singularly due to the Prime
                            Minister’s efforts, he said, the atmosphere had changed entirely but he
                            fears it is in danger of deteriorating once again simply because of what
                            Greece is asked to accept in connection with the re-establishment of
                            links with <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>4. Upon instructions of <persName corresp="#p_KK_1"
                            >Karamanlis</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName>
                            then detailed why the <gloss target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss> could not
                            accept the Turkish conditions on proposals that General <persName
                                corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> had endorsed and for which he had
                            congratulated the Greek military leadership. If the Military Committee
                            changed <gloss target="#t_SACEUR_1">SACEUR</gloss>’s original assessment
                            and required Greece to make compensations to Turkey, he said, “it would
                            be best to postpone taking any decisions while the <gloss

                            that the proposals are accepted.” Greece could not start negotiations
                            and would be obliged to withdraw its proposal, with the following
                            consequences: (a) The degree of Greek-<gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss> military cooperation that has been possible even
                            though Greece has not been a member of the integrated military
                            structure, would naturally have to be “re-examined.” (b) Since the fate

                            the absence of a “special relationship” would put them into
                            question.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> responded that the
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> is firmly and deeply committed
                            to Greek re-integration as soon as possible, but that matters were not
                            as in 1974. Command and force structures have evolved, necessitating
                            adjustments. The <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>-<persName
                                corresp="#p_DJ_1">Davos</persName> Arrangements were consistent with
                            Alliance principles and were basically acceptable to the allies as a
                            workable framework for re-integration. However, there remain the
                            delicate problems of command and control. The Military Committee
                            decision, as yet unknown, would not be a final decision but rather an
                            interim finding by a body that probably would feel it did not have
                            jurisdiction to settle all problems. It was the US intention to
                            intensify its efforts, working with other allies, to reach a political
                            decision bringing Greece back in on a basis acceptable to Greece.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> remarked that in
                            the light of <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName>’ deep
                            concern for maintaining Greek security, the withdrawal step <persName
                                corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> warned of would have the
                            opposite effect. He hoped that Greece would not take such an action.
                            Moreover, the areas of agreement are already very large, and the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> acknowledges a responsibility to
                            expedite a solution on the few remaining issues.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> clarified that if the
                                <gloss target="#t_MC_1">MC</gloss> decision were unanimously to
                            change the <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> assessment,
                            Greece would be forced to withdraw its proposal. If, on the other hand,
                            there were a majority decision supportive of the <persName
                                corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> assessment with Turkey in the
                            minority, then Greece would permit the matter to continue to be
                            discussed. He reiterated what <persName corresp="#p_KK_1"
                                >Karamanlis</persName> had said, that Greece cannot return under
                            conditions less favorable than 1974. <persName corresp="#p_RG_1"
                                >Rallis</persName> acknowledged things had changed since 1974, but
                            remarked that not very much had changed since <persName
                                corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> found the Greek proposals
                            acceptable a few months ago. He concluded, “Greece is at the limit;
                            nothing more can be accepted.” He continued that even a split <gloss
                                target="#t_MC_1">MC</gloss> decision and continued discussion of
                            open issues would cause the <gloss target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss> public
                            and parliamentary problems and concluded that, if Greece is not needed
                            by <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>, then <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> should inform Greece of that fact
                            and Greece would draw its own conclusions.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> described the
                            difficult position in which the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                            finds itself, torn between two allies who have lost confidence in each
                            other. Without wanting to take sides, he indicated the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> had reason to hope Turkey would take a
                            conciliatory approach to remaining problems. On the other hand,
                            notwithstanding some sympathy for the Greek position, it is essential to
                            find a way to achieve re-integration without prejudicing Aegean
                            political matters. The issue needed quiet, careful thought. Perhaps, he
                            suggested, command arrangements could be separated from bilateral
                            problems, as he understood Greece and General <persName
                                corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> wanted. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> agreed fully, but said that
                            unfortunately <pb n="563" facs="0596" xml:id="pg_563"/>Turkey had
                            hardened its positions and raised the public awareness of this problem’s
                            political aspect with recent statements, while Greece has tried to keep
                            the matter private.</p>
                        <p>8. At this point Averoff, speaking for the first time, described the
                            military steps Greece has taken to better relations with the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> (re-commitment of certain
                            nuclear-capable units, participation in nearly all exercises, submission
                            of <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> re-integration proposals,
                            continued functioning of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> facilities
                            “practically as they were before”), but said <persName corresp="#p_KK_1"
                                >Karamanlis</persName>, despite his strong political position, could
                            not do everything to improve ties. He acknowledged the Greek obsession
                            with security of the Aegean islands and claimed that Greece could not
                            let <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> discussions aid Turkey’s
                            claims against the islands. After discussing the military balance
                            question, Averoff returned to the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                            problem with the statement that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            representatives who helped prepare the second Military Committee draft
                            had played a very active and, to Greece, disagreeable role when they
                            tried to accommodate Turkish pressures. When he heard that, Averoff
                            said, he became less optimistic and feared the Turks were being
                            successful.</p>
                        <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> asked whether
                            there is a legitimate Turkish concern that the <persName
                                corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_DJ_1"
                                >Davos</persName> Arrangement might prejudice Turkish positions in
                            bilateral talks. After further probing, Averoff finally stated, ad
                            referendum, that Greece could undertake not to use command arrangements
                            in bilateral political discussions if that would help. In response to a
                            question, <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tzounis</persName> said Greece
                            could not use, for example, the line drawn in the Aegean for <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> command purposes in the continental
                            shelf talks because that problem was resolvable on the basis of
                            international law alone; the International Court would not accept
                            command arrangements as relevant. On the other hand, Turkey does not
                            want, according to <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tzounis</persName>, to
                            isolate juridical issues but wants a political discussion where she
                            would use new command arrangements against Greece. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> and Averoff agreed that
                            the urgent matter now on the table was <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss> re-integration, and Averoff reiterated that command
                            arrangements “certainly” could be settled without prejudice to bilateral
                            political problems. (Comment: Subsequently, <persName corresp="#p_TV_1"
                                >Theodoropoulos</persName> advised <persName corresp="#p_NM_1"
                                >Nimetz</persName> that the statement Averoff had made ad referendum
                            had been checked with the Prime Minister who agreed that Greece would
                            not use any command arrangements made in the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss> context to bolster its position in bilateral
                            negotiations with Turkey on Aegean issues.)</p>
                        <p>10. The military balance. Averoff cited the second Turkish invasion of
                            Cyprus, various <gloss target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> official statements
                            about how the Aegean islands must become Turkish, including an alleged
                                <gloss target="#t_TGS_1">TGS</gloss> manual, as creating Greek
                            concerns about the security of the islands. He said Greece also
                            recognized the Warsaw Pact threat in response to which <pb n="564"
                                facs="0597" xml:id="pg_564"/>Greece cultivates “very close”
                            relations with Yugoslavia, strongly defends the Bulgarian border and
                            seeks re-entry into <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>. But all that
                            did not mean Greece could neglect defending its islands. Defenseless,
                            they could be taken in 24 hours and could not be retaken. He stressed
                            that armed islands were no threat to Turkey, as geography made
                            obvious.</p>
                        <p>11. Greece, he said, had the possibility of an easy way out—the extension
                            of territorial waters to 12 miles thereby reducing international waters
                            in the Aegean from 50 to 20 percent. However, Greece is not following
                            that course because it wants a solution. Meanwhile it needs a balance in
                            the area so it can defend itself. (Averoff parenthetically allowed that
                            the Greek-Turkish quarrel and the resultant arms race were “crazy and
                            disastrous” for both countries.) The Greek General Staff believes there
                            is a balance today and no Greek government could prejudice that
                            position. A balance gives security to Greece and dissuades Turkey from
                            foolish and destructive moves.</p>
                        <p>12. <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> allowed that it
                            was not for the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> to say whether
                            Greece’s apprehensions were justified; clearly, they were strongly felt.
                            The President was committed not to alter the regional balance. Congress
                            had taken account of the Greek concern, but had broadened the context to
                            include the Warsaw Pact-<gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> balance
                            as well as countries in the area. He said the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> would live up to the legislation by not providing
                            provocative, technologically advanced weaponry to one and not the other.
                            In addition there would be an annual review by our experts as well as
                            the Congress in connection with security assistance legislation. He
                            stressed, as he had to <persName corresp="#p_KK_1"
                            >Karamanlis</persName>, that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            would be as conscientious as it could not to upset the balance, but that
                            such refined judgments would consider the overall regional picture and
                            not be based on dollar-for-dollar comparisons.</p>
                        <p>13. Greek-Turkish differences. At various times during the discussion,
                            Aegean air space and continental shelf matters were addressed. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> expressed the hope that
                            both countries could work together to regain mutual confidence.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> drew on his recent
                            meeting in New York with Turkish Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_OG_1">Okcun</persName> (who he had heard was a hard man)
                            to indicate that the latter had tried to find solutions to problems but
                            that <persName corresp="#p_ES_1">Elekdag</persName> had “stopped him
                            from being rational.” It was the experts, <persName corresp="#p_RG_1"
                                >Rallis</persName> said, who forced things to an impasse with
                            impossible demands. When asked whether bilateral discussions had
                            included <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> re-entry, <persName
                                corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> described how he had attempted
                            to pin <persName corresp="#p_OG_1">Okcun</persName> down on the question
                            of Aegean air space so that commercial traffic could be resumed. When
                            the Turks had called for reduction of the Greek territorial air space
                            around islands from ten to six nautical miles, <persName
                                corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> had immediately offered to phone
                                <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName> and strike a
                            bargain if that were all that was required to settle the matter.

                            the continental shelf, the arming of the islands, and Greek re-entry
                            into <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> as other questions that
                            needed to be resolved at the same time.</p>
                        <p>14. In connection with air space, <persName corresp="#p_NM_1"
                                >Nimetz</persName> said he had thought the only major sticking point
                            was the 10-mile question. <persName corresp="#p_TV_1"
                                >Theodoropoulos</persName> said two basic differences remained: (a)
                            the 10-mile airspace around islands established in 1931 and recognized
                            by the Turks until 1975, and (b) early warning.<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d184fn4">The 10-mile designation was made by Greek
                                Presidential decree in 1931, and observed by Turkey until the
                                outbreak of hostilities over Cyprus in 1974–1975.</note> It had been
                            agreed that the 10-mile issue should be deferred until the end, but the
                            Turks kept bringing it up as a precondition. Greece was willing to have
                            the Turks make a reservation on the issue, even though it had been
                            explicitly acknowledged by them in pre-1975 [garble—notes] covering
                            military exercises. With respect to early warning, Greece was willing to
                            do so in an area west of the <gloss target="#t_FIR_1">FIR</gloss> line
                            but Turkey refused to give Greece reciprocity east of the <gloss
                                target="#t_FIR_1">FIR</gloss> line. Instead it wanted to divide the
                            Aegean into two zones with the <gloss target="#t_NOTAM_1">NOTAM</gloss>
                            714 line as the early warning boundary.</p>
                        <p>15. Defense industrial cooperation. At the end of the session, <persName
                                corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> offered to have a team of
                            experts come to Greece to investigate the possibilities for the
                            co-production of military weaponry. He noted that the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> would also be doing this with Turkey
                            within the framework of <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                            standardization and interoperability, and that, in both cases, there
                            could be no guarantees that any concrete steps would flow from these
                            feasibility studies. Averoff welcomed the offer and agreed that a
                            mutually convenient time be set in the near future in coordination with
                            the Embassy.</p>
                        <p>16. Broadening the relationship. <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1"
                                >Christopher</persName> asked how the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> could strengthen our relationship in the aftermath of
                            the lifting of the Turkish arms embargo. <persName corresp="#p_RG_1"
                                >Rallis</persName> replied that the relationship could not be
                            strengthened unless the political climate were improved. That depended
                            on solving the problems that had just been discussed, i.e. <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> re-entry and the Aegean balance,
                            which in turn depended on the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> He
                            declared the relationship would be harmed if there were an attempt to
                            discuss health problems, for example, when national problems were not
                            yet solved. Averoff called on the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            not to provide additional ammunition to the anti-American extreme left
                            which is so adept at destructive sloganeering. The <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> should not take actions that could be
                            characterized by them as pro-Turkish or which gave the impression of
                            sustaining Turkey at the expense of Greece, for this would outweigh the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss>’s statements of the opposite.
                            Averoff also asked for an authoritative account of steps he knows the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> took (a) to disassociate itself
                            from the military dictatorship and (b) to stop the 1974 coup <pb n="566"
                                facs="0599" xml:id="pg_566"/>against <persName corresp="#p_M3_1"
                                >Makarios</persName>. He said the record was not excellent, but it
                            certainly was much better than was publicly believed. Authoritative
                            clarification would have a large impact.</p>
                        <p>17. <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> referred again to all
                            the <gloss target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss> and <persName corresp="#p_KK_1"
                                >Karamanlis</persName> had done to improve Greek-<gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> relations since 1974, but said that
                            current problems could undo it. <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1"
                                >Christopher</persName> concluded that the <gloss target="#t_GOG_1"
                                >GOG</gloss> could take pride in having achieved such prosperity
                            since 1974 in the context of strengthened democracy. But, he added, he
                            wanted it understood that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> did
                            not have unilateral control over the problems of Cyprus or <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> re-entry, and that although these
                            were impediments to better relations they could not be solved by the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> alone.</p>

                            Stock.</p>
                        <p>1. In the wake of the visit of the Deputy Secretary to Athens we believe
                            it is useful to take stock of Greek Government positions and to assess
                            what they imply for the United States Government.</p>
                        <p>2. The Deputy Secretary’s talks with the Prime Minister and his leading
                            associates, plus some of the background maneuvering of the Greek
                            Government provide some telling insights into current <gloss
                                target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss> assumptions, policies and objectives
                            in dealing with the United States.<note n="2" xml:id="d185fn2">See <ref
                                    target="#d184">Document 184</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>—A dependent relationship with the United States remains at the epicenter
                            of Greek foreign policy. The Prime Minister and his colleagues made it
                            clear that they harbor affection for the United States and look to the
                            United States for leadership. They also underlined that they desire
                            United States support on matters they consider of vital importance to
                            Greece and displayed an exaggerated confidence that the United States
                            can impose its will on others, particularly on Turkey.</p>
                        <pb n="567" facs="0600" xml:id="pg_567"/>
                        <p>—Our responsiveness to Greece’s obsessive concern for security from the
                            Turks has now explicitly become the yardstick by which the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss> measures Greek-American relations.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName> put it best when
                            he told the Deputy Secretary in effect: “Guarantee our security and
                            everything else loses importance.” By explicitly placing the Turkish
                            threat to Greece at the center of Greek-American relations, the Greek
                            Government has completed an important transition. Cyprus has now been
                            clearly relegated to a secondary position. Given the long standing Greek
                            fear of Turkey, this change is mostly presentational and is a reflection
                            of the lifting of the embargo.</p>
                        <p>—In a remarkable switch, the Greek Government has moved from reluctance
                            to rejoin <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> to anxiety because it
                            cannot quickly rejoin the Alliance on terms acceptable to it. Privately,
                            this new line began to emerge last January, but now the Greek public has
                            been informed and there has been no great outcry against the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss>’s posture, though for three years
                            Greek leaders insisted that Greek public opinion would never tolerate a
                            return to <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> absent a Cyprus
                            settlement.</p>
                        <p>—On “balance” the <gloss target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss> officials listened
                            and did not dispute the Deputy Secretary’s presentations. However, it
                            also seems clear that they did not abandon a much more restrictive
                            interpretation of what constitutes balance and we can expect that each
                            time they learn of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> assistance to
                            Turkey they will seek “balancing” assistance to Greece.</p>
                        <p>—The Greek Government is convinced that the United States bowed to
                            Turkish “blackmail” in lifting the embargo. Accordingly it has adopted a
                            very tough position on <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                            reintegration, privately threatening to abort the reintegration process
                            and to review their existing military cooperation with <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> as well as the status of <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> military facilities in Greece if the
                                <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>–<persName
                                corresp="#p_DJ_1">Davos</persName> Arrangement does not prevail.
                                <gloss target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss> spokesmen have obviously
                            backgrounded this position to the press.</p>
                        <p>—The Greek Government accepted in principle the possibility of divorcing
                            political from military considerations on the reintegration question.
                            Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName>
                            confirmed that Greece could undertake not to use <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> command arrangements in the
                            bilateral dispute with Turkey. At present we suspect that while the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss> will continue to insist on
                            returning to <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> under pre-1974
                            terms, they could be persuaded not to use such an arrangement in their
                            bilateral dispute with Turkey and to say so to Turkey if Turkey would
                            make the same commitment.</p>
                        <p>—Its actions clearly indicated that the Greek Government is not ready to
                            do very much, if anything, to improve the public atmosphere in which the
                            two nations conduct their relations. This posture was reflected in the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss>’s decision not to have a
                            prepared toast at the Ambassador’s dinner; in the cold, tough first
                            draft of the joint statement <pb n="568" facs="0601" xml:id="pg_568"
                            />they presented us; and the Foreign Ministry’s disinterest, even
                            resistance, to expanding Greek-American cooperation in the non-security
                            areas.</p>
                        <p>—Among the technocrats in the <gloss target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss> there
                            is a broad and deep desire to strengthen non-security cooperation
                            between the two countries. This pressure from within the Greek
                            bureaucracy was spontaneous and probably embarrassed Greece’s foreign
                            policy managers who attempted to belittle and diminish this aspect of
                            the Deputy Secretary’s visit. This negative attitude by foreign
                            policymakers reflected also their fear that non-security cooperation
                            would divert attention from our uneasy political and security
                            cooperation, the last thing that <persName corresp="#p_KK_1"
                                >Karamanlis</persName> and his advisers want to happen.</p>
                        <p>3. If our analysis above is correct we believe that it implies certain
                            conclusions for the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Government.</p>
                        <p>—Obviously we can expect another difficult period in our relations with
                            Greece. Reintegration and “balance” will be the rings in which these
                            difficulties are manifest, but Greek security concerns in the Aegean
                            will underlie these issues.</p>
                        <p>—The <gloss target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss> will continue the pressure on
                            the United States to help it meet the “Turkish threat” in the Aegean.
                            Particularly, as the Prime Minister so clearly suggested, the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss> will seek a more concrete, explicit
                            “guarantee”. With the relative downgrading of Cyprus as an ingredient in
                            Greek-American relations this Greek demand will probably be more
                            insistent and more difficult to deal with. In addition, it behooves the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Government to develop for its
                            own internal use a better sense of what we mean by such words as
                            “unequivocally and actively oppose the use of force” should we one day
                            face a situation in which Turkish or Greek actions call our hand. We
                            note that even simple repetition of our standard “guarantee” formulation
                            tends to give it concrete political form even though it continues to
                            lack any binding legal content.</p>
                        <p>—We are going to have to take seriously Greek threats on aborting the
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> reintegration process and
                            reviewing the status of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> bases

                            abandoned. We continue to believe that there is some bluster and bluff
                            in their words—the Greeks know as well as we the costs to themselves if
                            they ever had to follow through on these words. And <persName
                                corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName> has taken a somewhat softer
                            public stance—on October 21 he talked about Greece not being in a hurry
                            and said Turkey would bear responsibility for the prolongation of the
                            present situation.<note n="3" xml:id="d185fn3">

                            the <gloss target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss> on this matter, not as a

                        <p>—We should quickly mobilize ourselves to follow through on the
                            non-security non-political aspects of Greek-American cooperation, taking
                            advantage of the Greek technical agencies’ interest.</p>
                        <p>—We might ask the <gloss target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss> how it thinks we
                            can together deal with anti-American sentiments in Greece—perhaps
                            exploring Averoff’s suggestion (one he has been making for some time and
                            which we believe is a personal one) that we seek greater opportunity to
                            rebut popular beliefs that we installed the Junta and encouraged the
                            Turkish venture in Cyprus. We should be careful not to fuel
                            anti-Americanism through our words or deeds, but we also should not let
                            ourselves be bullied by the <gloss target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss> over
                            threatened anti-Americanism and its impact on Greek-American
                            relations.</p>
                        <p>—We should keep mindful that however friendly to the United States, this
                            is a fearful nation which seeks to compensate for its weakness by
                            looking to us. Our patience will be tried but so will our ability to
                            understand the fears and the needs of our weak and vulnerable ally.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> on present US
                            attitude toward Cyprus problem. <persName corresp="#p_RG_1"
                                >Rallis</persName> said he had hoped <gloss target="#t_GOC_1"
                                >GOC</gloss> would reach decision before Moscow (and <gloss

                            Before leaving Athens <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> said
                            he had instructed the Greek Ambas<pb n="571" facs="0604" xml:id="pg_571"
                            />sador in Nicosia to suggest to <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1"
                                >Rolandis</persName> the possibility of his going to New York to ask
                                <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> to make the
                            framework paper his own. <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName>
                            said it was useful that some prominent Turks had criticized paper; this
                            could encourage Greek Cypriots to accept. <persName corresp="#p_RG_1"
                                >Rallis</persName> said that <gloss target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss>
                            thought it essential that arrangements for Varosha resettlement be done
                            prior to resumption intercommunal talks so that resettlement could begin
                            in phase with negotiations.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> said he agreed
                            with <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> about Varosha but
                            noted that <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> seemed to
                            want to handle Varosha in plenary. <persName corresp="#p_RG_1"
                                >Rallis</persName> said that would be most unfortunate. <persName
                                corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tzounis</persName> suggested that the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> should discuss Varosha after both
                            parties had accepted the framework paper. <persName corresp="#p_RG_1"
                                >Rallis</persName> said he thought that any other approach to
                            Varosha would cause difficulties for the Greek Cypriots. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> said we strongly preferred
                            to make progress on Varosha before the intercommunal talks.</p>
                        <p>5. In response to <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName>’s

                                >Rallis</persName> described situation as one of deadlock. Since

                            had been public declarations by Turkish Prime Minister and Defense
                            Minister and recently three prominent Turkish journalists had told
                            Averoff that there was no hope of re-negotiation [<hi rend="italic"
                                >reintegration</hi>?] until all Aegean problems were solved. If this
                            is the real Turkish position, then Greece cannot re-enter <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_RG_1"
                                >Rallis</persName> said he would be meeting <persName
                                corresp="#p_OG_1">Okcun</persName> after dinner December 7.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> said that in recent
                            Paris talks on Aegean continental shelf Turkish negotiator had for the
                            first time indicated what Turks really want in shelf delimitation. When
                            these negotiators met again in January, there was hope that further
                            progress could be made.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> stressed strongly that
                            no Greek Prime Minister could at this time accept any change in Aegean
                            air control which would involve Turkey controlling air over Greek
                            islands. That would involve question of sovereignty. With regard to
                            alleged Turkish anxiety about security, Greeks were prepared to provide
                            extensive information about Greek flights over Aegean to Greek islands
                            and were asking only for information on Turkish flights within 20 miles
                            of coast.</p>
                        <p>8. With respect to Greece/<gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>, Legacos
                            stressed that this was not Greece/Turkey bilateral problem but rather
                            issue involving Alliance and Turkey.</p>
                        <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> recalled that at
                            Strasbourg meeting two weeks ago <persName corresp="#p_OG_1"
                                >Okcun</persName> had suggested that two Prime Ministers meet to
                            divide Aegean. Greek view was that only through prior preparation by
                            experts could such difficult questions as continental shelf, minorities,
                            air space, status of islands, etc., be handled in manner that would be
                            acceptable to public opinion. <persName corresp="#p_KK_1"
                                >Karamanlis</persName> simply cannot divide Aegean with Turkey.</p>
                        <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> reaffirmed that <gloss
                                target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss> was prepared to declare in writing
                            that it would not use <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                            arrangements for bilateral political purposes in Aegean.</p>
                        <pb n="572" facs="0605" xml:id="pg_572"/>
                        <p>11. <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> reaffirmed that
                            US wanted to see early Greek reintegration and thought this should be
                            done on basis <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>/<persName
                                corresp="#p_DJ_1">Davos</persName> Arrangements with some few areas
                            of amplification. We were still pushing for solution and would continue
                            to do so over next few months.</p>
                        <p>12. <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> said that Greeks were
                            patient but thought that only Generals <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1"
                                >Haig</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DJ_1">Davos</persName>
                            could find solution to present deadlock. They should, however, be
                            instructed which questions to discuss and not attempt to review all
                            matters. It would also be best to have such discussions after a month or
                            so. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> noted that <persName
                                corresp="#p_ES_1">Elekdag</persName> had told him earlier in day
                            that Turkey wanted to isolate Greece/NATO question from other Aegean
                            issues. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> affirmed that we
                            think <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>/<persName
                                corresp="#p_DJ_1">Davos</persName> Arrangements reflect correct
                            boundaries and that exchanging information about aircraft flights could
                            help solve problem. <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> said
                            that these matters should be discussed later when the psychological mood
                            in Greece was better. He stressed that Greece wants to be friends with
                            Turkey but that third <persName corresp="#p_KK_1"
                                >Karamanlis</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>
                            meeting without productive results would be bad for public opinion in
                            both countries. Much has been achieved in past year; there is no clamor
                            in either country’s press for war.</p>
                        <p>13. <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> said he agreed
                            with <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> it was best to let
                            Greece/NATO cool for a few weeks and then resume consideration in
                            military channels in order to reach conclusions.</p>
                        <p>14. <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> recalled that he
                            had had good discussions in Athens regarding general security problems,
                            contingency situations, and our strong preference for peaceful
                            solutions.</p>
                        <p>15. <persName corresp="#p_TV_1">Theodoropoulos</persName> recalled that
                            US co-production team had productive visit to Greece and that <gloss

                            agriculture and Greek entry into <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> had
                            been discussed. While we were largely by-standers, <persName
                                corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> said we hoped Greece could

                            Cypriot independence, now is no longer controlling. Although sources of
                            Greek leverage still exist, there are limitations on their use in both
                            Nicosia and Athens. No Greek government can ignore Cyprus, although the
                            national interests of Greece and Cyprus on the Cyprus issue are not
                            identical and Greece is far more concerned over its relations with
                            Turkey. As she has done in the past, despite her public posture that the
                            Cyprus issue is for the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> to resolve,
                            Greece will continue to counsel the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>
                            to avoid intransigent stands and to seek a settlement with the Turkish
                            side. Within that framework it will be possible from time to time for us
                            to encourage the <gloss target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss> discreetly to push
                            the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> in a moderate direction. End

                                >Dountas</persName>) and whenever Cypriot leaders pass through
                            Athens, however, the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> does not
                            invariably seek the <gloss target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss>’s advice nor
                            does it always act on it. The relationship between Athens and Nicosia
                            has evolved over the past 20 years. The days are long since past when a
                            Greek government had the authority to impose its preferences for a
                            political settlement of the Cyprus issue on Nicosia, as Athens did with
                            the London and Zurich Accords of 1959. When Archbishop <persName
                                corresp="#p_M3_1">Makarios</persName> was not supported at the
                            London Conference by the <gloss target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss> in his
                            objection to the Zurich Agreement, he submitted to the decision of
                            Athens. Even after Cypriot independence was proclaimed the following
                            year, sporadic direct negotiations between the <gloss target="#t_GOG_1"
                                >GOG</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> on the
                            Cyprus issue were held, over the head of Nicosia.</p>
                        <pb n="574" facs="0607" xml:id="pg_574"/>
                        <p>5. In more recent years the trend toward a more forthright assertion of
                            Cypriot independence has coincided with a <gloss target="#t_GOG_1"
                                >GOG</gloss> perspective that the Greek people are tiring of the
                            Cyprus issue, that it will not be readily solved, and that the national
                            interests of Greece are not necessarily those of Cyprus. The result of
                            this evolution has been to increase the sense of political distance
                            between Nicosia and Athens. This is further aggravated by the general
                            lack of trust and confidence in President <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName>, who is regarded as being out of his depth by
                            most Greek leaders. Moreover, <persName corresp="#p_KK_1"
                                >Karamanlis</persName> is determined to avoid being drawn again into
                            the Cyprus vortex and is anxious to avoid repeating his pre-independence
                            experience which was costly to him in domestic political terms.</p>
                        <p>6. Despite the new equation between Nicosia and Athens, however, the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss> inevitably continues to carry
                            considerable weight with the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>. For
                            one thing, Nicosia still has substantial need of Athens, its main
                            supporter, for psychological as well as political reasons. The pervasive
                            appeal of “Hellenism” cannot be ignored. Moreover, Cyprus needs Greece’s
                            support in the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>, and Greece gives it
                            even though <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> recourse to the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> is sometimes made despite the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss>’s advice. Greek financial assistance
                            to Cyprus continues at substantial levels. A one billion drachmas (some
                            $28 million) annual line item for assistance was budgeted in 1977, 1978
                            and 1979, making Greece the largest foreign aid donor. In addition to
                            the 950-man Greek force in Cyprus, which is there legally under the
                            provisions of the London-Zurich Agreements, there are still an estimated
                            1000 Greek Army officers and men seconded to the 12,000-man Cypriot
                            National Guard, whose presence is not covered by those Agreements, as
                            well as one 300-man Greek raiding forces battalion. Thus, the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> listens attentively to <gloss
                                target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss> advice, even though it may not always
                            take it.</p>
                        <p>7. At the same time, there are limits to the degree that Athens is
                            willing to seek to influence Nicosia, and limits to the extent that any
                            such efforts can be successful. The Greek Government cannot put itself
                            in the position of urging the acceptance of a disadvantageous Cyprus
                            settlement. <gloss target="#t_PASOK_1">PASOK</gloss>’s <persName
                                corresp="#p_PA_1">Andreas Papandreou</persName>, and other
                            opposition lead-ers, would have a field day with a credible charge that
                            the <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName> government had
                            sacrificed Greek interests on Cyprus. Similar constraints operate in
                            Cyprus where Socialist Party (<gloss target="#t_EDEK_1">EDEK</gloss>)
                            leader Lyssaridis and Communist Party (<gloss target="#t_AKEL_1"
                                >AKEL</gloss>) chairman <persName corresp="#p_PE_1"
                                >Papaioannou</persName> would be quick to charge betrayal or sellout
                            by the <gloss target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss> if it advocated a course of
                            action that appeared to make too many concessions in the interest of a
                            settlement. Such constraints on Athens will not become an open fourth
                            party to the Cyprus negotiations.</p>
                        <p>8. Another considerable constraint that conditions the nature of Athens’
                            involvement in the Cyprus question is its perception that the <pb
                                n="575" facs="0608" xml:id="pg_575"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> may not be seriously looking for a
                            settlement of the issue. Since any settlement would entail some
                            risktaking and, inevitably, a measure of unpopularity for the government
                            that agreed to it (certainly in Athens as well as Nicosia, and we
                            suspect possibly Ankara as well), the Cyprus situation has in a way
                            produced its own stalemate. As seen from Athens, the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> appears to find it preferable to
                            continue with the known posture of keeping the present “struggle” going
                            indefinitely rather than embarking on the hazards of a new settlement.
                            If that is indeed the case, then there is even less incentive for Athens
                            to advance beyond what is politically possible in Nicosia.</p>
                        <p>9. In this context, since the prospects for an actual settlement are
                            assessed by the <gloss target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss> as remote,
                            underlying national interests are seen in sharper relief. And it should
                            be borne in mind that Greek and Cypriot national interests in the Cyprus
                            issue are far from identical. To Nicosia, of course, what is at stake
                            are the terms of national survival. To Athens, on the other hand, the
                            paramount issue is its relations with Turkey, and here the Aegean
                            problems are of first priority. Nevertheless, no Greek government can
                            appear to ignore Cyprus. <persName corresp="#p_KK_1"
                                >Karamanlis</persName> is quick to point out, both in private and in
                            public (as he did again during the January 16 foreign policy discussion
                            in Parliament), that “everything begins with Cyprus” and Turkish
                            agreement to a fair settlement there is essential. Yet the Aegean, and
                            not Cyprus, worries <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName>
                            and most Greeks and could be the cause of war, which Cyprus was not in
                            1974 and is even less likely to be now.</p>
                        <p>10. It is instructive to note some recent instances in which Greece has
                            given Cyprus advice on the issue. The <gloss target="#t_GOG_1"
                                >GOG</gloss>, we know, strongly urged the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1"
                                >GOC</gloss> to accept the US–UK-Canada non-paper, despite
                            reservations about some of its provisions, as a basis for resumption of
                            the intercommunal talks.<note n="3" xml:id="d187fn3">See <ref
                                    target="#d61fn2">footnote 2, Document 61</ref>.</note>
                            Unfortunately, the advice was not taken by the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1"
                                >GOC</gloss> and we find ourselves in the present impasse at least
                            in part because of this. When Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> found the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>’s formulation for <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Secretary General <persName
                                corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> last December to be so
                            negative that it would have been unacceptable to both <persName
                                corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> and the Turkish Cypriots, he
                            convinced <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName> to redraft
                            the formula along more moderate lines. Earlier, Athens reacted strongly
                            when <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> rejected the
                                <persName corresp="#p_DR_1">Denktash</persName> proposals on Varosha
                            last July out of hand and got <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName> to partially reverse himself subsequently. The
                            common thread of these events is that Athens will actively try to prod
                            Nicosia into more moderate paths when the <gloss target="#t_GOG_1"
                                >GOG</gloss> fears that Greek Cypriot intransigence may become the
                            issue. Such a course would directly undercut the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss>’s own interests, for Greek Cypriot
                            intransigence weakens the Greek Cypriot posture before other fora, and
                            particularly <pb n="576" facs="0609" xml:id="pg_576"/>before the
                            American Congress. The result might well be a lessening of American
                            concern over any decline in the prospects for a more positive Turkish
                            role on the Cyprus issue. In the worst case scenario from the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss> point of view, lack of constraints and
                            attention from the Congress (and an adjusted geopolitical situation in
                            the wake of recent events in Iran) might even lead to a real American
                            “tilt” towards Ankara. It must, of course, be a prime goal of any Greek
                            government to check any such development.</p>
                        <p>11. A real problem in this situation may be that since any settlement
                            will involve political risks, Nicosia may prefer the appearance rather
                            than the substance of forward motion on the Cyprus issue. Indeed, we
                            think it unlikely that in the absence of our non-paper, or some other
                            outside initiative, any movement toward resumption of negotiations would
                            have been possible. It follows that if the <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1"
                                >Waldheim</persName> plan succeeds in getting the parties to the
                            intercommunal negotiating table it may require artful outside pressures
                            to keep them there.</p>
                        <p>12. Clearly, a moderating Greek influence on Nicosia, even though not
                            decisive, can be helpful in nurturing the negotiating process and is
                            something we should continue to encourage when we have appropriate
                            opportunities to do so. This argues for close and frequent consultations
                            with the <gloss target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss> and keeping it informed of
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> thinking and actions in order
                            to gain Greek support. In doing this we should avoid pressing too hard
                            or asking for too much, always keeping in mind the limits of Greek
                            influence and thus of <gloss target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss> resistance to
                            becoming more directly and openly involved. The <gloss target="#t_GOG_1"
                                >GOG</gloss> would like to see a settlement on Cyprus and has
                            demonstrated its willingness to play a role, albeit quiet and indirect,
                            in pursuit of it. We should recognize this and act accordingly. More
                            than that, under present circumstances, would be unrealistic to
                            expect.</p>

                            Minister said that while at that time he might have disagreed with
                            various aspects of American foreign policy, he at least understood
                            America’s foreign policy objectives and had a valuable, ongoing dialogue
                            with the American administration. Now, he said, he does not know who
                            makes the decisions in Washington, what weight if any is given to Greek
                            affairs, or even whom to ask about these matters.</p>
                        <p>2. The Prime Minister said he does not attribute the stagnation in
                            Greek-American relations to ill will or to incompetence, but rather to a
                            lack of direction in Washington; apparently no one has set any foreign
                            policy objectives for relations with Greece. He is forced to wait until

                            unacceptable. He explained that the proposals or any new ones like them
                            took responsibility for the defense of Greek territory from Greece and
                            thus could not be accepted by any Greek government. He said that further
                            public airing of this issue could affect adversely Greek attitudes
                            toward <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> and recommended that the

                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> then outlined the

                                >Haig</persName> had asked to meet again with General <persName

                            close enough to the original that they could be considered also as
                            “amplifications.” Greece agreed. <persName corresp="#p_RG_1"
                                >Rallis</persName> noted that Greeks had accepted <gloss

                            exploratory and not mediation. Greeks were then very surprised to
                            receive next set of <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>
                            proposals.</p>
                        <p>6. At this point <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> unfolded
                            map of Aegean. He noted that latest <gloss target="#t_SACEUR_1"
                                >SACEUR</gloss> proposal would establish a military headquarters in
                            Larissa placing all Greek islands except one or two in a command and
                            control framework whereby Greek territory would not be defended by Greek
                            Air Force but by a third party. <persName corresp="#p_RG_1"
                                >Rallis</persName> reemphasized that virtually all islands in this
                            area were Greek. “To make pill sweeter”, proposal also included two
                            small Turkish islands.</p>
                        <p>7. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>, saying he was
                            not aware of the details of the <gloss target="#t_SACEUR_1"
                                >SACEUR</gloss> proposal, asked <persName corresp="#p_RG_1"
                                >Rallis</persName> to explain it. Latter said that foreign officer
                            (sic) at Larissa, with no Greek officers present in dealing with Aegean
                            command and control could entrust certain missions to whatever air force
                            he wanted, including of course Turkish Air Force.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> stressed that this
                            solution is unacceptable to any Greek for national reasons. Greece
                            cannot entrust the defense of Greek territory to any foreigner. There is
                            now a deadlock. General <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> has
                            reportedly stated he now knows the positions of both sides and will try
                            to formulate new proposals. <persName corresp="#p_RG_1"
                                >Rallis</persName> said that if new proposals are similar to or even
                            only “50 per cent” of old ones, Greeks would prefer that they not be put
                            forward. He explained that proposals would have to be rejected and Greek
                            proposal for <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> reintegration would
                            have to be withdrawn. <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> said
                            he had previously explained to both Secretary and <gloss
                                target="#t_DepSec_1">DepSec</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> the consequences of
                            such a rejection. Accordingly, it would be best to “freeze matters” at
                            this stage.</p>

                        <p>9. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> said he had
                            seen General <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> that morning
                            at Ministerial ceremonies and asked him about the status. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> had said that he had
                            prepared new proposals and, as Secretary understood it, had sent them on
                            to Greeks and Turks. The Secretary then asked <persName
                                corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> for his interpretation of
                            original <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>/<persName
                                corresp="#p_DJ_1">Davos</persName> discussions. <persName
                                corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tzounis</persName> responded that Aegean command
                            and control issues under this formula would be discussed after
                            reintegration. <gloss target="#t_PermRep_1">PermRep</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LE_1">Lagacos</persName> interjected that there
                            had been general agreement in <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>’s
                            Military Committee that, on an interim basis, the 1974 command and

                        <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> went on to note that
                            Greece had indicated to <gloss target="#t_SACEUR_1">SACEUR</gloss> that
                            these arrangements would not prejudice Greek/Turkish bilateral
                            discussions and that Greece had agreed to limitation of its <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> air space. This had been accepted by
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJ_1">Davos</persName> and the Greek
                            Government. <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> repeated that
                            it would be best now to “freeze” the situation but with two
                            pre-suppositions: (a) Turkish side should not take advantage of the
                            freeze to “gnaw away” at Greek rights, and (b) discussions on
                            reintegration should not be leaked to the press. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> noted that General <persName
                                corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> had made a public statement that
                            was an irritant to Greek public opinion as well as to the Greek
                            political opposition.</p>
                        <p>11. If matter is further aired in public and opposition asks questions in
                            Parliament on Greek reintegration issue, <persName corresp="#p_KK_1"
                                >Karamanlis</persName> government would have to describe its
                            proposals of 18 months ago and to admit there had been a Turkish “veto”
                            of these proposals.</p>
                        <p>12. <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> said that Americans
                            will recall that in the 1974–5 period, the opposition had harped on the
                            theme of Greece leaving the Alliance. At that time a state of mind
                            existed in Greece which was inimical to <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss>. He cited an example in May 1976 when he was in danger
                            of being stoned on Rhodes when he went there in the wake of protests
                            against a US ship visit. Now, however, Greek public opinion has changed
                            radically as the government has succeeded in demonstrating that a Greek
                            relationship to <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> is of benefit to
                            Greece as well as to the Alliance. <persName corresp="#p_RG_1"
                                >Rallis</persName> asked that the Secretary join their efforts so
                            that this state of mind is preserved.</p>
                        <p>13. <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> claimed that Greece has
                            been “chivalrous” to Turkey. Last December at the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> Ministerial <persName
                                corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> had said that Turkey should
                            receive economic assistance first because of its problems. Greece also
                            could have postponed decisions to assist Turkey in <gloss
                                target="#t_OECD_1">OECD</gloss>, but adopted instead an attitude
                            which facilitated assistance to Turkey. Greece has adopted this position
                            because it believes Turkey is at least as indispensable to <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> as Greece is. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> said that this does not seem to
                            be the Turkish approach. Turkey believes that she can put forward ideas
                            which are against Greek interests. <persName corresp="#p_RG_1"
                                >Rallis</persName> added that he had talked to <persName
                                corresp="#p_LJM_1">Luns</persName> and stressed to him the need to
                            keep details of reintegration <pb n="581" facs="0614" xml:id="pg_581"
                            />discussions out of the newspapers if Greek Government is to be able to
                            maintain the existing public psychology.</p>
                        <p>14. Secretary told <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> that it
                            was not our desire to adversely affect Greek public opinion on <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>. In fact, there was nothing further
                            from our minds and disclosure will not come from us. Secretary repeated
                            that General <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> had told him
                            that he had developed a set of revised proposals. Counselor <persName
                                corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> interjected that he understood
                            that these proposals had been sent yesterday. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> said that he knew nothing of
                            this and had talked by telephone to the Prime Minister who didn’t know
                            anything either. According to <persName corresp="#p_RG_1"
                                >Rallis</persName>, Secretary General <persName corresp="#p_LJM_1"
                                >Luns</persName> had the impression that gap on reintegration
                            between Greece and Turkey is closing. <persName corresp="#p_RG_1"
                                >Rallis</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_LJM_1">Luns</persName>
                            that two sides are like “night and day” and the proposals are
                            impossible.</p>
                        <p>15. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>, repeating
                            that he did not know what was in the proposals, indicated that we will
                            follow this matter.</p>
                        <p>16. <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tzounis</persName> and Legacos provided
                            further explanation of Greek position along familiar lines. They alleged
                            that Alliance had accepted the fact that Aegean command and control
                            arrangements should be interim. Only Turkey has not agreed. This matter
                            should not become a bilateral controversy. Greece had made proposals.
                            The assessment by <gloss target="#t_SACEUR_1">SACEUR</gloss> was
                            favorable, and only Turkey had objected. General <persName
                                corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> is not a mediator but had been
                            given a fact-finding mission. Greeks had agreed that command and control
                            arrangements could be discussed after reintegration. Problem now was
                            between Alliance and Turkey; it was not a bilateral one.</p>
                        <p>17. <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> then described
                                <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName>’ visits to Syria,
                            Yugoslavia, and Romania. In all these places Prime Minister had
                            attempted to convince government leaders to take a more favorable
                            position toward US policy in the Middle East. Syria’s Assad had bluntly
                            refused, calling <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> a traitor.
                            Romania’s <persName corresp="#p_CN_1">Ceausescu</persName> had been more
                            encouraging about <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>’s
                            importance for a settlement but was not prepared to make a public
                            statement to this effect. <persName corresp="#p_TJB_1">Tito</persName>
                            had been less encouraging, but had promised <persName corresp="#p_KK_1"
                                >Karamanlis</persName> not to take an extremist attitude. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> commented that <persName
                                corresp="#p_TJB_1">Tito</persName> seemed to have kept his
                            promise.</p>
                        <p>18. <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> then stressed interest
                            that Greeks have regarding access of Greek Orthodox Patriarchate in
                            Jerusalem to its holy places there. <persName corresp="#p_RG_1"
                                >Rallis</persName> said that Greek Government had formulated a
                            proposal on an apolitical basis that would preserve under international
                            protection the access of all three faiths in Jerusalem to religious
                            lands and properties.</p>
                        <p>19. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> said that
                            this matter had been discussed at Camp David. It had been agreed that
                            there should be free and complete access by all religions. Each religion
                            should have the right to administer and control its holy places.
                            However, agreement on this concept had bogged down on the issue of
                            sovereignty, and thus the paragraph had <pb n="582" facs="0615"
                                xml:id="pg_582"/>to be dropped. <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1"
                                >Tzounis</persName> thought that proposals that <gloss
                                target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss> had formulated might be a way to move
                            forward. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>
                            expressed interest in seeing the proposal and <persName
                                corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> promised to pass it through the
                            Greek Embassy in Washington.</p>
                        <p>20. Secretary asked <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> to pass
                            his regards to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KK_1"
                                >Karamanlis</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_RG_1"
                                >Rallis</persName> concluded the conversation by expressing hope for
                            movement towards solution of Greek reintegration problem. Failure to
                            move on this was risky for Turks, too.</p>

                                was the issue of control over Aegean airspace. Turkey wanted to
                                control airspace at 30 miles beyond its Aegean border; Greece
                                rejected this area as too large. (“Greece’s Re-Entry into <gloss

                            we are party to its irresolution. As a consequence, our bilateral
                            relations with Greece become contaminated and further on our base rights

                        <p>3. The foregoing emerged during the course of a long and at times
                            disagreeable conversation with Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName>’ principal aide Petros
                            Molyviatis on June 7. I asked for the meeting in order to have a candid
                            discussion of where our relationships were leading us. There is little
                            to be encouraged about.</p>
                        <p>4. Introducing my purpose, I said I had become increasingly disturbed by
                            comments we were hearing and reading, the sum of which was that United
                            States policy in the area was taking Greece for granted and that it was
                            measured only by its desire to preserve our interests in Turkey—in a
                            word, that our intentions here were dishonorable. These interpretations
                            were, in turn, leading to stories that our bilateral affairs had become
                            chilled and as a result, there was an “impasse” in our relations. While
                            no such line had been conveyed to me by government officials I had come
                            now to assume that it was being encouraged by officials. If this was not
                            so I would be happy to have something to the contrary because just a few
                            weeks ago Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName>
                            had described our relationships as “excellent.” I noted that while
                            confirming the story of the <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>
                            negotiations being in suspense last weekend the government spokesman
                            had, in effect, also confirmed that overall we were at an impasse.<note
                                n="3" xml:id="d190fn3">In telegram 4622 from Athens, May 29, the

                            were being bullied to such an extent publicly.</p>
                        <p>5. Without addressing my remarks directly Molyviatis raised the <gloss

                            it was the same one that figured in the Secretary’s meeting with Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> May 31 in The

                            proposals would give command and control authority in the Aegean to
                            “others” and hence are “totally unacceptable.” To my question Molyviatis
                            asserted that <gloss target="#t_SACEUR_1">SACEUR</gloss>’s “latest”
                            proposals made only “cosmetic changes” and were equally unacceptable. An
                            official reply to this effect was in preparation and would be forwarded
                            to Brussels soon.</p>
                        <p>6. In further discussion of this I sought to disabuse Molyviatis of his
                            assumption that the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> has—if not
                            authored the proposals—at the least inspired them. (Comment: His
                            skepticism on this important point says something about the mindset we
                            encounter here.) He was contending that the juxtaposition of the Deputy
                            Secretary’s remarks May 15 describing Turkey’s attitude toward the
                            dispute (on which Molyviatis put a higher gloss) and the existence

                            had not attempted to design the formula for getting there. Molyviatis
                            registered some disbelief when I added that at given times we were
                            uninformed about the state of play. (Comment: Obviously as a result of

                            could “never” accept it. His arguments, which are being reported
                            separately, boiled down to Greek unwillingness “under any peacetime
                            conditions” to have Turkey responsible for defending any part of Greek
                            airspace or even to have Turkish military planes flying through

                        </p>
                        <p>7. About where to go from here, Molyviatis described the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss> as facing three alternatives: allow
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>’s efforts to continue
                            although he couldn’t see how it would ensue “since General <persName
                                corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> has torn to shreds” the
                            arrangements the <gloss target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss> could support;
                            freeze the issue for an indefinite period; withdraw their initiative and
                            seek a role for themselves along the “model” of the French.</p>
                        <p>8. Reminding Molyviatis that the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> was
                            being subjected to unjustifiable blame for Greece’s real and imagined
                            difficulties led us into an unprofitable exchange on the problem of
                            leaks. (I confess to having felt slightly vulnerable with our deplorable
                            record over the last year.) Beyond the misfortune of these disclosures
                            some of which I was confident came from Greek sources, I said I was more
                            irritated presently by a combination of stories and rumorings that I had
                            to assume emanated from government sources; that our official relations
                            were stalemated; that an inevitable consequence would be a denial of
                            base rights. On the latter Molyviatis restated that our military
                            presence is contingent on Greece’s <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss> membership while acknowledging my point that they
                            serve common purpose. On the broader question he excused the government
                            from any control over the press and demurred at my saying we knew that
                            government sources were impugning our motives toward Greece. He
                            professed to be unaware that the government spokesman had linked
                            suspension of the <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> negotiations with
                            other outstanding matters including our draft agreement on other
                            non-security issues.</p>
                        <pb n="585" facs="0618" xml:id="pg_585"/>
                        <p>9. Toward the end I emphasized that we remained willing to assist Greece
                            and that our intentions were affirmatively more honorable than we were
                            being given credit for in and out of government in Athens. To be accused
                            of working against the interests of Greece was unjustified and
                            inaccurate and unworthy of a mature relationship. We would continue to
                            help with Greece’s aspirations in its international affairs as well as
                            in bilateral objectives and that our record to date has been
                            creditable.</p>
                        <p>10. Comment: Once again it is clear that the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss> issue is at the center of Greek frustrations and is
                            infecting our relationships. Our objectives here I’m afraid will remain
                            hostage to its continued irresolution.</p>

                        <p>1. At the suggestion of Embassy Athens, I have asked Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRJ_1">McCloskey</persName> to deliver the following
                            personal message from me to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KK_1"
                                >Karamanlis</persName>:</p>
                        <p>Quote Dear Mr. Prime Minister:</p>
                        <p>It appears that we are now at an important and historic turning point in
                            our mutual effort to return Greek forces to the integrated military
                            structure. As you are aware, the Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, was
                            charged by the Secretary General of <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss> to attempt to undertake a fact finding mission with a
                            view to bringing about the early return of Greek forces to the
                            integrated military structure. This effort <pb n="586" facs="0619"
                                xml:id="pg_586"/>has culminated in the proposal forwarded to General
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJ_1">Davos</persName> and General <persName
                                corresp="#p_EK_1">Evren</persName> on 30 May 1979.<note n="2"

                        </p>
                        <p>I believe this final formulation satisfies every concern contained in
                            General <persName corresp="#p_DJ_1">Davos</persName>’ letter to me of 10
                                May,<note n="3" xml:id="d191fn3">Not found.</note> with the
                            exception of air defense coordination:</p>
                        <p>—No <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> documents are rescinded.</p>
                        <p>—National sovereignty is not infringed upon in any way. Rather, it is
                            confirmed, especially for the airspace over the islands in the
                            Aegean.</p>
                        <p>—<gloss target="#t_COMEDEAST_1">COMEDEAST</gloss> remains and its
                            boundaries are not directly challenged.</p>
                        <p>With respect to day-to-day air defense operations, clearly changes must
                            be made to accommodate the already established command in Izmir and the
                            anticipated new command in Larissa. My proposal visualizes that the
                            coordination formerly effected by <gloss target="#t_COMSIXATAF_1"
                                >COMSIXATAF</gloss> in Izmir will now be effected by <gloss
                                target="#t_COMAIRSOUTH_1">COMAIRSOUTH</gloss>’s advanced regional
                            air operations center in Larissa. Most importantly, you can be assured
                            that, in practice, <gloss target="#t_CINCSOUTH_1">CINCSOUTH</gloss>’s
                            coordinating functions will neither be technically unworkable nor create
                            unacceptable situations for Greece.</p>
                        <p>What the Turkish position on this latest proposal might be is unknown to
                            me because it falls far short of what they have insisted upon thus far.
                            In any event, I consider it a reasonable compromise between what have
                            been heretofore incompatible positions. Unfortunately, time permits no
                            efforts for further modifications by me. Therefore, upon receipt of your
                            decision, I must then proceed to seek the Turkish reaction prior to my
                            final report.</p>
                        <p>We both understand the complexities of the problem. However, I remain
                            hopeful that you will be able to make a positive response which I am
                            confident will result in the prompt return of Greece to the integrated
                            military structure under workable circumstances.</p>

                            <item>Conversations with <gloss target="#t_MOD_1">MOD</gloss> Averoff
                                September 15–16, 1979</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>I had several one-on-one discussions with <gloss target="#t_MOD_1"
                                >MOD</gloss> Averoff on the Greek reintegration problem. The general
                            impression I take from them is that the current <gloss
                                target="#t_SACEUR_1">SACEUR</gloss> initiative is sure to fail, and
                            that the Greeks expect us to solve the problem.</p>
                        <p>Averoff opened our conversations by saying that he saw little hope for
                            reintegration. The problem, he said, is to preserve our bilateral
                            relations. The latter, I said, goes without saying, but reintegration
                            should not be written off yet. He agreed, but it is plain that he has
                            nothing to propose. He said that <persName corresp="#p_KK_1"
                                >Karamanlis</persName> would not act precipitously but that the
                            pressure is great and they have been “put in a corner.”</p>
                        <p>The current proposal will fail, Averoff said, because politically
                                <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName> cannot accept
                            arrangements providing less security to Greece, as seen by the Greeks,
                            than those which were in existence in 1974. The Greek military, the
                            arbiter of acceptability for the government, sees the current proposals
                            as providing less security than the pre-74 arrangements. The main
                            concern is command and control boundaries for airspace. The naval
                            situation, I was told by both Averoff and the Greek <gloss
                                target="#t_CNO_1">CNO</gloss>, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_KS_1"
                                >Konofaos</persName>, can be accommodated within the current
                            proposals provided that satisfactory clarifications are made on the
                            conditions under which <gloss target="#t_AFSOUTH_1">AFSOUTH</gloss>
                            would and would not pass operational command to the Greek Commander,
                                <gloss target="#t_COMEDEAST_1">COMEDEAST</gloss>. (This problem
                            should be soluble with a level of generality which will not impede
                            future actions.)</p>
                        <p>The basic Greek concern, as expressed to me, is for the security of their
                            islands adjacent to Turkey. There is a lingering fear of invasion, and a
                            classified Turkish manual for senior officers which they came upon fuels
                            that fear. They read further confirmation into some of <persName
                                corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName>’s remarks in recent years.
                            Averoff acknowledged that they also do not wish the Turks any advantage
                            in the basic quarrel over rights in <pb n="588" facs="0621"
                                xml:id="pg_588"/>the Aegean, something which he, at the same time,
                            minimized insofar as Greek use of any settlement in that context is
                            concerned. He stressed that it would be politically unacceptable to
                            create the perception that, through reintegration arrangements, Turkey’s
                            positions on Aegean issues had the support of <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName>’ problem is compounded
                            by the fact that they had the deal they wanted in the <persName
                                corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_DJ_1"
                                >Davos</persName> arrangements, and the Turkish veto of that
                            approach puts them in the position of a petitioner with the Turks
                            holding that which they want. This is hard enough for the Greeks to
                            accept. That the US is seen, rightly or not, as the behind-the-scenes
                            manipulator, is further aggravation given their lingering disenchantment
                            with what they see as our tilt towards Turkey. It pains <persName
                                corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName>, and galls him as well, to
                            have the door to <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> held by the
                            Turks with, as is alleged to the benefit of his opposition, the
                            acquiescence of the US.</p>
                        <p>Averoff did not press me to pressure the Turks. He made plain, however,
                            that he sees us as the only force with which the Turks will reckon. He
                            does not expect the Turks to seek a way out of this. He is quite
                            skeptical whether the Turks do indeed wish to see Greece back in, even
                            though there is a mutual security interest in that. When I suggested to
                            him that the burgeoning interest in Turkey’s position in regional
                            security might lead to a diminution of interest in Greece, which would
                            be furthered if Greece continues to stand aside, he said, “. . . oh
                            well, we’ll survive.”</p>
                        <p>He seemed unfamiliar, at least, and alert to the argument that Greece’s
                            remaining out of the Alliance could indeed have an unraveling
                                effect.<note n="2" xml:id="d192fn2">He acknowledged without argument
                                that the French precedent does not support the Greek position. The
                                French Ambassador to Greece [Jacques de Folin] told me that he
                                thought Greece should return to the Alliance. The French have been

                            on whom I pressed this point, was one of understanding and concern. This
                            point, of course, will have little currency in Greece. It may stiffen
                            the spines of those who wish to return. It is an argument which we might
                            use in gathering Alliance support for a solution.<note n="3"

                            <salute>Dear Mr President,</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>The appointment of the new Greek Ambassador to Washington gives me a
                            welcome opportunity to communicate with you and to express, together
                            with my sincere esteem, certain thoughts on the relations of our two
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>I sincerely believe that no problems exist in the purely bilateral <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Greek relationship. This relationship
                            could be exemplary, considering the traditional friendship that unites
                            our two peoples. However, it is directly and adversely affected by
                            problems created by Turkey, which concern vital Greek interests. It is
                            the attitude of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Government with
                            regard to these particular problems which at times casts a shadow over
                            the relations of our two countries. The Government of the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> is undoubtedly entitled to assess its
                            proper interests and to determine its policies accordingly. Nobody, of
                            course, can ask it to act against its interests, although in specific
                            cases, the validity of its assessment could be questioned. The principle
                            itself, however, cannot be challenged. According to the same principle
                            the Greek Government <pb n="590" facs="0623" xml:id="pg_590"/>also has
                            the right to make its own assessments and to point out the effect that
                            these policies may have on its own interests.</p>
                        <p>As I mentioned before, Mr. President, all the basic conditions are there
                            for the relations of our two countries to be exemplary. If this is not
                            so, it is because these relations are negatively influenced by Turkey. I
                            accept that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> is interested in
                            and desires to maintain Greece’s friendship as well as Turkey’s. This,
                            however, can only be achieved if one country is not assisted at the
                            expense of the other, particularly when the assistance is given to the
                            country which is in the wrong.</p>
                        <p>You are aware that Turkey threatens the security of Greece. She has
                            occupied half of Cyprus. She claims half the Aegean, which is
                            interspersed with Greek islands. She has annihilated the Greek minority
                            of Istanbul.<note n="2" xml:id="d193fn2">By “annihilation,” <persName
                                    corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName> was likely referring to
                                ethnic and religious persecution, denial of property rights, and
                                other methods designed to force emigration of ethnic Greeks from
                                Turkey. According to a recent study by the Greek Ministry of Foreign
                                Affairs, the Greek population of Turkey declined throughout the 20th
                                century, but it did not cite any state-sponsored, systematic program
                                of killing or “ethnic cleansing” of Greeks in Turkey.</note> And now
                            she obstructs Greece’s reintegration into <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>I do not think, Mr. President, that I ought to go into detail over these
                            problems, particularly since I had the honour and the pleasure to
                            discuss them with you when we met in Washington last year.<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d193fn3">See <ref target="#d175">Document 175</ref>.</note>
                            But I would like to make some remarks on the turn that events have taken
                            since.</p>
                        <p>It is a fact that the arms embargo against Turkey was lifted on the
                            grounds that the solution of the Cyprus problem would be thus
                            facilitated. This expectation was not fulfilled. On the contrary, as I
                            had foretold at that time, Turkey became more intransigent. And I think
                            that Turkey’s behaviour has put the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            Government and Congress in an embarassing position.</p>
                        <p>It is equally true that the problems that Turkey created to the detriment
                            of Greece in the Aegean remain unsolved. In spite of the moderation
                            shown by the Greek Government in order to facilitate their solution,
                            Turkey still clings to positions which are not only politically and
                            legally but also logically unacceptable. If these positions prevailed,
                            they would result in breaking the unity of the Greek State. Seen in this
                            light, the danger to peace in this area of the world is obvious. And
                            this danger is reinforced by the fact that Turkey’s aggressiveness is
                            encouraged, if unwillingly, by the material and political assistance
                            that she is granted, despite your Government’s declared intention to
                            maintain the existing balance of forces between the two countries.
                            Maintaining this balance is, on the other hand, the reason for which the
                                Greek-<gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> De<pb n="591" facs="0624"
                                xml:id="pg_591"/>fense Cooperation Agreement has been linked with
                            the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Turkish Defense Cooperation
                            Agreement.</p>
                        <p>But what is incomprehensible for every reasonable man, is the way the
                            question of Greece’s reintegration into <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss> has evolved. All the members of the Alliance with your
                            Government at their head, strive with all their means to save Turkey for
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>. But at the same time they
                            allow her to weaken <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> by her
                            aggressiveness against Greece and particularly by frustrating Greece’s
                            reintegration, which serves the interests of the Alliance as well as
                            those of Turkey.</p>
                        <p>As you know, Greece withdrew from <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                            >NATO</gloss>’s integrated military structure because one of its members
                            invaded Cyprus. An invasion for which Turkey has been condemned by the
                            international Organizations and by the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss>, who imposed an arms embargo against her. It is
                            equally known that Greece had declared that she would return to the
                            Alliance when justice was meted out to the Cypriot people. Although
                            there was no progress on Cyprus, my Government proposed our
                            reintegration into the Alliance in spite of the reactions of Greek
                            public opinion. But contrary to its reasonable expectation that its
                            proposals would be accepted without reservations, it is confronted with
                            conditions put forward by Turkey, as the latter believes that she is
                            offered the opportunity to influence through these conditions her other
                            differences with Greece. Unfortunately, the Alliance, instead of
                            disapproving Turkey’s behaviour, encourages her by her tolerance and
                            recommends negotiations on proposals which are politically unacceptable
                            and militarily impracticable.</p>
                        <p>Mr. President, to leave this situation unsolved creates indeed difficult
                            problems for all of us and may have adverse repercussions on the
                            particular sector of our defense cooperation that presupposes Greek
                            participation in <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>. You certainly
                            understand that the impression which is being created that Greece
                            accepts conditions for her reintegration instead of posing conditions
                            herself, offends the dignity of my country as well as that of my
                            Government, which must as a result justify its policy to Greek public
                            opinion. The reactions of the latter narrow the margin within which my
                            Government has to decide whether to withdraw or maintain its proposals
                            for reintegration. I would wish that the Alliance find ways—as I believe
                            it has—to eliminate this dilemma.</p>
                        <p>Mr. President, the ending of the tragedy of Cyprus, the settlement of the
                            dangerous problems of the Aegean and the reinforcement of the Alliance
                            through my country’s reintegration, depend on Turkey, because it is
                            Turkey who created and keeps these problems alive. Greece does not
                            object to aid for Turkey, so as to enable her to stand on her feet
                            again. She believes, however, that parallel to the aid given to Turkey,
                            an effort must be undertaken to make her see reason. Otherwise aid <pb
                                n="592" facs="0625" xml:id="pg_592"/>will prove ineffective and the
                            situation in our region might worsen dangerously.</p>
                        <p>I regret, Mr President, that even recently a statement—in my opinion an
                            unfortunate one—made by a spokesman of your Government on the subject of
                            the contract between the Syros Shipyards and the Soviet Company
                            “Sudoimport” has given rise to understandable reactions in Greece.<note

                                decision, stating that business dealings with the Soviet Union were
                                part of a process of normalizing bilateral relations and that this
                                put Greece in step with other Western European nations. Greek
                                officials further stressed that the existence of Soviet ships in the
                                region was of minor strategic significance. The spokesman <persName

                            States has doubts as to Greece’s attachment to the West. I cannot hide
                            from you my surprise at that. Not only because Greece is a sovereign
                            country aware both of her obligations as an ally and of her rights. But
                            also because most recently she has proved through deeds where she chose
                            to belong, first through her accession to the European Community and

                        <p>Mr. President, in this letter I have tried to review the relations of our
                            two countries. I am convinced that, the feeling of friendship which has
                            united our two peoples without interruption for over two centuries and
                            manifested itself at all the critical moments of the history of our two
                            nations, is vividly preserved deep in their hearts. I believe that by a
                            common effort it is possible to scatter the clouds which at times cast a
                            shadow over our relations. I think that this should not prove difficult,
                            as these problems are due not to a clash of mutual interests but to the
                            unfortunate intervention of a third party.</p>
                        <p>With my high regard and best wishes,</p>

                            for everything except cloudy days in Athens: “Unfortunately, the

                        <p>We now have basically two choices:</p>
                        <p>1. We can mark time through desultory exchanges in the military channel
                            until December when the Greeks may put forward a political solution.
                            Such a <gloss target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss> proposal would inevitably be
                            unacceptable to the Turks and probably to us. We would then be faced
                            early next year with a disappointed and angry Greece energizing its
                            supporters in the United States.</p>
                        <p>2. We can go back to the Greeks in the near future making the following
                            points:</p>
                        <p>—We hope the <gloss target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss>will make a good faith
                            effort in the military channel (for the record since nothing will come
                            of this).</p>
                        <p>—We would be interested in Greek <hi rend="italic">ideas</hi> (not a
                            formal proposal) about what a political initiative would look like.
                            (S)</p>
                        <p>I argued strongly in a meeting at the State Department today that we
                            should pursue the second option. In this way we would both be responsive
                            to <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName> and company and
                            have a chance at shaping the Greek political initiative <hi

                            finding a solution acceptable to both the Greeks and Turks, especially

                            <p>1. After almost four months in Washington, Greek Ambassador to the
                                United States Ioannis <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1"
                                    >Tzounis</persName> has decided that the Government of Greece
                                should reappraise its manner of handling foreign policy disputes
                                with the United States Government. <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1"
                                    >Tzounis</persName> is convinced that the Greek Government has
                                placed too much faith in good relations with the American Congress
                                while allowing relations to deteriorate with the Executive Branch,
                                and particularly the State Department and the White House. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tzounis</persName> believes the Greek
                                Government, in what he terms as a serious misjudgment of the
                                American political scene, does not realize how unpopular it has
                                become with senior American foreign policy makers. (S)</p>
                            <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tzounis</persName> was first made
                                aware of his country’s problems with the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                    >U.S.</gloss> Government when he delivered a letter from Greek

                                President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> at the time
                                that <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tzounis</persName> presented his
                                    credentials.<note n="4" xml:id="d195fn4">See <ref target="#d193"
                                        >Document 193</ref>.</note> The letter was an attempt on the
                                part of <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName> to
                                reiterate to President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                    >Carter</persName> Greek problems as they relate to Turkey,

                            <p>3. Not only has the <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName>
                                letter not been answered by the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                                Government, but <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tzounis</persName> has
                                been informed by “close friends in the White House” that the letter
                                was very badly received and created great anger on the part of some
                                senior American officials. In addition <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1"
                                    >Tzounis</persName> has been informed, by people he considers to
                                be close friends of Greece throughout the American Government, that
                                Greece’s previous policy of confrontation with the Executive Branch,
                                in both the preceding and present administrations, has only created
                                extremely deep anti-Greek attitudes on the part of many senior
                                American officials. In addition, <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1"
                                    >Tzounis</persName> has decided that the previous Greek policy
                                of working exclusively with the so-called “Greek Lobby” in Congress
                                has failed, as evidenced in the final outcome of the Turkish embargo
                                issue, and that it was portrayed to Athens as a foreign policy
                                weapon with far more power than it truly has. (S)</p>
                            <pb n="597" facs="0630" xml:id="pg_597"/>
                            <p>4. In outlining his thoughts for a new foreign policy approach to the
                                American Government, <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tzounis</persName>
                                strongly criticized the Greek Government for seeking “confrontation”
                                with consecutive American administrations. He felt that Greek policy
                                in the future should be one of verbal cooperation with the American
                                administration. He would like to present the Greek position fairly
                                and without emotion to senior administration officials, while at the
                                same time adopting the posture that “we are on the same side.”
                                    <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tzounis</persName> particularly
                                felt that Greece must recognize the importance of Turkey to the
                                American administration and make peace with the issue. He said that
                                the Greek Government should indicate its interest in assisting the
                                Americans on the Turkish problem while proclaiming the importance of
                                Turkey to the West. He felt that a self-proclaimed friendly Greece
                                offering their closest ally, the United States, support in the
                                Eastern Mediterranean would be received with open arms in
                                Washington. <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tzounis</persName> stated
                                that such a change in policy approach in Washington would eventually
                                be most welcome to the friends of Greece in Congress who are
                                disturbed by what they perceive as an almost anti-American attitude
                                on the part of the <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName>
                                Government. (S)</p>
                            <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tzounis</persName> hopes to present
                                his thoughts in the form of a personal recommendation to Foreign
                                Minister <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> sometime
                                before the end of the year. At that time he would hope to meet with
                                Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName> to
                                discuss these proposals. In the meantime <persName
                                    corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tzounis</persName> has begun a systematic
                                series of briefings of senior American officials, including
                                officials at various levels in the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                    >U.S.</gloss> Defense Department. He hopes by doing these
                                briefings he will be able to take much of the emotion out of
                                    Greek-<gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> relations. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tzounis</persName> recognizes, however, that
                                if his suggestions are not accepted in Athens, possibly for internal
                                Greek political reasons, he will have little further influence
                                there. (S)</p>

                        <p>Summary: Greek reintegration was the first issue discussed, and it was
                            agreed that the effort of <gloss target="#t_SACEUR_1">SACEUR</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RBW_1">Rogers</persName> should continue though
                                <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> mentioned that the
                            Greeks could not wait for a favorable answer indefinitely.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d196fn2">General <persName corresp="#p_RBW_1">Bernard W.
                                    Rogers</persName> succeeded <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1"

                                1979.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> also made a special point
                            of raising Cyprus and urging the United States to convince Secretary
                            General <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> to take an
                            immediate initiative to get the intercommunal talks resumed. The
                            atmosphere of this meeting was entirely cordial, with the Greek side
                            generally attempting to suggest a willingness to be helpful in the
                            search for solutions to these regional problems. End summary.</p>
                        <p>2. Greek reintegration: <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>
                            informed <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> that General
                                <persName corresp="#p_RBW_1">Rogers</persName> had expressed some
                            sense of optimism to him in the morning. <persName corresp="#p_RBW_1"
                                >Rogers</persName> feels that his discussions should continue, that
                            the process is alive, and that progress can be made. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> noted that he, too, had had a
                            brief meeting with <persName corresp="#p_RBW_1">Rogers</persName> and
                            found him rather optimistic. <persName corresp="#p_RG_1"
                                >Rallis</persName> had informed <persName corresp="#p_RBW_1"
                                >Rogers</persName> that the Greeks would prefer not to push for a
                            solution that might be unacceptable to the parties; that it was better
                            to wait and elaborate a solution acceptable to the two countries
                            concerned. <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> also wished to
                            stress, however, that the Greek possibilities for waiting are not
                            limitless. This limit is not one that can be accurately predicted or
                            controlled by the Greek Government. He mentioned that opposition
                            interest in this issue had subsided somewhat, but they still ask the
                            government why it hesitates and waits for a better response from the
                            Alliance that never seems to come. He mentioned that the opposition
                            raised this issue two or three times in the last month. If the Greek
                            Government is forced to wait too long, <persName corresp="#p_RG_1"
                                >Rallis</persName> said it would be obliged to conclude that there
                            is no answer and return to the situation of late 1974–1975 which would
                            not be good for either Greece or the Alliance.</p>
                        <pb n="599" facs="0632" xml:id="pg_599"/>
                        <p>3. In this regard, <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName>
                            mentioned that no major events in Greek political life were expected
                            until April of next year. He added that he hoped at that time <persName
                                corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName> would decide to move up to
                            the Presidency from which he could be a guiding force in Greek political
                            life for five more years; but such a decision was up to <persName
                                corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName>, and was not known to
                            others.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> then described his
                            meeting with <persName corresp="#p_RBW_1">Rogers</persName>. He told
                                <persName corresp="#p_RBW_1">Rogers</persName> that the Greeks will
                            wait and hope. He said that <persName corresp="#p_RBW_1"
                                >Rogers</persName> talked about eventual concessions from both
                            sides. <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> responded that the
                            possibilities for further Greek concessions were very limited. He
                            explained that the Greek Government had always hoped that its
                            reintegration into <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> would be
                            applauded by the public and that Greek membership in <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> would not be something that the
                            public or major sections of the public would oppose. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> then asked if the Secretary had
                            anything further to say about reintegration. The Secretary said he had
                            no further ideas at this point. Since <persName corresp="#p_RBW_1"
                                >Rogers</persName> was optimistic enough to want to continue on the
                            military course a bit further, that is the course the Secretary would
                            recommend. <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> agreed.</p>
                        <p>5. Cyprus: <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> mentioned that
                            Cypriot President <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> had
                            been in Athens last Monday. <persName corresp="#p_KK_1"
                                >Karamanlis</persName> had told him that if <persName
                                corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> comes up with suggestions for
                            making progress before the new special Cyprus committee would supposedly
                            begin work in March, <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName>
                            should accept.<note n="3" xml:id="d196fn3">See <ref target="#d73"
                                    >Documents 73</ref> and <ref target="#d74">74</ref>.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName> made clear to him that
                                <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> is the only
                            possible channel to a solution, that all other ways of seeking a
                            solution are disagreeable to others, including Greece. The Greeks
                            believe that <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> was
                            perhaps persuaded that a resumed dialogue is needed at the beginning of
                            the year.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> then told of that
                            morning’s encounter with <persName corresp="#p_CL_1">Lord
                                Carrington</persName> who had asked him which of the two sides was
                            more eager to enter into negotiations. <persName corresp="#p_RG_1"
                                >Rallis</persName> told him that clearly the Greek side, since it
                            had 48 percent of its territory occupied, and the continuation of this
                            unacceptable situation must eventually lead to a de facto partition. He
                            also told <persName corresp="#p_CL_1">Carrington</persName> that
                            negotiations cannot start on the basis of the suggestions recently put
                            forward by the Turkish Cypriots, but if <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1"
                                >Waldheim</persName> has new suggestions for starting the dialogue,
                            the Greek Government will try to persuade the Greek Cypriots. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> then asked whether the
                            Greek Government believes President <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName> is ready to talk. <persName corresp="#p_RG_1"
                                >Rallis</persName> said it was hard to answer such a question with a
                            simple yes or no. He could assure the Secretary, however, that all of
                            the non-Communist politicians in Cyprus desire negotiations and will try
                            to reassure <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> that there
                            is no political danger for him <pb n="600" facs="0633" xml:id="pg_600"
                            />from the left if he accedes to logical suggestions. Once the talks
                            start, the Greek Government would encourage <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName>
                            doubted that <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> was very
                            willing to get engaged in the Cyprus problem again. The Greeks believe,
                            however, that he should try and that this is exactly the moment when
                            progress can begin.</p>
                        <p>7. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> then asked
                            Counselor <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> to describe
                            recent American contacts with the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> said he expected to be
                            in New York on Tuesday, December 18, and that he has recently touched
                            base with the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> staff which is looking
                            for a way to do something, but had not quite come up with a formulation.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> recounted that the
                            Turkish Cypriots had accepted the final <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss> language for resuming the talks, but that the Greek
                            Cypriots had said they would only agree to their resumption on the basis
                            of the May 19 Agreement.<note n="4" xml:id="d196fn4">See <ref
                                    target="#d67">Document 67</ref>.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> stated his belief that the
                            Secretary General should be able to come up with a linguistic
                            formulation that would provide a basis for resuming the talks. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> noted that the problem
                            is not one of just getting the two sides to the table, but one of having
                            them actually talk.</p>
                        <p>8. To this, <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> urged the US
                            and the UK to tell <persName corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName>
                            quite directly that he must not stop the progress at the first encounter
                            of difficulty. He should not be asked to totally risk his prestige, but
                            he has been so careful at times that he misses the bus at every turn.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> sought
                            assurances that <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName> had
                            said he would come back and seriously talk. The Secretary noted in his
                            last conversation with <persName corresp="#p_KS_2">Kyprianou</persName>,
                            the Cypriot President had said that he believed that he would only
                            return to negotiations if there was a change in the format.<note n="5"
                                xml:id="d196fn5">See <ref target="#d73">Document 73</ref>.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> concluded that if the
                            Greeks were convinced, it was worth the effort the US would try.</p>
                        <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> said the Greek
                            Government had convinced <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName> that the committee idea would not help.<note

                                >Nimetz</persName> informally that Greece did not like the idea
                            since it would permit other countries to meddle in the region.) On the

                            pressures to seek active members on the committee and get it started.
                                <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> said the United States
                            would make an effort with the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> to get
                            new language, to get the talks started, and to have them keep at it.</p>
                        <p>10. There followed a discussion of whether in contacts with the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>, the United States could mention this
                            interest of the Greek Government. <persName corresp="#p_RG_1"
                                >Rallis</persName> said that the United States could say that the
                            Greek Government had been in touch with <persName corresp="#p_KS_2"
                                >Kyprianou</persName> and believes that the time is <pb n="601"
                                facs="0634" xml:id="pg_601"/>ripe for a major effort to get the
                            negotiations going. <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> also
                            suggested that the United States make clear to Cypriot Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName> that this effort is
                            being made. In this regard, there need be no secrets about the fact that
                            the Greek Government has asked the United States to make this effort.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> characterized
                                <persName corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName> as a very logical
                            person who finds it difficult at times when trapped at the center of
                            this intense political drama. But they are convinced that <persName
                                corresp="#p_RNA_1">Rolandis</persName> wants a solution totally and
                            should be helped.</p>
                        <p>11. Greek-Turkish relations: <persName corresp="#p_RG_1"
                                >Rallis</persName> noted that he would be meeting on Friday with his
                            Turkish counterpart.<note n="7" xml:id="d196fn7">December 21.</note> It
                            would be their first meeting. He would ask his Secretary General, Mr.
                            Theodoropoulous, to follow up by meeting with his counterpart the next
                            month. <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> will try to create
                            a good atmosphere for that meeting. He said that if the Turks propose
                            something logical, Greece will accept. He doubted that this will happen
                            because he feels the new Turkish Government, like its predecessors,
                            lacks the strength to make difficult decisions.</p>
                        <p>12. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> summarized by
                            saying that on Cyprus, the United States will talk to <persName
                                corresp="#p_WKJ_1">Waldheim</persName> and will keep in touch on
                            this through Ambassadors. <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>
                            also mentioned that the United States appreciated the effort involved in
                            the letter from President <persName corresp="#p_KK_1"
                                >Karamanlis</persName> which Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1"
                                >Tzounis</persName> had delivered.<note n="8" xml:id="d196fn8">See
                                    <ref target="#d193">Document 193</ref>.</note> The letter is
                            being considered carefully. The two sides should stay in touch on such
                            issues. <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> then mentioned
                            that Mr. Theodoropoulous wanted to make sure that the US understood that
                            where Greek reintegration is concerned, there is a limit to how long the
                            Greek side can wait. It is not a question of a definite limit like
                            January 15 or February 15, rather it is a limit that is not within the
                            control of the Greek Government. The US side said that it had understood
                            this point.</p>
                        <p>13. The meeting concluded with general expressions of sympathy and
                            concern involving the situation in Iran.</p>

                        <p>Greek Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tzounis</persName> called
                            on me this morning with a personal message from Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName> regarding Greek
                            reintegration into <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> and
                            re-negotiation of a defense agreement. <persName corresp="#p_KK_1"
                                >Karamanlis</persName> warned that March Presidential elections
                            might result in unforeseen changes and instability. Very confidentially,
                            he wanted you to know that he will seek to move up to the Presidency
                            (requiring a more than majority vote in Parliament); if unsuccessful, he
                            will retire from politics. He is convinced that if Greece does not
                            reintegrate before these elections, <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss> re-entry afterwards would be problematical, if not
                            impossible. The Prime Minister stressed the importance that Greece
                            attached to the maintenance of her military balance with Turkey. With
                            the initialing of the US-Turkish agreement, <persName corresp="#p_KK_1"
                                >Karamanlis</persName> wants to commence negotiations of the new
                            Greek-US agreement promptly.<note n="2" xml:id="d197fn2">The <gloss

                            he asked us to reaffirm that <pb n="603" facs="0636" xml:id="pg_603"
                            />proportionality would be observed in granting security assistance to
                            Greece and Turkey in the future. The Greek Ambassador added that
                            proportionality would be observed on both the <hi rend="italic"
                                >amount</hi> (7:10) and the <hi rend="italic">terms</hi>. We have in
                            fact always sought to maintain this ratio, e.g., the <gloss

                            tomorrow of the Greek initiative and will coordinate our strategy in
                            dealing with these two issues. At Greek request, we are keeping
                                <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName>’ personal plans on

                                <persName corresp="#p_SPS_1">Paul Sarbanes</persName> on the Turkish

                            with the Turkish agreement, but they did feel it was imperative to
                            achieve Greek reintegration into <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                            before their Presidential elections. They also recommend that you
                            increase your <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 81 $180 million <gloss
                                target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> request for Greece by $20 million so
                            that the Administration requests for Greece and Turkey would be the same
                            as the <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 80 authorization. (They
                            suggested adding a Greek $20 million request to the Pakistan
                            supplemental.) <persName corresp="#p_BJ_1">Brademas</persName> felt we
                            should use the current crisis situation to press the Turks to be more
                            forthcoming on Cyprus. Matt told them we would be talking to <persName

                            on Greek reintegration to try to move ahead quickly on that, and that we
                            will resume negotiations on the Greek defense agreement.</p>

                            primary responsibility for the Aegean. The Greeks have consistently
                            reiterated that the original formula worked out between General

                            into a Greek lake. This determination has been fueled by the prevalence
                            of weak governments whose responsiveness to nationalistic sentiments
                            makes compromise difficult. The result is that Ankara rejected the

                            informally presented to the Greeks proposals that differed little from

                            had come up with. Concerning command and control of <gloss

                            Aegean, General <persName corresp="#p_RBW_1">Rogers</persName> suggested
                            the adoption of a task force arrangement whereby the task force
                            commander, not the Greek or Turkish national commanders, would control
                            the units. In regard to control of Aegean airspace, General <persName
                                corresp="#p_RBW_1">Rogers</persName> proposed the establishment of a
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> air defense headquarters in
                            Larissa, Greece commanded by an officer of neither Turkish nor Greek
                            nationality. This headquarters would control the international airspace
                            over the Aegean, thus restricting Greek control to the airspace over its
                            territory and territorial waters. An associated proposal envisaged an
                            automatic exchange of flight information between the Greeks and the
                            Turks in a corridor that roughly flanked the Athens-Istanbul <gloss

                            as unworkable, noting that it also left open the possibility that the
                            new headquarters could assign Turkish aircraft to defend Greek
                            airspace—a serious threat to national sovereignty, security, and pride
                            in Greek eyes. The Turks probably also expressed reservations. After
                            further consultations with Greek and Turkish military officials, General

                            Athens quickly responded by lifting <gloss target="#t_NOTAM_1"
                                >NOTAM</gloss> 1157 which had declared the Aegean air corridors

                        <p>There are indications that the Turkish General Staff was directly

                                >NOTAM</gloss>, and that it is tiring of civilian politicking at a
                            time when Turkey is faced with serious economic and internal security
                            problems and is in desperate need of foreign economic and military
                            assistance. The military’s active involvement in prodding the minority
                            Demirel government could produce other dividends in the foreign policy
                            area. Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_EH_1">Erkmen</persName> has
                            suggested that the lifting of <gloss target="#t_NOTAM_1">NOTAM</gloss>
                            714 signals a new Turkish willingness to negotiate Aegean issues in a
                            piecemeal—and therefore more manageable—fashion. There is thus at least
                            an outside chance that conciliation could spill over into the Greek
                            reentry issue and produce some movement on the part of the Turks. [<hi

                        <p>Greek policymakers, however, remain suspicious of Turkish motives. They
                            suspect that Ankara may have rescinded <gloss target="#t_NOTAM_1"
                                >NOTAM</gloss> 714 simply to give the appearance of conciliation
                            before it became known publicly that the reentry negotiations had
                            faltered once again. These same policymakers also suspect that no
                            further Turkish accommodation will be forthcoming. They point to another
                            statement by the Turkish Foreign Minister in which he reiterates that
                            his government still could not accept Greece’s return to <gloss

                            since he will not have the authority to do so as president. And his
                            successor, whether Defense Minister Averoff or someone else, may not
                            have adequate support to follow through on the reentry bid. [<hi

                            their actions in the coming weeks will show whether they are now

                        <p>On February 22, Greece announced its rejection of the latest <gloss

                            and that Greece is ready to accept that solution.<note n="2"

                            proposal by late March. Although the ultimate degree of flexibility in
                            the Greek and Turkish positions is not known, <gloss
                                target="#t_SACEUR_1">SACEUR</gloss> may soon submit a report
                            completing his efforts without having bridged the gap.</p>
                        <p>The basic problem, in addition to the traditional distrust between the
                            two nations, is that reintegration is a surrogate for
                            maritime/continental shelf boundary disputes in the Aegean with each
                            side skillfully and tenaciously holding to positions which will support
                            or not prejudice its civil case.</p>
                        <p>The Greek announcement reflects <persName corresp="#p_KK_1"
                                >Karamanlis</persName>’ concern that the reintegration issue could
                            be used against him or his party in the presidential election to be held
                            no later than 20 May. He had told us earlier that the imminence of the
                            election required the issue to be resolved by the end of March. Since
                            the Greek Government did not see the <gloss target="#t_SACEUR_1"
                                >SACEUR</gloss> efforts developing what were considered to be
                            politically acceptable arrangements, <persName corresp="#p_KK_1"
                                >Karamanlis</persName> preemptively rejected them and re<pb n="608"
                                facs="0641" xml:id="pg_608"/>verted to <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1"
                                >Haig</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_DJ_1">Davos</persName>, a
                            position he could politically defend. Having taken this position, he
                            probably will not need formally to withdraw Greece’s reintegration
                            request, although this possibility cannot be excluded. Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> told Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_MRJ_1">McCloskey</persName> the Greeks might
                            raise the issue at the political level during the June 25–26 <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> Ministerial, implying they will not
                            withdraw the request prior to the Ministerial.</p>
                        <p>At a maximum, we should build on the <gloss target="#t_SACEUR_1"
                                >SACEUR</gloss> effort to achieve reintegration or develop some
                            basis for improved Greek relations with the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss> military wing. We must avoid any withdrawal of
                            Greece’s application for reintegration or a serious estrangement between
                            Greece and <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> over reintegration. In
                            Greece, any estrangement would be blamed on the US, thereby damaging our
                            bilateral relations and possibly endangering our military basing rights.
                            In the US, some political elements would blame it on Turkey and the
                            Administration’s failure to overcome a “Turkish veto,” and create
                            difficulties for our efforts to provide adequate assistance. At a
                            minimum, we need a continuation of Greece’s present level of
                            participation in the Alliance, and maintenance of US-Greek relations
                            that allow continued operation of US facilities in Greece.</p>
                        <p>There are a number of strategies to achieve this. A basic choice lies
                            between using <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> processes or direct
                            US mediation. Some strategies involve greater participation by other
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> allies in established <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> bodies, or specially established
                            sub-groups thereof, to continue the reintegration dialogue; the Greeks
                            and Turks would participate either as members of the groups or negotiate
                            face-to-face with them. Others involve intermediaries such as <gloss
                                target="#t_SACEUR_1">SACEUR</gloss>, wisemen, or the US. The
                            strategy selected would be dependent on the final outcome of <gloss
                                target="#t_SACEUR_1">SACEUR</gloss>’s current efforts. Section VI of
                            this paper examines these strategies.</p>
                        <p>What we must do now to preclude a precipitous Greek action on the
                            completion of <gloss target="#t_SACEUR_1">SACEUR</gloss>’s efforts is to
                            tell the Greeks, without in any way promising a more favorable outcome,
                            that due to the importance of the issue, we are actively exploring with
                            Secretary General <persName corresp="#p_LJM_1">Luns</persName> and key
                            allies means to continue the reintegration dialogue following the
                            completion of <gloss target="#t_SACEUR_1">SACEUR</gloss>’s efforts.</p>

                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName> withdrew
                            the Greek armed forces from the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                            military command structure in August 1974, because the Alliance had not
                            prevented the Turkish intervention on Cyprus which almost led to war
                            between Greece and Turkey. <persName corresp="#p_KK_1"
                                >Karamanlis</persName> informed the Alliance of his decision in a
                            letter dated August 28, 1974, the operative paragraphs of which are:</p>

                        <p>“If the Alliance was not in a position to prevent armed conflict between
                            two of its members, would it be able to come to their succour in the
                            event of a danger from outside? My government have, therefore, decided
                            that they must assume themselves the protection of the independence of
                            Greece and place again the Greek land, sea and air forces heretofore
                            assigned to the integrated allied military organization under national
                            command.</p>

                            of the permanent presence on Greek soil of foreign military

                        <p>Greece then withdrew its armed forces from commitment to <gloss

                            Military Committee and the Nuclear Planning Group. Greece pulled out of
                            the joint US/Greek/Turkish land and air command at Izmir, but continued
                            some degree of participation in <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                            higher military headquarters; the Commander of the Greek Navy continued
                            to wear a <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> hat as Commander,
                            Mediterranean East Area. Greece also continued to participate in other
                            Alliance activities such as certain exercises.</p>
                        <p>(On October 21, 1976, the Greeks quietly earmarked most of their nuclear
                            capable forces for assignment to <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>,
                            indicating they would come under <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                            control after reinforced alert and would remain under national command
                            in peacetime.)</p>
                        <p>In August 1975, Greece indicated an interest in reintegrating and
                            subsequently in September and October set forth its position on
                            reintegration. This was done, despite the fact that the Cyprus dispute
                            remained unresolved, as part of <persName corresp="#p_KK_1"
                                >Karamanlis</persName>’ policy of binding Greece to the West through

                                >EC</gloss> membership. Pressure from the Greek military to return,
                            and the pervasive Greek fear of Turkey which closer <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> membership would help alleviate were
                            probably also factors in the Greek decision.</p>
                        <p>Turkey objected to the Greek position in the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"

                            <gloss target="#t_DPC_1">DPC</gloss> because it appeared to limit

                                target="#t_SACEUR_1">SACEUR</gloss> undertook this assignment and on
                            June 19, 1978, reported to the Military Committee that the responses to
                            the military questions he had received from the Greek Armed Forces
                            Chief, General <persName corresp="#p_DJ_1">Davos</persName>, provided a
                            workable framework for the return of Greece to the integrated military
                            structure. The Greeks, to the chagrin of <gloss target="#t_SACEUR_1"
                                >SACEUR</gloss>, labelled these as the <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1"
                                >Haig</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_DJ_1">Davos</persName>
                            Arrangements, a key element of which was the utilization, on an interim
                            basis, of the pre-1974 air and naval command boundaries in the Aegean.
                            These boundaries gave Greece control of the Aegean up to a line
                            equidistant between the Eastern Aegean Greek islands and the Turkish
                            mainland, which essentially coincides with the Greek position in the
                            bilateral disputes between the two countries.</p>
                        <p>The rest of the Military Committee was prepared to accept these
                            arrangements but Turkey objected, denying the validity of the pre-1974
                            boundaries even on an interim basis. Under the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss> consensus procedure this was sufficient to block
                            approval of <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>/<persName
                                corresp="#p_DJ_1">Davos</persName>. The Turks argued that when the
                            command boundaries were developed in the 1950’s, the Turkish navy had
                            been small, Greece was an effective ally of Turkey, and there had been
                            no significant Soviet threat identified in the Aegean. They also
                            contended that there were problems with the pre-1974 arrangements on
                            procedural grounds, since the boundaries, had not been endorsed at the
                            political level in <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> and the air
                            defense boundaries in the Aegean had been established in 1964 without
                            seeking Turkish approval. Behind these technical reasons were Turkish
                            concerns that the pre-1974 boundaries did not provide adequate
                            protection for Turkey from attack over the Aegean, including from
                            Greece, and, more importantly, the belief that the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> boundaries might in some way be used
                            as a precedent for denying Turkish civil boundary claims in the Aegean.
                            The Turks also realized that, were Greece to be reintegrated using the
                            pre-1974 boundaries even on an interim basis, <pb n="611" facs="0644"

                        <p>It was agreed at the meeting that the current <persName

                            side was looking for a sensible solution and that we should try to keep
                            the negotiating process going. The Greeks had apparently decided not to
                            move on the problem before their Presidential election; however, there
                            was no indication of any immediate risk that Greece would withdraw its
                            reintegration application and no sign the Greeks were looking for a
                            showdown. All participants were against a <pb n="612" facs="0645"

                            mediating initiative at this time because the chances of success were so
                            slight and agreement was reached that we should instead use <gloss

                            alive. We will propose that a small number of countries (<gloss

                            group (<gloss target="#t_OEG_1">OEG</gloss>) on reintegration. We will

                            could threaten continuation of the present level of Greek cooperation
                            with the Alliance, thereby endangering US-Greek relations and the
                            operation of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> military facilities in
                            Greece. The PRC did decide to consult with General <persName
                                corresp="#p_RBW_1">Rogers</persName> to emphasize the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> view that the issue should remain in
                            the <gloss target="#t_SACEUR_1">SACEUR</gloss> channel as long as
                            General <persName corresp="#p_RBW_1">Rogers</persName> thinks he has a
                            possibility of success. Should he not succeed, the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> would propose that consideration of
                            the issue be moved to a small sub-group (US, UK, <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss>) of the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss> Open-Ended Group (<gloss target="#t_OEG_1"
                            >OEG</gloss>). The Turks and the Greeks would be urged to
                            participate.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">CURRENT SITUATION</p>
                        <p>The Greeks appeared to want to force an end to the <gloss
                                target="#t_SACEUR_1">SACEUR</gloss> effort by the end of March. They
                            let that deadline slip, possibly because it became evident this tactic
                            would not result in reintegration on their terms. General <persName
                                corresp="#p_RBW_1">Rogers</persName> has indicated informally to us
                            since the March 20 PRC meeting that the Turkish responses to his latest
                            proposals may meet some Greek concerns. In order to ascertain whether
                            that is the case, he plans to meet again with the Turkish Chief of
                            Staff, General <persName corresp="#p_EK_1">Evren</persName>, for further
                            discussions and, depending on their outcome, will consider a further
                            approach to the Greeks.</p>
                        <p>No timetable has been set for these contacts.<note n="3" xml:id="d201fn3"
                                >The first meeting between <persName corresp="#p_RBW_1"
                                    >Rogers</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_EK_1"
                                    >Evren</persName> took place on July 21 in Ankara.</note> The
                            Greeks, engrossed with a presidential election, have not been pressing
                            on reintegration. The Greek constitution stipulates that a new President
                            must be elected by the Parliament within three ballots or Parliament is
                            dissolved and general elections held. <persName corresp="#p_KK_1"
                                >Karamanlis</persName>, the only candidate for President, is very
                            likely to be elected on the third ballot on May 5, when the votes
                            required for election decrease from 200 to 180. If elected, he will
                            probably continue as Prime Minister until June 20, when he would move to
                            the Presidency. The Greeks may argue that the new Prime Minister, yet to
                            be named, will not have the political strength to make concessions on
                            reintegration. It is, however, also possible that since <persName
                                corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName> will clearly remain the
                            dominant figure in Greek politics, he may decide to use his great
                            influence to move forward on this and other issues while his party
                            retains the Prime Ministership.</p>
                        <p>If <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName> is not elected
                            President and early general elections are required, the situation could
                            become more unstable and at a minimum delay further efforts to address
                            the reintegration issue. The anti-NATO party of <persName
                                corresp="#p_PA_1">Papandreou</persName>, <gloss target="#t_PASOK_1"
                                >PASOK</gloss>, would probably increase its strength in the
                            Parliament, thereby making resolution more difficult.</p>
                        <p>In this electoral period, the <gloss target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss> is not
                            seeking to engage in further reintegration efforts. Any initiatives by
                            the Alliance to pursue a solution could be misconstrued and hurt
                                <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName> politically.
                            General <pb n="614" facs="0647" xml:id="pg_614"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RBW_1">Rogers</persName> is aware of this and is
                            waiting to proceed until the Greek political situation is clarified. It
                            is important in the meantime that we not imply to either the Greeks or
                            the Turks that we have given up on the ongoing <gloss
                                target="#t_SACEUR_1">SACEUR</gloss> effort.</p>

                            SUB-GROUP INITIATIVE</p>
                        <p>The British approached us on April 4 with a range of preliminary ideas
                            for next steps on reintegration should <gloss target="#t_SACEUR_1"
                                >SACEUR</gloss> not succeed. (They also talked to the Germans.) We
                            told them of our continuing strong support for <gloss
                                target="#t_SACEUR_1">SACEUR</gloss>’s efforts, and our belief they
                            could still succeed. We indicated a preference for the <gloss
                                target="#t_OEG_1">OEG</gloss> sub-group as a fall-back approach and
                            urged that nothing be done now which would undercut <gloss
                                target="#t_SACEUR_1">SACEUR</gloss>. The British have apparently
                            backed off and we sense from working-level contacts that the <gloss
                                target="#t_FCO_1">FCO</gloss> now shares our general assessment of
                            the situation.</p>
                        <p>If it should become necessary to implement the <gloss target="#t_OEG_1"
                                >OEG</gloss> sub-group strategy, we would need to get the British
                            and Germans, as well as <gloss target="#t_SYG_1">SYG</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LJM_1">Luns</persName> who is aware of our idea,
                            in agreement before approaching the full <gloss target="#t_OEG_1"
                                >OEG</gloss>, the Greeks and the Turks. General <persName
                                corresp="#p_RBW_1">Rogers</persName> has indicated he would proceed
                            so as to leave an opening for the <gloss target="#t_OEG_1">OEG</gloss>
                            sub-group idea if follow-on efforts to his own are needed.</p>
                        <p>We could expect the Germans, the British and <persName corresp="#p_LJM_1"
                                >Luns</persName> to agree to such a procedural approach, and the
                            rest of the <gloss target="#t_OEG_1">OEG</gloss> would probably go
                            along. The Turks probably would also agree, but the Greeks might balk at
                            participating since this could be construed as negotiating reintegration
                            with the Turks. Properly presented, however, we believe they would
                            accept an invitation to participate.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_OEG_1">OEG</gloss> sub-group would directly engage
                            the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> in this issue. It would
                            probably lead to greater pressure from the <gloss target="#t_GOG_1"
                                >GOG</gloss> and from interest groups in the United States to
                            promote a settlement on Greek terms. It would be important, therefore,
                            should the sub-group process get underway that the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss> be clearly informed, either by us or
                            preferably by another member of the sub-group, that this process would
                            work only if the <gloss target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss> drops its rigid
                            insistence on <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>-<persName

                            explore other alternatives.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">LONG-TERM PROSPECTS</p>
                        <p>If the <gloss target="#t_OEG_1">OEG</gloss> sub-group process were
                            implemented but did not produce definitive results, we would at some
                            point need to consider—in conjunction with the Greeks and other
                            Allies—either further steps or perhaps a hiatus in the effort. Our goal
                            would be to ensure that a relationship continues between Greece and the
                            Alliance, even in the absence of full “reintegration”, with which Greece
                            is comfortable and which preserves our military facilities in Greece.
                            The Greeks may conclude that ending the sub-group process would be
                            necessary before the <pb n="615" facs="0648" xml:id="pg_615"/>Greek
                            parliamentary elections which must be held by November 1981. In any
                            event, together with other Allies, we will want to continue to work with
                            the Greeks to reduce the possibility that the Greek-NATO relationship
                            and <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> facilities would become major
                            campaign issues in the elections.</p>

                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> INTERESTS</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">SUMMARY</p>
                        <p>The elevation of Constantine Karamanlis to the Presidency and the
                            assumption by George Rallis of the Prime Ministership means that Greece
                            will continue to have a leadership with a will to pursue the strong
                            pro-Western policies of <persName corresp="#p_KK_1"
                                >Karamanlis</persName>, but raises the question whether it will have
                            the ability to take initiatives on issues such as the reintegration of
                            Greek forces into <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>’s military
                            structure. The answer to this lies in how much unity the New Democracy
                            party can maintain under <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName>.
                            There are divisions in the party as evidenced by <persName
                                corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName>’ narrow victory (88–84) over
                            Defense Minister Averof in the election for party leader. Aware of this,
                                <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> will initially be very
                            wary of any actions which could create strains in the party. In his
                            efforts, he will be influenced by <persName corresp="#p_KK_1"
                                >Karamanlis</persName> in the Presidency. He may be inhibited in
                            formulating policy until the relationship between the two is
                            clarified.</p>
                        <p>Once he is comfortable in his position, <persName corresp="#p_RG_1"
                                >Rallis</persName> may be bolder in pursuing a strong pro-Western
                            policy. He will probably be urged on in this by <persName
                                corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName> who, secure in the
                            Presidency, will want to see his grand design of tying Greece to the
                            West completed.</p>
                        <pb n="616" facs="0649" xml:id="pg_616"/>
                        <p>The opposition, led by <persName corresp="#p_PA_1">Andreas
                                Papandreou</persName>’s <gloss target="#t_PASOK_1">PASOK</gloss>,
                            can be expected to react vigorously to this policy. In the past
                                <persName corresp="#p_PA_1">Papandreou</persName> has been
                            constrained by the universal respect <persName corresp="#p_KK_1"
                                >Karamanlis</persName> enjoyed in Greece. This does not apply to
                                <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName>; the opposition will
                            probably hammer away at him in an effort to break enough support away
                            from the weakened New Democracy party to force early general elections.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> needs to delay
                            elections, which would only help the opposition, until he builds a
                            record and establishes his dominance in the New Democracy party.</p>
                        <p>For the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>, this implies that <persName
                                corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName>, in support of a pro-Western
                            policy, will want to maintain good bilateral US-Greek relations. We
                            should recognize, however, that he will always be guided by his
                            perception of Greek national interest. He will continue Greece’s general
                            support for <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> positions on East-West
                            issues, but will be strongly influenced by the attitudes of Greece’s new
                            partners in the European Community. For domestic political reasons,
                                <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> will be reluctant in
                            the short term to appear to compromise on Greek <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> reintegration. If possible, he will
                            also avoid raising potentially contentious issues such as renegotiation
                            of the defense agreement with the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            (This may not be possible if the opposition begins to demand action in
                            view of the new Turkish agreement.)</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> will probably look for and
                            welcome evidence of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> interest in
                            Greece and confidence in his government in order to increase his own
                            stature and bolster his position with the more conservative elements of
                            his party who tend toward Averof. We should try to maintain good
                            relations with <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> and his
                            government without pressing on controversial issues or implying we will
                            adopt Greek positions in Greek-Turkish disputes. Any major <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> initiatives on Cyprus, the Aegean or
                            Greek reintegration would put <persName corresp="#p_RG_1"
                                >Rallis</persName> in a difficult position by forcing him to
                            confront issues he would prefer to avoid at this early juncture. END
                            SUMMARY.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">George Rallis</persName> in an interview
                            shortly after his election as New Democracy party leader and, therefore,
                            Prime Minister, said he was committed to the basic thrust of <persName
                                corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName>’ foreign policy. He wanted
                            Greece in the Common Market and reintegrated into <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>. The Cabinet he has named supports
                            this. The majority served in <persName corresp="#p_KK_1"
                                >Karamanlis</persName>’ government, although there has been some
                            reshuffling. The most important change was the move of Constantine
                            Mitsotakis from the domestic economy oriented Coordination Ministry to
                            the Foreign Ministry. The most important re-appointment was Averof to
                            the Defense Ministry.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MK_1">Mitsotakis</persName> probably will be
                            pragmatic in his dealings with us, ever mindful of Greece’s perceived
                            national interests. He was instrumental as Coordination Minister in
                            pushing the recently signed Greek-US <pb n="617" facs="0650"
                                xml:id="pg_617"/>agreement on economic, cultural and scientific
                            cooperation through a reluctant Greek Government.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d202fn2">The agreement was signed in Athens on April
                                22.</note> He was also, however, the moving force behind the Greek
                            approval of the Syros shipyard contract for the repair of Soviet naval
                            auxiliaries, and he has sought to expand Greek-Soviet commercial
                            exchanges which he believes will benefit Greece. Averof has consistently
                            been helpful to us and can be expected to remain so as long as he stays
                            in government.</p>
                        <p>Initially, <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> will hew
                            studiously to the <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName>
                            line, defer to Averof in defense matters, and avoid actions which would
                            test the loyalty of his party members. Foremost among these is any
                            appearance of compromise on Greek-Turkish issues. The immediate concern
                            is Greek reintegration. <persName corresp="#p_KK_1"
                                >Karamanlis</persName> by his February 22 announcement that only the
                            original <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>/<persName
                                corresp="#p_DJ_1">Davos</persName> arrangements were acceptable as a
                            basis for reintegration has established a position from which <persName
                                corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> will have difficulty moving.
                            Moreover, he may not want to until he feels secure in his own position,
                            reaches an understanding with Averof and the right wing of New Democracy
                            which he represents, and clarifies the working relationship between
                            himself and <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName> as
                            President. Similarly, <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName>
                            probably will be careful of any involvement in the Cyprus problem and
                            take no new initiatives with Turkey on Aegean issues.</p>
                        <p>Once he feels comfortable in his new role, <persName corresp="#p_RG_1"
                                >Rallis</persName> could be a forceful and innovative leader. As
                            Education Minister from 1974 to 1977, he undertook a courageous effort
                            at reforming the Greek educational system, one of the most entrenched of
                            Greek institutions. As Prime Minister, he may be willing to do the
                            equivalent with regard to issues of important interest to us.</p>
                        <p>Unless, however, <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> is
                            strongly pushed by <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Karamanlis</persName>, we
                            should not count too strongly in the short or medium term on this
                            possibility. The difference between difficult domestic issues such as
                            educational reform and difficult foreign policy issues such as
                            reintegration is the Turkish factor. <persName corresp="#p_RG_1"
                                >Rallis</persName> has been a hard-liner on Turkey, and his feelings
                            towards the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> are tempered by his
                            belief that our policy towards Turkey is wrong. Greek Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tzounis</persName> has related that
                            while Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName>
                            once told him he had nightmares about new <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> initiatives which would be perceived as pro-Turkish in
                            Greece and, thereby make more difficult the task of Greek leaders such
                            as himself who wanted good US-Greek relations.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName>’ natural inclination to go
                            slowly on issues involving Turkey will be reinforced by his concern for
                            strengthening his political base. If <persName corresp="#p_RG_1"
                                >Rallis</persName> and New Democracy are going to do well in the
                            next elections, <pb n="618" facs="0651" xml:id="pg_618"/>which in any
                            event must be held by November 1981, he must attract support from the
                            center. Indeed, one of the reasons cited for his election as party
                            leader over the more conservative Averof was his greater appeal to
                            centrist elements of Greek politics. It is these same elements, however,
                            who will be less inclined to accept compromises to achieve full Greek
                            reintegration in the interest of Alliance solidarity and who are not as
                            concerned about Greece’s current <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                            posture as their rightest colleagues. Their interest is in closer ties
                            with Europe. They do not consider full <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss> membership necessary for this. Greece’s entry into the
                                <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> on January 1, 1981, will
                            emphasize this point and <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName>
                            can be expected until the elections to concentrate on the European
                            aspect of Greek foreign policy rather than confronting controversial
                            issues which could only hurt him with the constituencies he is appealing
                            to.</p>
                        <p>We can help <persName corresp="#p_RG_1">Rallis</persName> in this period
                            by indicating our confidence in him and his government and not rushing
                            him on issues he is not prepared to undertake. When he indicates that he
                            is willing to address the difficult issues, we should be ready to
                            respond.</p>

                            approaching Greek elections and stressed that favorable conditions for

                                >Nimetz</persName> offered, chose to agree that preliminary DCA
                            discussions could in the meantime proceed. No connection was drawn to

                            reference was made in another context to the question of Aegean balance.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MK_1">Mitsotakis</persName> reaffirmed the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss>’s desire to work with Turkey
                            for the reduction of mutual distrust, and expressed his appreciation for
                            the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>’s positive role in counseling
                            the avoidance of the use of force to settle disputes in the area. On
                            Cyprus, both sides acknowledged that recent developments were
                            disappointing. The <gloss target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss> agreed to stay

                            to explore ways of strengthening US relationship with the new Greek
                            Government. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> said US
                            recognized two countries had some differing perceptions about problems
                            in the area, but hoped both sides could look for creative solutions. He
                            observed that the US has the political will to work for solutions; he
                            hoped Greece also has that desire. He noted the Secretary would brief
                                <persName corresp="#p_MK_1">Mitsotakis</persName> on the Venice
                            meeting and pointed to fact that we are at a significant juncture, that
                            the next five to six years will be difficult, that the West needs to
                            stand together to preserve peace and security, and that strong Greek-US
                            relations are in both our interests. For these reasons, <persName
                                corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> said the US wants reintegration
                            to proceed and wants the bilateral relationship put in a satisfactory,
                            permanent state. To the extent that this can strengthen the political
                            relationship, so much the better.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_MK_1">Mitsotakis</persName> replied that he
                            would meet the Secretary, who is a politician and a statesman, in the
                            spirit of sincerity and desiring to seek solutions to problems. The new
                                <gloss target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss> would spare no effort to
                            reestablish traditional friendly relations with the US. Greek assessment
                            of the international situation is the same as the US and Greece will do
                            its best with its limited capability. <persName corresp="#p_MK_1"
                                >Mitsotakis</persName> then turned to the question of Greek
                            reintegration into <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> and said the
                            Greek request to return serves all countries concerned. He pointed out
                            that the decision in 1974 to withdraw was influenced by the “justified”
                            reaction of the Greek people to the Turkish invasion of Cyprus and that
                            the Greek Government had submitted its reintegration request without any
                            change in the <pb n="620" facs="0653" xml:id="pg_620"/>situation in
                            Cyprus. The <gloss target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss> and the Greek people
                            cannot, he said, understand how Turkey can prevent reintegration which
                            harms both Greece and the Alliance and Turkey. He asked why the Alliance
                            could not explain to Turkey that such a policy is “irrational.” He noted
                            there are technical problems and questions that have been pending since
                            before 1974 which have to be discussed, but Greece cannot accept
                            reintegration under conditions worse than when it left—Greek public
                            opinion is “rightly sensitive” on this matter. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MK_1">Mitsotakis</persName> observed that it is
                            surprising how well Greek public opinion has reacted to the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss> application for reentry and said the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss> is in a position to bring
                            Greece back without facing too dangerous a local reaction. But, he
                            emphasized, these favorable conditions will not continue much longer.
                            Deadlines are becoming shorter and it will not be possible for this
                            government to go to, or to win, elections next year with this question
                            still open. Indeed, there very probably will be political changes in
                            Greece next year.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_MK_1">Mitsotakis</persName> then raised the
                            question of American bases in Greece which is “closely associated” with
                                reintegration.<note n="4" xml:id="d203fn4">See <ref
                                    target="#d173fn7">footnote 7, Document 173</ref>.</note> This
                            was not blackmail, just cold analysis. If there is no reintegration then
                            negotiations, possible agreement, and acceptance by the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss> and Greek people will be “very, very
                            difficult.” Public opinion has been surprisingly receptive to
                            reintegration, but would react differently if reintegration is rejected.
                            Personally, he said, a DCA would then be “impossible—well, very
                            difficult.”</p>
                        <p>6. A third problem he cited, which was linked in a “vicious circle” with
                            reintegration and the bases, was Greek-Turkish differences. A solution
                            must be found or the situation will unavoidably deteriorate.
                            Reintegration would certainly make a bases agreement easier and could
                            also improve prospects for relations between Greece and Turkey, which
                            are marked by “fundamental mutual distrust.” As an example, he mentioned
                            the 1978 lifting of the embargo. At that time, it was clearly stated to
                            Greece that Turkey would be more likely to make good will gestures when
                            not under such pressure; this belief was mistaken and a bad
                            psychological climate has been created. Greece, he said, had no
                            objection to seeing Turkey helped in its present crisis, but an effort
                            should be made to let Turkey know that at least “a small gesture” must
                            be made by them. This is the right time for reintegration to be solved.
                            If it is not done now, he said, he did not think it would ever be
                            done.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> in reply said he agreed
                            in most respects with the foregoing analysis. On a bilateral base
                            agreement, he said it wouldn’t be difficult if all the other problems
                            were solved first. From an operational <pb n="621" facs="0654"
                                xml:id="pg_621"/>point of view the US is quite satisfied with the
                            present arrangements, but it understands the need politically to have a
                            new agreement and defers to the <gloss target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss> on
                            how to move ahead in that regard. Either the two sides can wait for the
                            situation to evolve or they can begin negotiations with the
                            understanding that no agreement would be finalized until reintegration
                            looks as if it will be resolved. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1"
                                >Nimetz</persName> noted that the <gloss target="#t_GOG_1"
                                >GOG</gloss> has the Turkish <gloss target="#t_DECA_1">DECA</gloss>
                            and offered any further information or briefings Greek experts might
                            request. He also said the US is ready for preliminary talks on what a
                            Greek agreement would look like, but that the US would not pressure
                            Greece to proceed.</p>
                        <p>8. Reintegration, <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> said, was
                            much more difficult for the US because it was not something the US
                            controlled. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> pointed to the
                            problem of labeling solutions “better” or “worse.” This transforms
                            military arrangements into political issues when the real question to
                            military experts is how can the Alliance best cooperate for the security
                            of the region. The US understands that military solutions have political
                            implications and therefore a method must be devised to work out
                            reintegration in a militarily sound manner that is not disadvantageous
                            for any country. Especially in an alliance where each member must be
                            satisfied, the whole system would fall apart if better-or-worse for a
                            particular member-state were the only criterion. <gloss
                                target="#t_SACEUR_1">SACEUR</gloss> thus was given an Alliance
                            mandate to work on a military technical level; political approval would
                            follow. The US continues to hope that the <gloss target="#t_SACEUR_1"
                                >SACEUR</gloss> effort can be successful and wants to know whether
                            the <gloss target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss> believes that General <persName
                                corresp="#p_RBW_1">Rogers</persName> should speed up his effort and
                            aim for a breakthrough. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName>
                            agreed time is getting short and that with elections coming in Greece
                            and in the US progress must be made soon. No one, he said, wants to have
                            the matter brought to the point that Greece desires to withdraw its
                            application, but it should be remembered that the US does not have the
                            same decision-making authority in reintegration as it does with a DCA.
                            All governments involved have to be reasonably satisfied.</p>
                        <p>9. Turkey, he said, has given the US assurance that it does not oppose
                            and would welcome Greek reintegration. Turkey has its own views as an
                            Aegean nation on what its role should be in regional security. <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> also sees such a role for Turkey.
                            The US believes it is not inconsistent with Greek security, with
                            Greece’s defense of its national territory, and with its historical
                            position for there to be a solution that contains such a role.</p>
                        <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_MK_1">Mitsotakis</persName> agreed that
                            preliminary discussions on a DCA could proceed, but no final agreement
                            would be possible without reintegration. The bases are accepted now, he
                            said, but if reintegration fails, the question of the bases “will be
                            raised.”</p>
                        <p>11. On reintegration, the <gloss target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss>’s firm
                            view is that “<persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>-<persName
                                corresp="#p_DJ_1">Davos</persName>” should be “enforced.” This would
                            bring a military solution that Greece <pb n="622" facs="0655"
                                xml:id="pg_622"/>wants. The political aspect was introduced by
                            Turkey. Greece, he said, does not think Turkey should not play an Aegean
                            defense role, but he stressed again that Greece cannot accept a solution
                            from which Turkey would benefit and therefore gain in bilateral
                            differences over the Aegean. The <gloss target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss>
                            was not opposed to “provisional arrangements” or to leaving “some
                            things” to be finalized later and, therefore, he wished to see <gloss
                                target="#t_SACEUR_1">SACEUR</gloss> continue his effort as soon as
                            possible and “intensify it.”</p>
                        <p>12. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> thanked <persName
                                corresp="#p_MK_1">Mitsotakis</persName> for his positive view on the
                            acceleration of <gloss target="#t_SACEUR_1">SACEUR</gloss>’s effort. On
                            Greek-Turkish issues, he acknowledged that they are deep with a long
                            history and noted the US tries scrupulously to maintain good relations
                            with both countries and not involve itself in the substance of such
                            bilateral problems. While not commenting on their substance, the US does
                            give its views on the use of force to solve such problems. He recalled
                            the <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> visit when the US
                            relayed from Greece to Turkey concerns about the risks of heightened
                                tension.<note n="5" xml:id="d203fn5">See <ref target="#d8">Document
                                    8</ref>.</note> Then, the US believed it had played a positive
                            role. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> hoped steps will be
                            taken to dispel mutual distrust and noted that the reciprocal withdrawal
                            of Turkish and Greek <gloss target="#t_NOTAM_1">NOTAM</gloss>s blocking
                            the Aegean had been positive.</p>
                        <p>13. On Cyprus, <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nimetz</persName> observed the
                            US was distressed that more progress had not been made and was not
                            optimistic about short term prospects. He mentioned the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GOG_1"
                                >GOG</gloss> have had constructive talks and should stay in contact
                            because problems of the area require it. The US will do what it can
                            toward a solution.</p>
                        <p>14. <persName corresp="#p_MK_1">Mitsotakis</persName> acknowledged the
                            positive US role in avoiding the use of force in the area, but claimed
                            that the fact that force was used against Cyprus and Cyprus is still a
                            victim cannot be forgotten. In this respect, he mentioned the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss> is sensitive to the balance in the
                            Aegean, a balance that needs to be maintained for reasons of security.
                            He also saw no real hope of a Cyprus solution given the Turkish
                            position. The <gloss target="#t_GOG_1">GOG</gloss> would continue to
                            support intercommunal talks under <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                            auspices so as to avoid any further deterioration until a solution can

                            importance but also on account of their urgency. Furthermore, in the
                            light of present political realities in Greece they are
                            interconnected.</p>
                        <p>With regard to <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>, General <persName
                                corresp="#p_RBW_1">B. Rogers</persName> is actively pursuing the
                            mission entrusted to him by the Secretary General. Some progress has
                            been registered. There remain, however, a number of outstanding points.
                            This is due to a difference of approach between Greece and Turkey.
                            Whilst Greece is ready to return to the integrated Command under
                            conditions prevailing in 1974, in conformity with <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> decisions and procedures then and
                            still in force, Turkey is striving to brush them aside. A new situation
                            with regard to command and control responsibilities favouring Turkish
                            political and military aims, in breach of existing <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> regulations—or at the very least by
                            letting them fall into abeyance—would be the price to be exacted from
                            Greece for Turkish acquiescence. This is a price no Greek Government is
                            disposed to pay. For no Greek Government would accept an infringement of
                            its national rights or an impairment of its recognized responsibilities
                            within the Alliance. <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> is a living
                            Organisation and as such there is room in it for gradual readjustment
                            and improvement. But these should be worked out in accordance with the
                            spirit and the letter of its texts and in conformity with established
                            procedures, and not by way of a reintegration fee to be paid in
                            advance.</p>
                        <p>Besides this substantive consideration, any departure from valid texts
                            and practice would create a novel situation unacceptable not only <pb
                                n="624" facs="0657" xml:id="pg_624"/>to the Government but also to
                            the Greek people and Parliament whose ratification would then be legally
                            required.</p>
                        <p>I come now to the American bases and I shall use the language of candour
                            and sincerity that befits the relationship between old friends and
                            allies. Foreign bases are not nowadays a popular issue, unless they
                            operate in active partnership with the host country, in the context of
                            an Allied military structure and in pursuit of common defence aims.
                            Greek public opinion would hardly tolerate the continued operation of
                            the American bases if the rift in <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                            >NATO</gloss>’s southern flank is allowed to continue. It is the role of
                            a Government to enlighten and to lead but it is also its democratic duty
                            to heed the will of the people. For on the will of the people rests its
                            survival.</p>
                        <p>Moreover what would be the practical value of military bases on foreign
                            land if surrounded by a resentful and hostile local population?</p>
                        <p>I tried, Mr. President, to give a short and factual description of the
                            situation. The connection between the issues of Greece’s return to the
                            military structure of <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> and the
                            maintenance of the American bases in Greece is dictated by hard facts
                            and it is not made for tactical reasons. This is easily discernible to
                            anyone with even little grasp of the present political trends in

                        <p>Not only that. Time is fast running short for the settlement of these
                            twin issues. In a few months time we shall be holding general elections.
                            No Government is prepared to submit to the people’s verdict whilst such
                            emotional issues remain pending. They will have to be disposed of, in
                            time, one way or another.</p>
                        <p>I thought it my duty to send you this message not only for the sake of
                            the record, but also because I am convinced that Turkey, whose veto
                            perpetuates the present split in the southern flank of the Alliance, has
                            many good reasons to be grateful to the United States and to other
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> Allies. The new Government of
                            Turkey is presented with an excellent opportunity to put in practice its
                            professions of faith to the Alliance.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_RBW_1">Bernie Rogers</persName> is very close to
                            closing a deal on this matter. Although he continues to hide his cards
                            from us, he was last week only a few words short of an agreement which
                            both the Greeks and Turks could buy. His solution to the problem is
                            apparently fuzzy and defers the Command Boundary decision which is the
                            most contentious issue between the two sides.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile the Greeks have launched an all out offensive designed to force
                            us to put overwhelming pressure on the Turks. We have received from the
                            British the attached letter at Tab I from <persName corresp="#p_RG_1"

                            Greek judgment that they now have maximum influence over us because of
                            our election, and that it is obligatory to get this issue out of the way
                            before the Greek pre-election campaign begins in earnest at the end of
                            the year. The election will probably occur in May or June of next

                                regarding the “top priority” of Greek reintegration into <gloss

                                Generals now in control would appreciate the “military importance”
                                of reintegration. <persName corresp="#p_MES_1">Muskie</persName>

                        </opener>
                        <p>From our occasional meetings, in our present capacities I was left with a
                            lasting impression: Your devotion to the ideals of the Western Alliance
                            and your unstinted efforts for the strengthening of its defences. It is
                            this impression that impels me to appeal to you on the question of
                            Greece’s return to the military structure of <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>I do not intend to elaborate on the causes which led Greece, in August
                            1974, to withdraw from the Integrated Command or on the condition—still
                            unfulfilled—that was then set for its return. Suffice it to recall that
                            on Greek initiative, in January 1977, a process for relinking Greece to
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>’s Integrated Command was set
                            in motion.</p>
                        <p>In the spring 1978 an understanding, based on the Greek responses to the
                            Open Ended Group issues, was reached between General <persName
                                corresp="#p_HAM_1">A. Haig</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJ_1">J. Davos</persName>, the then <gloss
                                target="#t_SACEUR_1">Saceur</gloss> and Chief of the Hellenic
                            Defence Staff respectively. This understanding considered by General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> as an appropriate
                            framework for Greece’s reintegration was aborted owing to the opposition
                            of one member of the Alliance.</p>
                        <p>As you are aware, General <persName corresp="#p_RBW_1">B.
                                Rogers</persName>, the new <gloss target="#t_SACEUR_1"
                                >Saceur</gloss>, is currently carrying out a mission of
                            clarification on contentious issues, at the request of the Secretary
                            General of <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>. This mission despite
                            some progress recorded still lingers on. The reason for it, as I see it,
                            is a conceptual difference in approach. Greece is ready to return to the
                            military structure of the Alliance with rights, duties and
                            responsibilities deriving from <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                            decisions, documents and procedures in force in 1974 and still valid
                            to-day. On the other side Turkey seems to approach the problem of
                            command and control responsibilities by making short shrift of these
                            fundamental and binding instruments. The creation of a new situation to
                            suit the political and military aims of that member-state or, at best,
                            the creation of a legal vacuum, seems to be set as a prior condition for
                            lifting the Turkish veto.</p>
                        <p>No Greek Government can accept to pay a price which amounts to forsaking
                            legal rights or relinquishing acknowledged responsibilities <pb n="627"
                                facs="0660" xml:id="pg_627"/>under valid <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss> regulations and procedures. Needless to add that
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> as a living Organisation is
                            open to adaptation and development. But these could be brought about
                            only in conformity with existing texts and practice, and not by way of a
                            re-entry fee to be exacted in advance.</p>
                        <p>The time factor is also of the essence. Relinkage to the military
                            structure of <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>, does not command,
                            as it is to be expected approval throughout the political spectrum in
                            Greece. Even among staunch supporters—and this is the disquieting
                            element in the equation—there are many who consider national dignity
                            hurt, after being left to cool our heels for four years. As the time for
                            the next general election is approaching, it becomes more and more
                            imperative that the reintegration endeavour be brought to a conclusion:
                            by agreement, if possible, by abandonment otherwise.</p>
                        <p>The latter development would be doubly unfortunate since it will
                            inevitably affect the continuance of American bases in Greece. There is
                            a strong feeling in Greek public opinion that these bases can only be
                            maintained in the operational context of an Allied defence structure.
                            And this is a feeling that no democratic Government can ignore.</p>
                        <p>The United States, Mr. Secretary, has earned in its recent History titles
                            to the gratitude of many countries and Turkey is certainly one of them.
                            Seldom though an individual virtue, gratefulness is even less a
                            collective one. Yet a lingering sense of moral debt could provide
                            leverage for a clearer perception of the situation confronting us. And I
                            am convinced that the healing of the rift in the southern flank of
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> can be perceived as being
                            also in Turkey’s enlightened and long term interest. It is my earnest
                            hope that the new Government of Turkey will rise to the occasion, by
                            translating into facts its proclaimed faith in the Alliance.</p>

                        <p>It is generally agreed among Greek-Americans that the reintegration of
                            Greece into <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> is their highest
                            priority issue. It is also generally agreed, because of the new Turkish
                            Government, that there has never been a better opportunity to do this
                            than right now.</p>
                        <p>Everyone knows the generals don’t have to be accountable to a political
                            party.</p>
                        <p>Reports from the Greek community indicate that Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_MES_1">Muskie</persName> had an unsatisfactory meeting
                            with the Greek Foreign Minister. Word of these meetings spreads like
                            wild fire.<note n="2" xml:id="d207fn2">See <ref target="#d205fn3"

                        <p>Most Greek-Americans are democrats and would like to support the
                            President. Greek-American political leaders are mostly democrats
                                (<persName corresp="#p_BJ_1">Brademas</persName>, <persName

                            cannot until there is a signal that we have made some progress on the
                            reintegration issue and/or on the Cyprus issue. Most of them can’t
                            address a Greek-American gathering and discuss the President because of
                            the animosity. Once there is a signal they can go to work. For example,
                            there are three hundred thousand Greek-Americans in Chicago alone. This
                            vote could be the margin of victory for us in the election because
                            Illinois may be the pivotal state. Right now we would lose that
                            vote.</p>
                        <p>I suggest we need more focus on this issue. I believe the President
                            should assign one person the responsibility of completing reintegration
                            within a definite time frame (not more than 2 to 3 weeks). Then we will
                            be able to accomplish the additional political jobs we really must do.
                            There are two reasons which can be stated to deal with the argument that
                            any action now is political.</p>
                        <p>The first is the change in the Turkish leadership which makes progress
                            achievable; the second, is the announcement by the Greek Government of
                            the January 1 deadline.</p>

                        <p>The importance of this effort to the continuance of our presence in this
                            building cannot be overemphasized. Let me know what I can do to
                            help.</p>

                        </opener>
                        <p>I was very glad to receive your views on the very important matter of
                            Greece’s return to the military structure of <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss>.<note n="2" xml:id="d208fn2">See <ref target="#d206"
                                    >Document 206</ref>.</note> Your gracious observation about my
                            efforts on behalf of the Alliance touches me, coming as it does from one
                            of such long-standing and courageous service on behalf of the shared
                            ideals and goals that bind our countries together. Your long record of
                            statesmanlike support of the Alliance encourages me to reply with equal
                            candor.</p>
                        <p>We have made clear to the Government of Turkey the importance we attach
                            to the prompt reintegration of Greece’s armed forces into <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>.<note n="3" xml:id="d208fn3">See
                                    <ref target="#d156">Documents 156</ref> and <ref target="#d157"
                                    >157</ref>.</note> We share your view that reintegration is in
                            the interest of all. As you point out, General <persName
                                corresp="#p_RBW_1">Rogers</persName> is urgently seeking a means to
                            accomplish that end, and it seems to me indispensable that we all
                            support his efforts by every practical means. I am encouraged by the
                            substantial progress he has already made in narrowing the differences,
                            and while I appreciate that some difficulties remain, I am pleased that
                            your authorities are working closely with him.</p>
                        <p>Let me make one other observation which I know you, as an historian who
                            takes the long view, will understand. I believe that the West confronts
                            today a challenge to its vital security interests as serious as any we
                            have jointly faced since the early post-war years. It is a time when the
                            very concept of collective defense is being tested in ways which will
                            determine whether or not a coalition of free nations can protect the
                            values of democratic tradition which link us all.</p>
                        <p>In these circumstances, Greece’s role in the Alliance, always important,
                            assumes even greater significance. The cohesiveness of <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                            <pb n="630" facs="0663" xml:id="pg_630"/>and its capacity to defend the
                            vital interests of its member states are necessities transcending the
                            day-to-day problems which inevitably complicate relations between
                            vigorous and pluralistic societies.</p>
                        <p>For its part, the United States is proud to be associated with Greece in
                            an enterprise which promotes the common security of fifteen free
                            nations. For that reason I hope that you, your colleagues, and General
                                <persName corresp="#p_RBW_1">Rogers</persName> will be able to make
                            a decisive contribution to the rapid resolution of the reintegration
                            problem. To fail in this effort would be tragic for us all.</p>
                        <p>I hope to see you again very soon, in a meeting marking Greece’s return
                            to the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> military structure.</p>

                            that the reaction of the opposition has been moderate except for the

                            move forward on this issue and said he was glad the defense relationship
                            was moving in a normal and healthy way. The Secretary made a special
                            point of asking if the Foreign Minister felt there were any unusual
                            problems in the ne<pb n="634" facs="0667" xml:id="pg_634"/>gotiations.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MK_1">Mitsotakis</persName> responded that
                            there should be no insurmountable problems, especially since the US side
                            accepts that the Greeks would need an agreement comparable to the one
                            the US reached with Turkey. He then described foundations for the work;
                            (a) the 1976 US/Greek agreement signed by Foreign Minister <persName

                            from these two documents agreeable solutions could be found.</p>
                        <p>6. The Secretary said he would be delighted if agreement could be reached
                            before he left office, though he realized any negotiations of this type
                            were complicated. <persName corresp="#p_MK_1">Mitsotakis</persName>
                            answered that he could not specify when he thought an agreement might be
                            ready for signature. He noted that it might not be possible really soon,
                            but that it should be closer to fruition by the time the Secretary left
                            office.</p>
                        <p>7. Cyprus. The Secretary expressed hope that positive outcome of Greek
                            reintegration would spill over to help progress on Cyprus as well as to
                            facilitate progress on other issues that need to be worked on between
                            Greece and Turkey. <persName corresp="#p_MK_1">Mitsotakis</persName>
                            noted that the intercommunal talks on Cyprus were now moving in a way
                            that let him feel more optimistic about the outcome. He felt the present
                            Turkish Government was taking positions that he hoped would make
                            possible a just and permanent solution. The Secretary added that Turkish
                            Foreign Minister Turkmen had given him a similar impression the day
                                before.<note n="6" xml:id="d211fn6">See <ref target="#d160">Document
                                    160</ref>.</note> The Secretary wondered whether this more
                            positive attitude was made possible by confidence of new Turkish
                            authorities that they had backing of Turkish public opinion. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MK_1">Mitsotakis</persName> agreed and also noted that
                            since Turkish military had been the ones to occupy territory on Cyprus
                            they could more easily negotiate a solution.</p>
                        <p>8. Greek-Turkish relations. <persName corresp="#p_MK_1"
                                >Mitsotakis</persName> reported that the general improvement in the
                            political climate in the area, including within Greek and Turkish
                            domestic political arenas, has contributed to improving the dialogue
                            between the two countries. He reported that he would be meeting Saturday
                            December 13 with Turkmen and that the two Secretaries General of the
                            MFAs had met earlier in the week. While the tone had improved, he
                            expected no final results from his meeting since real differences
                            remained. They would move closer together, however. In this regard he
                            said he was particularly happy with the attitude the new authorities in
                            Ankara had taken toward bilateral relations with Athens, and that this
                            made him hopeful that it would eventually be possible to reach a global,
                            package solution.</p>
